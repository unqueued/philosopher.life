title: 2019.05.07 - DeathOfRobinhood: Ivan the Intentional

Dear Ivan,

I am grateful to hear back from you. Thank you for taking the time to write such a thoughtful response. 

<<<
I've stopped and rewritten this response a number of times.
<<<

I appreciate that a great deal. I often have to ponder, draft, and rewrite too. This letter, in fact, is taking me a while to piece together. Writing letters usually takes it out of me, and some take months to write. Again, please take as long as you need to respond! I know I do.

<<<
The more I read of your thought-log (thlog?), particularly the exchanges, the more I find questions and ideas that have already been answered and expressed.
<<<

Indeed, there is a great deal trapped in this sprawling wiki, and I don't know how to build fitting paths for myself (let alone other people) into and through it. Perhaps my correspondence over the past year will provide a non-trivial set of doorways; it sounds like that has been useful for you. I'm also working on [[Search of h0p3]] with my daughter, [[j3d1h]] (but it's going to take us a while, and I'm not sure we will succeed). Feel free to ask questions, and I'll do my best to answer them.

<<<
I also feel the imbalance of information; like, the rate at which we can discover each other is terribly uneven. I'm not saying this to denigrate the medium which you've chosen to express yourself (I find it/you fascinating), but to explain my awkwardness.
<<<

I feel the weight of that asymmetry too. I assume it is something like talking to a semi-blind person sitting in front of you. I'm pretty awful at developing solid theories of mind, especially if I've never encountered anything like yours before. Hopefully, the asymmetry will be less of a burden and more of a tool for you.

<<<
I'll begin by answering some of your questions, both to avoid the pressure of feeling like I have to say something unique, and to even the distribution of knowledge a little bit.
<<<

I will look for ways to alleviate the pressure with you. If it is any consolation, you are obviously a unique guest. No one has been so forthcoming in their opening letters with me; you begin our conversation with what matters most. I hold your pursuit in the highest esteem. 

One thing stands out to me: you are an artist. I am still not sure why I tend to connect with artists (usually my personality is considered deplorable among the artists I've known offline<<ref "dp">>), but that is one of the few threads you have in common with the [[others]] I have the opportunity to speak with in depth. 

I'm so grateful that you've taken up revealing yourself so intimately. I appreciate your generosity and explicit reciprocation. I see you come to fulfill [[The Moral Law]], sir. Your purposefulness bleeds out of you.

<<<
My name means 'God is gracious'. It also rhymes with my last name (sorta). It isn't the sort of thing I'd have expected from my parents, but maybe they were different people before they had me. I like my name.
<<<

Initially, I meant "DeathOfRobinhood." I want to know why you are connected to it and what it means to you. But, I think it's fascinating to think about the origins of your offline name. I have been thinking about your names.

As for my offline name, there are 4 generations of males who have the same first and last names in my family; I guess it is a tradition for us. I have an extremely Irish full name, and my first and middle are named after a pair of twin uncles who died at birth. I don't mind my name, but I think of myself more as [[h0p3]] than my offline name, except when my [[wife|k0sh3k]] or brother [[JRE]] speak with me (that's probably irrational too). 

<<<
One theme I enjoyed seeing you treat is education. I was publicly educated myself, but my dad never assumed there was a ceiling to what a kid could learn and, while he was able to, sought to broaden the scope of my interests to the extent he was able. Are you familiar with John Gatto Taylor? Your desire to enrich your students, as well as the way you approach educating your own kids, seems to reflect his philosophy and is the sort of spirit I'd like to have should God ever grant me children.
<<<

Thank you. 

Your father sounds like a man of honor, presumably doing what he could with what he had. I [[hope]] to do the same with my own children.

I'm not familiar with John Gatto Taylor or any modern school teachers.<<ref "i">> From my hyperreading, I agree to a great deal of his perspective, but I cannot say I've been nearly as effective as he has. I'm not skilled in pedagogy or socializing, and I don't consider myself a good teacher in standard contexts. I'm a solid wrestling partner though, and I aim to be useful in 1-on-1 interactions (even with significant planning, my 1-to-many modeling skills are often radically worse due to my autism).

You'll find again and again that I'm sometimes retarded in unexpected ways. Gatto is clearly thoughtful about the topic, and I can't say I'm nearly as effective as he is at all (though I may have some disagreements here and there). I'm an awful teacher in most respects. If I don't know exactly what I'm going to say to you, then you'll have to wrestle with me (some people have found that beneficial enough to keep paying the painful price). I'm probably less optimist and far more an asshole than Gatto.

I enjoy teaching, but it is rare that I get to teach what I think is important except to my own children. 

<<<
My work right now is the development (story and animation lead) for a kid's cartoon to be broadcast locally. I'm in a rather unique position in that I've entered a non-traditional studio context in which we creatives are actually able to develop content and a pipeline with relatively little meddling from the suits. There are stills all sorts of regrettable concessions to be made to writers who hate cartoons, and producers who hate children, but there's a level of free action that brings with it the sense of responsibility to make something that's actually good for our viewers.
<<<

I adore cartoons! I'm able to suspend my disbelief more effectively with them, and they have been profound teachers in my life. I am surprised that writers hate cartoons because it seems like anything is possible in a cartoon. Is it not prestigious enough for them? 

Your work sounds excellent. I adore that you are a man of vocation and not merely occupation. I am, of course, smiling that the suits don't meddle too much with you. That sounds like a dream to me. I assume that is extremely rare these days. Why is it that your voice is not absurdly commodified in this position?

The fact that you take some level of freedom to imply responsibility stands out to me, Ivan the Intentional. I admire your teleological contagion; I hope you inject everyone with it.

<<<
An example: One of my earliest TV memories. A cartoon, probably imported from Japan, featuring cute woodland creatures living in a Beatrix Potter-esque society. A little mole is playing basketball by himself outside of his little molehill home. All stubby limbs and glasses, he makes the shot, misses, and tries again. His aloneness and lack of athletic ability are enough to establish our sympathy when he's suddenly confronted by a mob of angry animals who've come to accuse him of stealing carrots from the garden co-op. He maintains his innocence, but they cast his name off as evil. We then follow the animals, certain of their just condemnation, away; the show is actually about them and not the mole, after all. We later see him, inside his molehill at night, with a single lantern lighting the room, sitting at his table, glasses off, as he cries into his arms. Through my own tears, this scene opened up a world to me; the idea of people (or moles) having continuous emotional lives whether or not I can see them. I haven't been able to identify this show all these years later. Today it functions for me as narrative bedrock testifying to the positive power creatives can have have when they care about content for kids.
<<<

I wasn't able to find it either (though I'm not a skilled hunter). The description reminds me just a little bit of Little Bear. 

Your story hits home with me, homie. If my [[TV: Library]] were a complete chronology and explanation, it would be filled with cartoons which socialized me, helped me empathize, and forced me to think outside my own box. It sounds like a solid mix of object permanence, developing theories of other minds, and qualia. You may be disappointed to find that I am pretty awful at this skill which I prize. I am all too often terrible at empathizing even with significant effort.

Not that it matters, but your bedrock narrative makes good sense to me. Creatives are often skilled at seeing things from other people's perspectives. When did you start making [[art]]? What animations do you hold in high regard today?

<<<
My primary responsibility is not to the Isaacs, however, but to God.
<<<

[[YWSOAM]] through the telescope of many emerging mountains. Indeed, I agree more than I know how to say. Isaac is mutable, potentially not, a being of contingency but not pure necessity. The image Isaac bears may demonstrate the primary just is the secondary in our context.

It is possible I have misunderstood what you are signifying with Isaac here. I have grown up with that sentiment, but I think it merits evaluation. 

Traditionally, I take the orthodox argument to be that all other duties spring from the initial duty to God. I can agree to a version of that. Upon close inspection, however, I find them to be the same duty, a single categorical ball of necessity. All autonomous agents have an unconditional duty to [[The Right]] and hence [[The Good]] (they are unified). There are possible worlds in which there are no Isaacs who have a claim right over you, but [[The Moral Law]] obtains in all possible worlds. Thus, I agree to an interpretation of your claim in virtue of the contingency of our existence and the necessity of [[The Good]]. However, insofar as there are Isaacs in the world, the unified duty to [[The Good]] already includes [[The Golden Rule]] to them, the second greatest commandment. It appears empathizing with your [[4DID]], however, isn't all that different from empathizing with others. Thus, I'm convinced all your moral responsibilities, including to yourself and [[others]], is just part of the meaning of your responsibility to [[The Good]].

<<<
An example: I was already a working freelancer when I became a Christian at 21.
<<<

If you are interested in telling me, [[W5H]] did you convert?

I do not have a single moment or flashy testimony to give. I was raised in the [[faith]]. I cannot deny the divine, and I cannot deny the two greatest commandments; they are all necessary. Unfortunately, I am in no position to apologize for contemporary Christianity or many of the standard fundamentals without resorting to an over-the-top progressive revelation.

<<<
 I quickly became aware that I was every bit morally accountable in my work as I was in every area of my life, and that suddenly there were lots and lots of jobs that became closed off to me.
<<<

I know exactly what you mean. Moral accountability is built into the fabric of our lives. Meaning drips down into everything; purpose is inescapable. I might still be lost in the desert, but that is the driving force. Most consider such a thing repugnant. You are a breath of fresh air to me.

<<<
 That is, I could no longer, in good conscience, take on animation work that I felt fed upon (and fed in return) human vice. This led to very real opportunity losses including missing out on the career-launching Skullgirls game and an offer by an interested investor to start my own studio.
<<<

That sucks. =/ I'm sorry. Missed opportunities and losses in competitive advantages are serious prices to pay to be moral. You clearly aim to be a man of integrity. I don't think most people pay (or would pay) that price. 

You may have more stringent requirements on what counts as human vice (I don't know; you may find me to be laughably dogmatic in other respects, ofc). Most people are appalled by not only the freedom I hand my children in accessing [[The Great Human Conversation]] but find my purposely handing them difficult or mature content to be obscene. I race to help us see the clearest semblance of the truth (warts and all) as best as we can. I do not know how to demonstrate the necessity of having [[hope]] in what appears to be a nearly hopeless world. I am radically accountable to them and others for it though.

What do you think of animation for adults?

<<<
I carried on in a work desert for about six months until, with feeling! I got down on my face and told God that I'd quit the animation biz entirely if that's what He wanted, but that if there were a way I could stay in this trade working gigs that weren't compromising, I'd sure appreciate it if He could provide a lead. That very hour I received an email from someone who'd seen my reel asking if I was free to produce a series of animated shorts teaching kids English as a second language.
<<<

I am glad to hear of your success. Wandering the desert is too often lonely and bleak. We're lucky to have animators in the world, and even more lucky to have those who sacrificially spend themselves for the moral qualities of their work.

I will be a disappointing man to you on this front. I have had many spiritual experiences, many of them artificially induced. It is part of the reason I have doubted the nature of them all. There are still a few which withstand my scrutiny, so I run with those.

<<<
Since then, I've earned a modest living in education (kids and adult) and non-predatory entertainment. I try to make a practice of regularly identifying areas in which compromise is a risk (the (many) areas in which I've committed to the compromise already are of course, largely invisible to me, and I'm dependent on the honesty of people (particularly people I've hurt) and the Holy Spirit (who I've also hurt) to help me).
<<<

I can see that. I applaud it. I hold your method in high regard.

I think your sacrifice makes your work even more beautiful. You are clearly skilled. [[My daughter|j3d1h]] enjoys making visual art a great deal. I have little knowledge, practically no skill, and zero experience in that world. She is not nearly as talented as you are, but I'm wondering if you would be open to speaking with her about art and animation. 

<<<
I think this may suggest (forgive me if I'm wrong) one of the areas in which we differ. My conviction is, and I have many (no doubt selected via confirmation bias) stories to back this, that The Good is interactive in ways that a simple unidirectional 'belief/adoration' can't account for. This alone doesn't even get us to the idea of a 'Thing-y' Transcendent with a personality aspect, let alone the God as incarnated in Christ, but it's enough to get me to feel like I'm not primarily an examiner, but an engager; someone with Something with which I can engage.
<<<

You //are// a philosopher, sir. Putting this into words is not easy (some think it impossible), and I admire the care you place in this paragraph. I have wrestled with what you speak of long before I ever started writing this wiki. My transition from theism, to deism, to atheism, to agnosticism, to deism has not been an easy journey. I have doubted the divine as best I could, and I cannot. But, I can't see much at all, and you might think it is a kind of purgatory for the doubtful. Perhaps my mind will change again.

Any story you can tell as a theist I can translate as a deist. Every ounce of evidence you have requires no personal interaction; it could all have been set into motion by anything. It appears functionally reducible, and I'm worried it is hubris to think one could see that far into the noumena to know. I don't see why you will ever have public or private evidence of a personal relationship with a theistic God, not even for yourself. Perhaps this analogy might be useful to us, patricentric as I am, my Holy Trinity is: [[The Good]] (God the Father), [[The Right]] (Jesus Christ), and [[The Beautiful]] (The Holy Spirit).

More fundamentally, it is not clear to me that examination isn't a form of engagement, but I'd like to know why you think you are engaged any further than I am; I consider that engagement to be fundamental to my core narrative in {[[About]]}. As much as our common sense might tell us otherwise, perception may not be unidirectionally possible (I'm not convinced it is). Insofar as [[It]] is transcendent, I cannot interact with it. I do not know how or what it means to say it is paradoxically both transcendent and immanent, but they must both obtain. There is a dialetheistic contradiction here no one can resolve, and I aim to have humility in this space; much can be conveniently deduced from that absurdity, and I do not wish to do so arbitrarily.

I am surprised you think I don't take myself to be interacting with [[The Good]]. I am obsessed with it, and I have been since I was a child. I could, of course, just be wrong about what I'm actually doing. I believe I am engaged in dialectics with [[The Good]], but I do not understand what that means all the way down. You get to see me from the outside in a way I do not. I am grateful for your helping me tell myself who I am. Thank you for your kindness. 

<<<
On that note, I found Glenn Miller's Christian Think Tank because I needed to, I guess. At the time, I hadn't come across any other contemporary apologists I resonated with, and I liked how precise (and warm) he is. I'd assumed his format was partially a limitation of the forms that were available in site building in 1994, and can't really think of anything comparable today, particularly since the internet went 'professional'.
<<<

His work is interesting, and I adore his dedication. I cannot say it is the most scholarly work, but it's wonderful. I think the breadth is breathtaking. Computer science, theology, and philosophy: that dude might be an evangelical Jedi.  

Warmth is insufficient even if it's attractive. One of my only major problems: a glance through his work history suggests he is a capitalist or reactionary who profits off the exploitation of others. I think he advises people to be practically evil for a living. I could easily be wrong, but having known hundreds of pastors, missionaries, theologians, and Biblical scholars, he sets my alarm bells off. It doesn't add up to me.

I am struck by the 1st Thessalonians 5:21 at the top of his page. [[The Good]] and [[Question Everything]] are two of my {[[Axioms]]}. 

<<<
I do like to read some stuff in the Rationalist sphere (mostly SSC and its sattelites), but I'm not really at all Rational.
<<<

While I don't participate directly in it, I enjoy reading in the self-described Rationalist<<ref "r">> sphere too. It's how I stumbled upon you. There are some brilliant people in that community. 

<<<
 I'm also not at all as well-read as I'd like to be though I always have a few books going simultaneously. At the moment I've got Taleb's Skin in the Game (commuting), Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares (side-bag+bedside), Bettelheim's The Uses of Enchantment (living room), Hymen's The Ultramind Solution (bathroom), Corbett & Fikkert's When Helping Hurts (weekends), and Walton's The Lost World of Genesis One (anti-social lunches). All of my books tend to go on hold when I find a good novel. Also been on sort of an Asterix comics kick recently.
<<<

I'm woefully underread. Your book choices are fascinating. //An Actor Prepares// and //The Uses of Enchantment// seem especially pertinent to your work. I've not read //When Helping Hurts//; would you like me to read it and discuss it with you? I'm especially interested in that topic.

Anti-social lunches are my favorite unless I'm eating with my family. Lol. //The Lost World of Genesis One// sounds like a book my wife would enjoy speaking about with you. 

I can appreciate having a novel override everything. It has been a long time since one took ahold of me to the point that I had to finish it in a single sitting, often into late into the night. I fear fiction is losing its grip on me. Reading is often painful though; I think I need to muster some courage.

<<<
I like showing off my library, and I like inspecting the libraries of others. I think another thing I like about your project is that is does many of the things a library inspection does, but without the intermediation of other authors.
<<<

Well, thank you.  

Looking at libraries is one of the first things I do when I walk into someone's house. I'm a moth drawn to the flame. I suspect that will become less useful over time as our reading becomes more digitized. Even if I often prefer the physical copy, I've been trying to shed physical books for many years now. I can't find digital copies of some of them, and some aren't meant to be digitized in the first place. 

If you are interested in some intermediation:

* [[Games]]
* [[Deep Reading]]
* [[Film: Library]]
* [[TV: Library]]
* [[Books: Curated Library]]
* [[Psychedelic Videos]]
* [[Party Videos]]

I'm trying to build bridges with my children, shared languages and stories. These have been immensely useful to us.

<<<
Last thing for now, I pieced together what I said "You write about some reaching out to you with an aim to co-operate, or else, to seek help" from the invitation to cooperate on this project of dialectic discovery on your Contact page, and the playfully sincere introduction in Find the Others.
<<<

I'm glad you know it is both playful but sincere. There is irony in my work, but I'm quite serious about my {[[Axiom]]}. Hospitality is a difficult concept, especially since I consider wrestling to be a necessary service.

<<<
Wanting of the sort of integrity and courage I'd truly like to manifest,

Ivan
<<<

By the way, do you want a particular style or look for your letters? 

I am fortunate to have met you in the desert, nomad. I hope to hear from you again!

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
