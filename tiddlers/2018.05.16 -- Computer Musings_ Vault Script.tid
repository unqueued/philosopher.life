title: 2018.05.16 -- Computer Musings: Vault Script

Connecting on Tox with the family again. Now that my wife has a working proxy at work, we could possibly move to that yet again. It is a battery drainer though. I need to find solutions to that problem.

My daughter made this one-liner for me to help me with my notes migration:

`libreoffice --convert-to html /path/to/input/folder/* --outdir /path/to/output/folder/`

i.e.

`libreoffice --convert-to html ./*.docx --outdir ./`
