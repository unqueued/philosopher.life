title: 2019.01.24 - Afterschool Teaching: Older Kids

I have the older kids today. Whitney has decided to rotate even though she seemed to want to change her mind after recognizing she would have the more difficult crowd; this is confirmation that she isn't reasoning effectively. She doesn't know the consequences of her actions well enough. We talked about the Core, motivation, systemic flaws in education, and what her teaching certification is worth (I'm begging her to actually major in something she wants to teach...she's going to teach math and barely understands it [barely passing two classes on the subject right now too]). We talked about how life was going for her. 

I guess I'm in charge today. Alrighty. I took the 7th and 8th graders (and the high schoolers) to their usual room. Not many people had homework, but I made sure they all got it done. I disagree with their algebra books, but what's new? We walked through the problems using a couple methods. I believe she understood what she was doing by the end. There are only so many ways I get to test to see if she understood in the timeframe I had.

It is clear I only know 40% of the older kids names. I just don't spend enough time with them to know. I know their personalities and habits well enough though (I am watching you). 7Jm is largely tamed, 8Tm as well. I let them do their thing more than Matt would. I don't have a problem with their identities if they are going to do their best to find the truth (I won't praise them as doing so, but I don't think they demonstrate a threshold which requires me to push them harder than I do).

I talked with 7Sf about her art. She asked me if I liked to draw. I told her I'm not good at it, but sometimes I do (and I love to look like Mr. Bean, yo). She asked about my daughter who likes to draw too, so I showed her some of [[j3d1h]]'s work. She tried connecting with me on movies too. Teacher's pet knows teacher's pet, though she is far more socially adept than I ever was (and I suggest already more adept than I am). I'm afraid I'm not with it. I talked about the Disney Renaissance and Pixar when I was her age. She was meh about it. She liked my music though. You know what would impress me kid(?): trying your best.

This is the first time I've comfortably been able to play music out loud.

There is no computer lab or gym today. Luckily, we do have access to the library. We were mostly just chillaxing in the rooms. They've been in school all day, and while I'm happy to teach, I have few/no willing students. Those who care about their homework ask for my help (though I intervene on everyone to ask if I can help), but I am turned down most of the time.

I spent part of the day trying to teach basic utilitarianism and the prisoner's dilemma. The ghetto kids were the only kids interested and capable of understanding (they know the nature of selfishness more openly, plus we were talking about prison-time). 8Tm understood enough that we could walk through iterations (and the collapse of trust). He asked good questions which required me to walk through different possibilities. He was trying not to pay attention, but he did. =) I'm sad to see the standard smartish kids had no interest in paying attention at all. Their loss!

I completed half of Matt's paperwork, and Whitney tried her best to wriggle out of it (multiple texts with him). She's sweet, but I'm beginning to have doubts now about not just her competence but even her willingness to attempt to become competent. Ironically, I suggest I would be punished long before her in social games.

5LL's mom feels incredibly entitled. She's hilarious about it. She put the kid in here because she says she doesn't want to do it (her words). She then expects us to do what she isn't willing to do. She also expects us to give him special treatment and dictate the programming. I carefully guided her to the conclusion that she is responsible for making sure he tries (because he doesn't) and pointing out that he continues to lie to us. You raised the little shit, asshole (literally shat him out of your unified vagina-asshole post-episiotomy too). She at least put on the partial show. I am, of course, not a believer. Delp knew exactly what I was doing (and he better after ~40 years of this). He gave 5LL the Come-to-Jesus talk, and his mom continued to fail to back Delp up (or even pay attention: she's a narcissist). I blame history and society for her existence as well, ofc.

5Am's mom talked (nurses everywhere folks) with us. She is concerned about behavior but not focus. Alright. Your call.

The end finally came (praise the lawd) and Delp praised me (though I have my doubts about that as well...I am weird as fuck, ofc). I give him 80% chance of meaning it unreserved.
