title: Aphorisms, Common Sense, & One-Liners

!! Contextro:

//Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Laozi, Twain, Franklin, Chesterton, etc. seem to be doing something right. We must collect, investigate, prune, and wisely apply terse rules of thumb and insight.//

I take aphorisms, epigrams, maxims, one-liners, kernels of thought, and compact intuitions to be bits, nuggets, and essences to not only immediately enjoy but also to inspect, germinate, and unpack. They are gateways to walk through with exceedingly complex thought trees emanating from those doorsteps. There is a special beauty to them, like the fabled aesthetic elegance of mathematics, e^^iÏ€^^+1= 0, or the beauty of fundamental equations in physics, e = mc^^2^^, or "ought implies can" in metaethics, etc.

!! Body:

Intuitionism, the use of our fastminds, is the motivator and decision procedure in casuistry. Intuitions pose a conflict of interest and force us into circular reasoning, but they also pose an opportunity to simplify and clarify, to hold our theories in check and ground ourselves. Ultimately, effective systematic philosophy must explain what is right, wrong, coherent, or incoherent about common sense, wit, and the cleverness stored in brevity.<<ref "1">>
