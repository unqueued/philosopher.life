How was your day today? How are you feeling?
SEP 24 7:34 PM
Hey [[h0p3]] -- my day was rought mentally. It's been a real struggle mentally today.
SEP 24 7:35 PM
=( I'm sorry.
SEP 24 7:35 PM
You feeling that Rut?
SEP 24 7:36 PM
I have had absolutely no desire to do work on days where my boss isn't in the office. That's been happening more and more lately because she's been out sick or taking care of her sick kids.
SEP 24 7:36 PM
Part of me is like: "fuck yeah"
SEP 24 7:37 PM
It's starting to creep up on me, yes. This is more emotional than the Rut tends to be. The Rut feels... less intense.
SEP 24 7:37 PM
You have to know how much you actively don't want your job. It's gonna eat ya alive.
SEP 24 7:37 PM
I know that pain.
SEP 24 7:37 PM
It's true. I need to be better about actively searching and propositioning if I'm going to get out of here.
SEP 24 7:38 PM
Makes me want to puke thinking about it.
SEP 24 7:38 PM
Ugh.
SEP 24 7:38 PM
I wish I could hug you right now. That is such a lonely place.
SEP 24 7:38 PM
BUT, acknowledging that this is where my mental health is headed rather than ignoring it has actually helped in a weird way. I know I can take steps to do better before the Rut creeps up too much.
SEP 24 7:39 PM
Sane Optimism, Sister.
SEP 24 7:40 PM
I have half a mind to take some days off again here soon. It was so beneficial for me mentally.
SEP 24 7:46 PM
A precious resource. I simply have no idea how to spend it wisely even in my own shoes.
SEP 24 7:48 PM
I finally understand why people who left did what they did. It all makes sense now.
SEP 24 7:50 PM
So many people that have left this department took a ton of days off all at once with no warning or just stopped caring altogether. I don't blame them one iota.
SEP 24 7:50 PM
The mountain keeps getting steeper.
