!! Why have you been playing Diablo 2?

I've been itching to play a game for a while actually. D2 is comforting, it is a long-term project of mine, and I get the chance to share it with the kids. This is one of the canonical games I want to share with my children. I've really enjoyed talking about the game with them as we play. I also think it falsely makes me feel productive. It quells that anxiety in me. 

That said, it isn't addictive in the same way as EQ, or at least it doesn't appear so. It doesn't rule me. I don't feel consumed in learning every inch of the landscape; I'm left with smaller things. I play it when I want to, and I don't feel compelled to do it otherwise. See this wiki as evidence. 

I want to play each class through Hell mode and take the Ubers with every class that I can. I suppose I'd eventually like to do hardcore as well. 

Are these good enough reasons? What else should I be doing?
