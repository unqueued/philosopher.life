title: 2019.06.03 - Prompted Introspection: Positive Political View

!! What are you political views? Are you a liberal? republican? libertarian? ? Why?

I've responded to this before: [[2017.11.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Political Leanings]]. I have something more positive to say this time around.

I continue to flesh out my position and drop tent pegs in this wiki. People who think labeling is unacceptable are unacceptable. My labels may not be terribly meaningful to most people though (by choice, from what I can tell). Call it a contradiction in terms all you want: I'm a Metamodern Rawlsian Marxist Platonist who aims to decentralize [[power]] through technologically empowered P2P relationships, democratic e-voting maximalism, patterned wealth redistributivism, and ensuring the means of production of powers are owned by the everyone as equally as feasible.

Why? See my {[[Axioms]]}. I'm a moral realist to extrema.
