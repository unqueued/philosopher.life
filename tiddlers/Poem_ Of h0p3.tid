title: Poem: Of h0p3

```
I h0p3 this wiki torrentially develops into an internet rabbithole, 
a grounds for me to explore, adapt, and evolve.

I h0p3 this self-dialectic blooms into:
quotable insight porn,
originally unoriginal footnote paradise, 
immortal easter egg city, 
memetic wonderland lagniappe, 
and a bizarre thought bazaar.

I h0p3 I can "get it out of me" here,
and bare my soul to myself.
May this be a hospitable place to get to know me, 
to make the most of myself,
even if only for me to accept my memetically alien self.
Thus, I h0p3 this is the good, right, and beautiful life-affirming twin of a horcrux.

I h0p3 to become an effective risk-taker.
I must be a good contrarian, countercultural irwartfrr.

I h0p3 to pursue pragmatic perfectionism instead of asking too much of myself and others,
to manage my expectations (ought) and predictions (is),
and to compete with only myself and never others in my pursuit of virtue and eudaimonia.
Thus, I h0p3 to worry only about what is in my control.

I h0p3 to mediate, reconcile, and communicate with myself in:
open, curious, charitable, and humble self-reflection.

I h0p3 this is a place to explicitly see my reality map in words,
wisely using my mirror for self-surgery rather than self-admiring primping,
in order to declusterfuck my life's imbroglio.

I h0p3 to move from unconscious incompetence concerning my life to conscious incompetence (get woke), 
to conscious competence (hard fucking work, habitual grind), 
to unconscious competence (self-mastery).
Thus, I h0p3 to be justified in gutchecking and living in the ready-to-hand mode.

I h0p3 to learn to get in the "flow" concentration state while writing this wiki, 
wherein I lose my sense of time, myself (in a way), and irrelevant problems in order to:
achieve making my present-at-hand mode feel ready-to-hand, 
especially about the most fundamental contents of existential thinking.

I h0p3 to ambitiously virtue signal to myself, 
decorate this mind-palace with dramatic flair, 
produce a mind for myself that I love living in, 
and continuously make fundamental commitments to my persistent identity.

I h0p3 to chase threads of genius, 
navigate the strands between insane brilliance and brilliant insanity, 
and weave something profoundly meaningful and eminently useful to me with them.

I h0p3 to harness my bursts of insight, 
continue to define my problem space with iteratively-improved heuristics, 
repeatedly re-invent myself, 
and plan a streamline grind through life and cognitive dissonance in this existential laboratory.

I h0p3 to be a jedi metagamer of my life, 
to be practically "meta" about my existence, 
to play the game of life like a video game I'm obsessed with.
Thus, I h0p3 to define the game I am playing for myself. 
I don't know what it is, so how I can I win at it?

I h0p3 this wiki is a Living Metaliving Document,
one which metamorphoses into a text-based object-oriented cyborg,
a digital shadow which wrestles with me.

I h0p3 composing this wiki is the wisest method of laying the foundation for my magnum opus: 
attempting to virtuously attempt to virtuously conduct my life,
ad infinitum.

I h0p3 to learn my lessons,
and if not that, may you learn from my lack thereof.

I h0p3 to build a memetic treasure trove for my loved ones,
to construct a life which makes my family happy.

I h0p3 I seek primarily my own approval, 
and when I seek the approval of others, 
I h0p3 it is done irwartfrr.
In particular, I seek the approval of the metamodern strains of my idols and perhaps some future AI.

I h0p3 to channel these gods of philosophers, 
to be their reincarnated philosophical gladiator. 
Thus, I h0p3 if I were on trial for being a systematic philosopher, 
this wikified testimony would be sufficient evidence to convict me.

I h0p3 this a proof to myself that sacrificing for self-honesty,
in particular, enduring the pain of learning to become wiser,
is worth my time.

I h0p3 to wisely wield myself,
to transform myself into a Eudaimonic Lifehacker.

I hope I am h0p3.
