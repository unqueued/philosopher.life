title: 2018.09.04 -- AIR: Phone

I sent a message to my brother about [[AIR]] being redone. I called him up late at night, and he was crying about it (in a good way). I didn't mean to make him cry, but I'm glad it meant a lot to him. He means a lot to me, and I hope I conveyed it correctly. We talked for a bit about life. He's coming to visit soon, assuming they'll let him off work. I'm excited to see him. =)
