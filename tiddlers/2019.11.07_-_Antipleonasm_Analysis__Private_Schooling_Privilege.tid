title: 2019.11.07 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Private Schooling Privilege

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If private schools didn't confer unfair privilege then no one would pay for them.

If they didn't have a higher chance of conferring privilege, then it would be unlikely people would continue to pay for them over the centuries. They aren't always better. There are even school systems in the world in which the public are the elite. The for-profit privatization of what ought to be a public institution, something we radically owe to everyone, including future generations, is a crime against [[Humanity]].  

I run what is essentially a private school for two children. We obviously pay for it. We live below median with sparse support (we would be in a lot more trouble without my brother [[JRE]] as a lifeline). I can't say we do a good job, but I've never met any kids like mine. Indeed, it's a radical privilege (which isn't to say it isn't a special kind of hell for them often enough). 

Obviously, it would be my preference that we didn't have to sacrifice so profoundly for this. We are regularly told we are insane for the lengths we've gone through for our offspring.
