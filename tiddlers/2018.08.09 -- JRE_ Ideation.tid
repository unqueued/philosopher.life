title: 2018.08.09 -- JRE: Ideation

My brother is feeling old, very old, in his bones, his back, his body, his mind. This is a bad sign. He is breaking down at 31. The end is coming for us, and I can see it playing out in him too. He has been thinking about what he will do with this pain, about ending his life if it gets too bad. He wants to do some serious woodworking before he dies. He's considering living alone. 

I'm asking him to diet again. I think it may solve some things, or at least delay them.

We talked about [[FTO]], things I'm doing, making money, etc. We talked about my daughter setting up GPU passthrough on HTPC for Windows and OSX software to make art.

We talked about the lack of [[hope]] about the world, politics, about where to go! His eschatology is also a sad prediction. I'm racing to find an answer. I actually think that writings wikis and building [[T42T]] is an important step in the right direction. 

I am feeling scared for my brother, again! His antidepression drugs kept him up last night, so they must be having a serious psychotropic effect. It's weird, but I feel like if my brother is crumbling, there's literally no hope for any of us. He has gumption that I often try to emulate.

He was worried about sounding like [[MWF]], but I tried (poorly) to explain I don't hear him that way. I do see him as a father figure though, but I mean that with the utmost respect. He thinks I should put my wiki-building skills to use for making money, possibly, but doesn't mean it in a Capitalist sense. I will think again about it, and I will see what I can do. Part of the problem is that I think I have to solve a problem that it is unlikely I can get paid for.
