title: 2018.05.18 - Prompted Introspection Log: Making Me Sad

!! Did something happen to make me sad?

It makes me sad when I look at or think about the world. When I inspect people, their lives, motivations, thoughts, actions, beliefs, etc. It makes me sad when I see the systematic insanity around me. My powerlessness makes me sad. That I'm forced to watch it crumble around me even as I fight makes me sad. 

I am a witness to Humankind as we bridge into the new millenium, and I'm sad.
