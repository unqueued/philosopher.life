title: 2018.07.30 - Charlie: Faith

Charlie and I continue to have our debate about faith, the epistemic foundation, etc. He still wishes to deny the logical truth of `a=a`, even when we are very careful in specifying what that means. I see the routes he wants to go.

We talked about public key crypto. He's not been using Signal because he wants a manual for it? Linux is going to be quite a world for him, I think.

We talked about the history of computing and the computer he wants to build.

We talked about everything in between.
