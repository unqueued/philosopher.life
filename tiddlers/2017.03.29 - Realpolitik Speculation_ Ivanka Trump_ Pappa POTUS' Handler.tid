title: 2017.03.29 - Realpolitik Speculation: Ivanka Trump: Pappa POTUS' Handler

Ivanka Trump is delicious.<<ref "1">> Even Donald thinks so. She knows it, and it seems like she's experienced it as well. Her body language towards him bespeaks a deep divide in her. I am quite convinced that Donald has raped her (to various degrees) before (yo, intelligence agencies: are you reading this?). The abductive evidence is there; the inference is clear. 

Like all of Donald's children (just like himself), Ivanka Trump financially and politically benefits from being her father's daughter. Donald's sons are mere middlemen between Donald and his businesses (and methods for making money off our government and through transnational bribes). Ivanka's place, however, has been much less obvious to me. She clearly needs to benefit strongly to justify spending so much time with her rapist. 

She has an office in the Whitehouse. She has top security clearances. She doesn't get paid. She does a job though. Nobody has given it a title, not even Ivanka. This is hilariously ironic, considering how she once organized a campaign to encourage women to share their job titles. What is this job, which can't be called a job because it is even legally (not just morally) indefensible nepotism? 

Ivanka is her father's handler. 

He is a loose cannon, a demented idiot that flies off the handle bars, and a psychopath seriously lacking impulse control. She's his caretaker, manager, babysitter, and hand-holder. In a weird way, she might be acting First Lady. She can charm that snake (in so many ways) and tame that beast to some extent. To the best of her abilities, insofar as it aligns with her interests, she keeps The Donald on task, on topic, and defuses his insanity in meetings. She keeps The Donald centered, balanced, and as emotionally stable and calm as she can (ofc, only insofar as it pleases her). She is an anchor which loosely tethers him to reality.

Perhaps you are thinking: "Anything to try to reign him in, right?" Maybe she's the only person that can do it. I don't know.  It is unobvious how effective a puppeteer she is with her father. Thus, it is unclear how much direct power she has. More problematically, she isn't the only puppeteer. In a way though, she appears to be unchallenged, and that could be because even Donald's detractors and political enemies find him more bearable with Ivanka than without. 

I would like to caution against this line of reasoning though. Ivanka plays an absurdly significant role in our government, and she is not elected to do so. That alone makes her very dangerous. Her role is unchecked, with minimal transparency. The habit of relying upon her is forming. Her power may only grow. Perhaps she is being groomed. I wonder who she serves as a means to serving herself.

This is a very twisted version of The Aristocrats Joke.
