Hello, Schopenhauer! The hedonic treadmill is an artful analogy, but Draper's quote is an artful phenomenology compressed into a [[redpill]]. It's outstanding! What is most fascinating to me is how this becomes [[diamond]]ic in cutting away at the marble slab of flatness to produce the [[salient]] sculpture within. Look at it. That principle is absolutely necessary for the virtuous agent to filter their perceptions of reality to determine what is actually intrinsically valuable (even if they do so non-cognitively, so-to-speak<<ref "s">>).
