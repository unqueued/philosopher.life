* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7nnivq/amd_processors_are_not_subject_to_the_types_of/ds3u3lx/
*** I have failed to appreciate what it is.
** https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-arctic/the-economic-arctic/
*** I really hadn't thought about it like that.

* Think About It
** http://wayoflinux.com/blog/debian-stable-on-desktop
*** I feel like Debian Stable has never been worth my time. There is always something missing.
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/08/making-china-great-again?
*** Ever the story-tellers, I always pay attention to Le New Yorker. Sometimes it was rubbish disguised, and other times it was an elegant explanation.

*** Yup. Also, this seems like celebrity gossip. 

* Fishy
** https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx
*** Is this just confirming my bias? This can't simply be about the page isolation, right? I think Intel will continue to lose ground over the next ten years. So many things aren't adding up for them.
