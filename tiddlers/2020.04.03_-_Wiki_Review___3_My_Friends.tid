title: 2020.04.03 - Wiki Review: <3 My Friends

* [[2020.04.02 - h0p3ful Review: Gullibility]]
** I wish I understood RPing better for my daughter's sake. My inability to suspend disbelief is non-trivial.
* [[2020.04.02 - Wiki Review: Having A Baby Is Just Keeping Cum As A Pet]]
** Sad to not hear back from them. As [[chameleon]] has pointed out, it can be intimidating. I wish there was a gentler landing zone into my insanity.
*** Welp, even if we don't get to connect, I [[hope]] they'll continue to do their amazing work.
* [[2020.04.02 - TDL: 6 Letters in the C-Word, Gematria Calculates to 66]]
** I did alright here. I'm glad that my wife's head started feeling better. It's been great to see her have fewer migraines.
* [[2020.04.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: i...i just wish i consumed moar media...*BEEEEEEEP*]]
** Surprisingly brief. I can see myself curling back into some decent sleep too. Sick, breh.
* [[2020.04.02 - Prompted Introspection: Life Story Title]]
** My {[[Axioms]]} have been on the brain in [[prompt]]s. 
* [[2020.04.02 - Computer Musings: Revamp]]
** I have a lot more to do.
*** I'm also going to try to sit and wait for my offspring. It sucks, but I have to punish myself to teach them here.
* [[2020.04.02 â€“ h0p3ful Review: Thinking With Us]]
** I'm so grateful that my son takes it seriously.
* [[2020.03.05 - T-Money: Ignunt Know Nothing Me]]
** I wonder if he will find a way to confabulate his way to being a capitalist (and not just a reactionary).
** I'm so glad he's not going to be working for the US military, and I'm so glad he'll have more time with his family.
*** I think his family desperately needs it.
* [[2020.03.13 - T-Money: Kratom-Free]]
** Must be insanely hard for him. I assume he won't be able to maintain it, but I appreciate his effort. Would be interesting to see him build his life while clean, sober, and with less of an egoistic pursuit on the hedonic treadmill.
* [[2020.03.16 - T-Money: Invitation]]
** It's not easy to find advisors. I feel that pain.
** I think he often aims to discredit education to justify his immorality.
*** Not that his schooling was as well-rounded, directed, or applied as it could have been (but, I'd say the same for myself).
** It would be awesome to see him. 
*** I doubt we'd have much to talk about. =/
* [[2020.03.19 - T-Money: Transitions]]
** His problem is not with the unjustified suffering of the global poor. =/.
** We have different opinions on his ex-employer. He's not interested in the truth.
* [[2020.03.22 - T-Money: Stir Crazy]]
** I don't have much sympathy here.
* [[2020.03.26 - T-Money: Life Is Weird]]
** It must be difficult to hand me justifications.
* [[2020.03.29 - T-Money: Safety]]
** I would be impressed if he were actually attempting to give a shit about anyone other than himself (and even his family in virtue of himself).
* [[2020.03.11 - AIR: Reunited]]
** Edited. Including FB messaging. Q
** I'm so relieved and glad he's back. 
* [[2020.03.22 - AIR: Discord]]
** Signal is still the tool we end up using, but I want to make sure he can easily connect with folks. I still wildly prefer Signal.
*** Also, Signal's VC is stronger than Discord's with him. I do not know why. Cool.
* [[2020.03.29 - AIR: Remediable]]
** Does his keyboard censor swearwords? It's interesting.
** I'm trying to let him dictate the pace at which we communicate as best I can.
** I'm sad about the firepit gathering not working out. 
* [[2020.03.13 - gh057: VC Request]]
** He's been grinding. The man works hard.
* [[2020.03.19 - gh057: Closed School]]
** Hoarding and gouging are on the rise.
** I appreciate that I have the chance to talk about my anxiety with him. I don't have a lot of people who are willing to hear me there.
*** He pats me on my back and lets me know he hears me. He's a good man.
* [[2020.03.22 - gh057: Low-Key]]
** I want to get him high AF, lol. I don't know if that would be something he'd be interested in. We had a blast drunk. He's also got a wide-open view of the universe, so I think bliss would be just that for him.
* [[2020.03.25 - gh057: Enjoying Time Off]]
** [[gh057]] regularly does me the honor of asking how my family is doing. Aint a lot of people who give a shit. He does.
* [[2020.03.29 - gh057: Mowing]]
** Neither of us like to mow. Beer is what we have in common with KOTH.
* [[2020.03.04 - AA: A Little Overwhelm]]
** That sucks. I think her bio-mom's death is hitting.
* [[2020.03.13 - AA: Tech Noobs]]
** It reminds me of my wife's librarian co-workers who consider her a wizard with computers. Even their techs seem subpar to me. Hrm.
** Also, I am unhappy with the facepic post. =/
* [[2020.03.16 - AA: Introverts Ready For It]]
** It's interesting to see how her introversion protects her strongly. Not all introverts I know have done as well.
* [[2020.03.19 - AA: Ender's Shadow]]
** I don't know how I didn't see this before. I'm glad she brought it to my attention.
* [[2020.03.22 - AA: Different Dynamics]]
** Not a different story. We are good at repeating it at this point.
* [[2020.03.25 - AA: Blobtime]]
** They do have room for chickens. 
* [[2020.03.27 - AA: It's A Heating Pad]]
** I may have been misinterpreted, and I probably misunderstood.
** [[AA]] the Farmer. If she could put up with my insanity, I think we'd have fun designing farms.
* [[2020.03.29 - AA: Bigger & Fluffier]]
** I like how [[AG]] has to do something practical. I don't do this well enough for my own offspring.
* [[2020.03.12 - DeathOfRobinhood: Hunting]]
** I worry it was maybe smaller than what he wanted, but I do not understand well enough.
** Besides my own wedding, that is the only wedding I've ever been happy to attend. Not just happy. It was a privilege for me. I got to be the dude cheering him on! 
*** It's burned into my memory.
*** Selah is SO different from him too, but they balance each other. 
**** I have a feeling she would be super polite to me, but she would understandably not like me (even though she has infinite patience with those she serves). [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s tolerance of me is still surprising to me.  
***** That goes for [[chameleon]] too. She is exceptionally tolerant of me. Always cracking jokes, doesn't mind that I'm insane, chill. I'm very punchable, and it's not a problem.
* [[2020.04.02 - DeathOfRobinhood: Miyazaki Discerns What Is Truly Essential]]
** It is fascinating to see Miyazaki pick [[salience]] out. I assume he can see something I cannot. 
* [[2020.04.02 - DeathOfRobinhood: Insufficient Flailings]]
** Lol. He's hilarious in self-deprecation. [[kicks]] has the same ability too (with a dramatic brawling flair and humor). 
* [[2020.03.06 - GB: Serious Compliments]]
** I know how brilliant this man is. It is rare that I feel like someone is actually my peer. He obviously is. He hands me ridiculously high praise. I wish I could communicate how grateful I am to have learned from him. I don't think he believes me in some sense. He thinks he's just a sounding board. I've had to rethink my life because of him.
*** Sure, we disagree. =D. He can hear me giggle from across the wire when we hit metaethics. I care what he thinks.
* [[2020.03.20 - GB: Hopen]]
** I hate that our relationship will probably always be in small doses. 
** It kills me to see his family fall apart. I don't want to be a reminder or painful or useless. I wish I could hug him, but I think even that would be more pain, or so it feels? I don't know what to do for my man. He's in crisis, understandably so. 
*** You know what strikes me: when I'm in that much pain, I can barely muster politeness. I think he's better than he thinks he is.
* [[SODIS]]
** Glad I know it, and I don't predict I'll ever have to use it.
* [[Food Preservation]]
** Perhaps we need to start sooner. 
** I wish I had a memory like I used to...would be easier to spot deals.
* [[Pick Your Own Food]]
** We'll wait. This seems like a great plan though.
