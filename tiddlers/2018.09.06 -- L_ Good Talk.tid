 He’s much better at talking on the phone than I am. I think my generation has ruined me. XD

 if you can believe it, I think none of us feel comfortable one the phone; I think it's just a matter of practice

 I tell you one thing I still can't do is video chat
13 hours ago
 Maybe.
13 hours ago
 Oh?
13 hours ago
 It feels completely fake to me
13 hours ago
 I think I’m used to that at this point.

 Which sounds hilarious now that i think about it. XD

 But I feel more comfortable when I can see their face.
13 hours ago
 perhaps that is a practice thing as well

 Maybe? Part of my problem on the phone can be is that it’s hard to tell how someone feels about something unless they express it over the phone.

 Like they say “I am tired” or “That makes me sad” or whatever.

 At least with texting I can slap an emoji on the end so you know how I feel.
11 hours ago
 That is fascinating.

 I will need to think more about that. I think that contradicts a lot of arguments I've seen otherwise.
11 hours ago
 I trust your phenomenology, so now I'm left puzzled trying to understand it.

 I am also the type of person to rely heavily on emojis though. Or silly gifs.

 I want to make sure whoever is reading what I have to say understands my meaning and emotion as exactly as possible.
11 hours ago
 aye, and I would argue that speech has a higher bandwidth for communicating tone, emotion, etc.
11 hours ago
 I've regularly found text to be ambiguous, easily misinterpreted
11 hours ago
 Hmm... sometimes.
11 hours ago
 Perhaps I’ve learned to read in between the lines a bit?
11 hours ago
 I guess it depends largely on context.

 I love you =)
11 hours ago
 Haha, I love you too.

 Am I confusing the hell out of you yet?
