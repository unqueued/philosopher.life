title: 2019.04.24 - TDL: Dryer

* Dryer is broken again. Fuck me.
** I guess we diagnose and try again. It might just be cheaper (in so many ways) to get another one. So tired of the bullshit.
* Also, porch.
* Letter is slogging, but that's okay. 
** I feel like I have a ton to say to [[kicks]], but it has to wait. 
* We may have found a reasonable compromise on versioning.
* I want scaling ASCII Art markers, `|||x  foobar  |||x`
** I also want chatlogs with working links.
*** And a pony, and a cherry on top.
* Obviously, help all the children you can understand the world, homie.
