A quick and brutal fuck from behind usually served as an effective reminder of where you stood in the pack hierarchy.

What [our] early education produces in us is a sort of benign “user-illusion”—I call it the Cartesian Theater: the illusion that there is a place in our brains where the show goes on, towards which all perceptual “input” streams, and whence flow all “conscious intentions” to act and speak. I claim that other species—and human beings when they are newborn—simply are not beset by the illusion of the Cartesian Theater … In order to be conscious—in order to be the sort of thing it is like something to be—it is necessary to have a certain sort of informational organization that endows that thing with a wide set of cognitive powers (such as the powers of reflection and re-representation). This … is an organization that is swiftly achieved in one species, ours, and in no other.

-- Dennett

What seems to us most striking about our kind of consciousness is its self-reflexive nature. We can perform a series of actions and at the same time observe ourselves performing them, so to speak … This feeling of subjective consciousness is, of course, ‘What it is like to be a human’, and language contributes to it in a variety of ways. The most basic of these lies in providing the infrastructure for consciousness. You can't look at the spot you're standing on now if there is nowhere else for you to stand. A minimal prerequisite for self-consciousness is a place … from which a part of you can look at another part of you. The secondary representational system [of language] is such a place.

* Differentiationism, speciesism, Objective Realist teleological prioritization of perspectives (Platonic criticisms of [[OOO]]).

* [[The Hard Problem of Consciousness]]
* [[The Problem of Other Minds]]

* Epiphenomenalism

* It is, of course, widely known by many neuroscientists that "humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neural substrates."
** Just because we share a substrate in common doesn't mean animals have attributes like ours.

* Biological dependence of consciousness might point to necessary conditions but not necessarily sufficient conditions.

* What is animal? What about plants? What about the first piece(s) of life to which all other Earthly lifeforms are genetically related? Why not rocks? What does it mean to an object toward something, and how how ought we distinguish kinds of being toward something?

* Niceness vs Kindness

* Behaviorism takes qualia quite seriously, the metaphysics of [[The Hard Problem of Consciousness]] is not a subject which science can answer to some necessary [[dok]]. However, this is not to say such a view ought not define parameters and probabilities. 

* p-zombies

* Functionalism

* Dennett's claim that consciousness is an illusion.

* Examples:
** Elephants grieving dead
** Primates following game-theoretic conceptions of justice
** Birds singing and dancing to music
** Our own experiences with cats and dogs
** Dolphins, lawd
** The curiosity of the octopus

* Sapience vs Sentience
* Teleosemantics
** Intentionality, language requirements, making it explicit

* Dasein and [[The Moral Law]]

* Intellectual (cognitive or affective) disability

* Exploitation

* Duties to non-person objects. Are they in virtue of persons as object? 
** Lying to a dog: what kind of person do I want to be, even to a dog?

* Suffering
** Existential suffering vs. other kinds of suffering
** Utilitarian equations, priority
** Desire is not the same as rational intentionality
** Definitions of Reason
** [[gfwiwcgws]]

* Can a non-person be an end in itself? What kinds of objects (be the concrete or abstract) are merely instruments of dasein, or what it means find their value hypotheticalized or only virtue of objective ends, that is insofar as they can't serve as an end in themselves moreso than any other kind of perspective or object?

* Helplessness

* Are there perspectives which have moral priority? If so, what is the criterion?

* Many empiricists aim to discredit the meaning of qualia. Not, of course, there is a criterion for reasoning about how those qualia must be computed to some [[dok]]. Sufficient reasons for that qualia are outside the scope of spacetime: you have to do metaphysics to answer it.

* Is language necessary for conceptual thought?
** How explicit and present-at-hand [[SO]]ed must it be?

* Higher-orders of consciousness, lacking self-awareness, Franfurtian deepself autonomy, lacking reflectiveness (despite some perceptual consciousness), a self telling itself a story...

* Definitions:
** Animal consciousness, like human consciousness, is a state: a felt state -- a state that it feels like something to be in. It includes the quality or state of self-awareness within an animal: being aware of an external object or of something within itself. It is a key subject in the discussion of animal rights. In humans, consciousness has been defined as: sentience, awareness, subjectivity, qualia, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of self, and the executive control system of the mind. 

* Such an interesting problem for an autistic person. Our ability to develop theories of mind is impaired or just different in some crucial sense.

* I'm a libertarian freewill physical behaviorist. It's a particular kind of dualism specific to persons.
** Dualism here also points out Frege's Third World consideration. I don't get to say how metaphysics is divided up in so many cases. I do not get to say whether or not the mind is a separate metaphysical substance from Platonic abstract objects.


* Hume's analogical argument
* Descartes' differentations
* Dennett's intentional systems theory
* Functionalism
** Does it have to be common-sense?

* What does it mean to ask question in a non-anthropocentric manner?

* For my cats, I think they know how to push buttons, but they don't have a representative meaning like I do. They don't abstract their thoughts, question and empirically investigate semblances of things, metacognition of knowing the limits of what they know, the ability to both affectively and cognitively empathize (simulating and improving rich theories of mind) enough for [[The Golden Rule]], or tell themselves the extended consciousness autobiographical self-perception stories of who they are in a vivid and significant manner (which isn't to say they don't have memory or habits). Yes, they think. Even a baby thinks. I don't think babies are Daseinic though.
** Signaling is a kind of language, but not all languages can engage in at least classical logical reasoning (or more). 
** At best, I think my cats feel. Embedded in them are heuristics for reacting to environmental cues. They do have planning in some cases, but is it the kind of planning which is reflectively intentional?
** The language problems is non-trivial. I'll agree that any physical process can be described a language. What it means to use a language seems to require not just having a behavior in some mechanical way, but something richer.

* mirror test

* Drawing lines is hard

* Neural correlates and the black box

* Language can enable us to demonstrate that our thoughts are not about present particulars.
** Wordless concepts
** Self-representation allows one to think of one's self as an object.

* Xing oneself as Xing
** Knowing oneself as Knowing
** Perceiving oneself as Perceiving
** Concept of an "I" necessary for assessing one's own mental states.

* Should we really take up the Darwinian perspective that if a behavior's surface properties render it selectively advantageous, we can explain its origin and occurrence without reading any underlying mental events into it?
** Why must subjectivity be something which serves no objective purpose in an evolutionary sense?
*** Darwinian would ultimately reduce it all to an illusion.

* Epiphenomenalism
** Functionless side-effect of physical causes
** Why should we think it's evolutionarily parsimonious?
** Why should we think Morgan's Canon, even as corollary of Occam's Razor, solves this problem? We can't even define what is being caused.
** Correlation vs Causation in the relationship between conscious states and behavior.
** We do have to doubt our [[phenomenology]] here, but I still don't have overriding alethic (though I can give prudential) reasons to take up epiphenomenalism.
** It's hard to see the adaptive value of consciousness here. This puts the physicalist at risk, imho. Not open and shut though.
** Looking at it from a strictly nominimalist, physicalist, and non-dualist (as far as I can take it), I think it's pretty obvious that there's a causal relationship. The most conscious creatures clearly are the apex predators. It makes sense that egos dialectically grow. 

* Part of the issue with me is that I take [[The Hard Problem of Consciousness]] extremely seriously, paranoically. Certainty is something I've had to let go of a long time ago in many places. The POSR is also a classic I take up. Foundations here require accepting the regress.
