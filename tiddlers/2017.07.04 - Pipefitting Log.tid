It took two days to finish it, but I found bids for all the tools. This was harder than I thought. I was supposed to find all the tools from a single retailer for each bid list. After much searching, I found I couldn't. Only Amazon was capable of it. Thus, I had to combine retailers. I don't know if Johanna will find this acceptable or not. It took a while, and it will cost $1900 minimum for the tools. I didn't pick up the most expensive tools, but I did pick up quality tools. I want them to last for at least a few years minimum. I did pick up some tools which make the job easier, more precise, and make it go faster. `/fingers-crossed`, I hope AB&T will pick them up for me. This is beyond their usual. I'll call tomorrow to find out. What I don't want to see is Johanna badgering my employer in any respect about the list. We will see. 

I studied for the exam as well. I hope tomorrow will be the last day I go to school for a long time. I'm betting I'll have to stop by at least a couple more times to sort things out. Again, we will see. I don't feel prepared for the exam. I'm going to continue studying.

Brownies and alcohol for my teacher.
