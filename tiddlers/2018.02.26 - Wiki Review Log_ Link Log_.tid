title: 2018.02.26 - Wiki Review Log: Link Log?

* [[2018.02.25 - Family Log]]
** Taking the minutes.
* [[2018.02.25 - Link Log: Fuck Bloomberg]]
** Lol. I didn't get any further, sadly.
* [[2018.02.25 - Wiki Audit Log: Link Log Yearly]]
** OOPS, I forgot to write something here.
** I didn't really work on this sadly. =/ Ugh.
* [[2017 - Link Log]]
** I did nothing in it.
** I'm annoyed/going insane. I swear I did this log before. It was a monster! What happened to my work?<<ref "2020.02.27">>
* [[2018.02.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Squandering Money]]
** Edited.
* [[2018.02.25 - Wiki Review Log: Existential Wealth]]
** Have I finally learned my lesson? Or, is this really just the next stepping stone to becoming a decent admin of my system?
* [[2018.02.25 - Weekly Post-Mortem: Not Perfect, But Not Bad]]
** Aye. It was busy, and I felt like I rocked it.
* [[2018.02.25 - Weekly To-Do-List Log: Snowball!]]
** I'm wondering if I should just lay off the cannabliss entirely.
* //Decentralized Reddit//
** Long term, I very much like this idea.
* [[2018.02.25 - Computer Musings: Shreddit]]
** Love it. Shreddit is a good idea.
** They can always zoom in on 4k.
* [[2018.02.25 - Carpe Diem Log: Early to Bed]]
** Completed.
** I was exhausted. How is it that my wife doesn't have this ability to just sleep when she is so tired? I feel really bad for her. It's not fair. I need to ensure that she gets her sleep regularly and without interruption. How can I create a routine for our lives that maximizes that space of sleep for her?
* [[2018.02.25 - Daily To-Do-List Log: Famalamadingdong]]
** Didn't work on my boxes, nor did I get nearly as much writing done as I hoped I would.
* //2018.02.25 - Deep Reading Log: The Shining//
** Almost done.
