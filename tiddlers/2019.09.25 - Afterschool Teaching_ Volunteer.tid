title: 2019.09.25 - Afterschool Teaching: Volunteer

When I arrived, MadameM was waiting for me. She knew me by my homeless beard, lol. She's 6CM's sister, and she's here to help. She's studying child psych, and she just graduated from the high school. Her brother has begged her to come, and she's been in the program before. We talked about her aunt as being her rolemodel. It's wonderful to be able to praise one of my children so highly; I can see she's been a good sister to him. 

Prep was fast, and I did my best to talk while I worked. Whitney says the next program leader candidate (her friend) is just waiting on paperwork. We'll see.

One-on-ones were simple except I've a few fights to deal with. My children are also exceptionally inconsiderate with blueberries. 6KM scratched another boy, 6JR. We talked. My homeworkless geeks and I get to talk about books and life in a way that is just positive; they are also able to recognize and accept when we are rudely interrupted. My docile children need to learn to rebel wisely. 6CS is doing much better (percussion seems to have filled a hole in his life; he's happier, and I think the period of ideation is over for now).

We hit the library, and MadameM joined us. All but two boys crowded around her the entire time. =) I lightly teased her about it. She did a fine job talking with my kids. I think she was a bit shocked by how rough some of them are.

I picked up a lot of trash in the library today. It was messy before we got there. My knife fell out of my pocket, but MadameM picked it up for me. We love our brothers.

My children pushed the limits today in front of our guest, asking me to define a number of naughty swearwords. Shit, fuck, and pussy are super important words. I continue to give my speech on why we must inspect and understand the meanings of words which others say we aren't allowed to use in various contexts. MadameM was disturbed by my nonchalance about it, and I'm sure having graduated from the high school several months ago would make my reaction seem even more implausible.

Some tiffs were mediated. 5AO and 5CM discussed mierda and madre with me. These are some clever girls. Lots of discussion about swearwords today.

I was asked why I smile so much. It's so inappropriate, I know. I realize having an old man stroll around the room thinking to himself and talking with others is weird. Madman, ofc.

I was a bit surprised, but 6KM insisted I take a piece of gum from her. This was even after previously discussing scratching people with her earlier in the afternoon. 

Whitney sent me her lot, MadameM volunteered to maintain the library, so I took my children to the lab after a bunch hit the cafeteria waiting for the gym (it may not have happened).

6NW worked on her robot. It's slowly coming along. She's got a loosey-goosey process. I like that she writes about it.

Some of my students are spending time customzing their profiles on various silos. Plenty of vidya and youtubes as well. Their anime is different, and it's made for the youtubes.

6IK decided to say goodbye to me. I am surprised. Also, her glasses are missing. She said they are broken. I hope she can get a pair quickly here.

I adore that even my children who have phones don't want to leave because they know accessing the interwebs on a desktop is a different experience.
