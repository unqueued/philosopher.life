Called him. We thought this was done with. No such luck, sadly.

We talked for quite a while. My brother was easy going today, I think. His meds were there for him. 

He cautioned that [[Sharp Objects]] is going to get way, way darker. I can see a trajectory. I'm going to push into it. I appreciate the warning. My brother does not offer me shows, books, music, etc. lightly. He is clearly very thoughtful (selecting from his own selection). I'm very grateful that he curates on my behalf, and I aim to do him justice. I will be writing about the show as I watch it because I take his point of view seriously.

We talked about a game he plays with Raylan. Dinkin' Flicka Wisdom. Sending that young boy off right, lol.

We talked about my [[Wiki Audit: Remodeling]] and [[kickscondor]]'s unique tool. I'm still not fully understand what I'm doing. That's okay though!

Rebecca can only be happy with a baby, with our without my brother. He's scheduled two appointments to see a therapist. His union provides extra nice insurance on the matter too. He may decide to start writing in that case. 

He talked about being a pocket pussy apostle. He says he preaches it with ever fiber of his being, lol. Of course, I do the same with Tiddlywiki and writing to ourselves (though, I've advocated sex toys for men for quite a while). My brother's right that between your hand and sex itself, it's like 2/3rd of the way there. The costs and psychological factors are different. Admittedly, I adore being covered and welded together with my wife; skin hunger is strong in me.

We talked about standup. It's a similar thing possibly. Not everyone seems to adore it, imho. Men, for example, are the clear demographic winners (and performers). My brother believes he is only humorous to a small fraction of people, but I think that's normal. Others don't seem to be able to laugh about darkness or unconvention as much as he does. I know that feel.
