=) Lol. I can't help myself. She messaged me but not Delp. That's an odd move. Not a problem though. She must think I have power when I obviously do not.

I handled prep and the kids until Mitchell made his decision. He hand-picked students from 5th who needed to work on an assignment, and I took everyone else.

Delp and Mitchell were both concerned about Sonya coming today. In fact, Mitchell stayed later than usual to virtue signal. Matt came late, but he stayed in the office to also gladhand. I think I average more kid-hours than everyone else combined. That's fine with me too: that's what I'm here to do.

I gave my usual warnings to the kids about the fact that adults might see them on their phones. I usually have a number of people who aren't going to play while they are in the gym. I'm convinced I have an excuse, but they don't. I want to help them avoid getting into trouble here.

Delp can try to drive home the hierarchy with me, but if he really believed in justifying that hierarchy, he'd be listening to me, lol. He can be as pissed as he wants: it would be difficult to replace me, and further, I'm right.

The gym was good. I even played a bit, but I mostly wandered and talked with folks. I am that weird, bearded authority figure, so it's easier not to speak with me. It's usually the approval seekers or trolls. I will do my best to be useful to all of you.

Matt is in full smalltalk and ignore mode; cool. I, ofc, have continued the usual conversation trains. We did tangent into grading papers, but that shows another inequality that bothers him. After confirming he was actually going to be with us, I said I'd be taking students to the library. He decided to announce it for me; he does enjoy being in charge, lol. Herald for me; I will be with the books and the kids who want to talk and read.

The library was gorgeous. I had the usual bunch join me. 8GJ, 6HM, and 5:24f actually read. I don't just love them, I'm blessed to have the chance to effortlessly like them. I give them as much latitude as they ask for. I trust them. Their parents must work late.

My high school students seem to be screwing around with crafts (okay), but they have done me the favor of organizing and cleaning. Noice. The males tend to actually play in the gym with the kids, and I know the kids like that. Some of kiddos clearly look up to the highschoolers who have been through this program.

5NP threw a ball at my namesake, the smallest child there, out of anger. That is not the first time he has done this. That boy hated me before, but now he really hates me. The amount of lies and excuses were astounding. Funny enough, Delp thinks I'm not being nearly mean enough. 

Matt is taking next week off. I have no problem with that. My problem is the way in which Delp reasons with the rest of us about time off. I am dealing with a capitalist who gleefully manipulates the people around him.

I talked with the janitors for a while. Chill as fuck. They are my reprieve and sanity. We talked about the millennial issue. I made the case carefully, and we talked about the nature of power. We talked about a waterheater installation and piping. As usual, the janitors are the only adults in the building I respect or can tolerate without absurd anger (although, if they got to know me, that might change).
