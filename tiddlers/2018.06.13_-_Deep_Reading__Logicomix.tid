This was one of the best shitter-books I've ever read. I can't tell you how many times I sat and read 1 page and just sat here thinking about it. That's the sign of a good graphic novel folks. I could smash through the pages in 20 minutes, but this book won't let you (if you are paying attention). This book is a work of art, and we need more like it. There are number of complex philosophical topics that could be nicely broken down in historical context like this. 

Bravo.
