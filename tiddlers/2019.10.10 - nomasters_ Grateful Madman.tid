title: 2019.10.10 - nomasters: Grateful Madman

Hello, Sir nomasters:

Howdy! It's been too long. Thank you for [[reaching out to me|Contact]]. I'm a grateful madman, and I'm both pleased and honored to see you again in the desert.

Of note, it is possible you have been fairly quiet online for quite a while, like you've dropped off at least sections of the clearnet map.<<ref "i">> I would like to know why and perhaps how (even if you may have discussed aspects of it already), assuming you feel comfortable saying it out loud.<<ref "p">>

<<<
It's been almost a year since we last spoke, so I thought I'd reach out. How are you doing?
<<<

I regret to say: I still haven't picked up the book you've recommended beyond glancing through and reading the first few pages. It's just sitting there, pitifully. I [[hope]] you will forgive me.<<ref "u">> In general, among my other failures, I've done a poor job of [[reading|Deep Reading]] this year.<<ref "l">> 

My year has been fairly insane, a whirlwind of ups and downs, lots of blathering and dumping in my wiki, and I'm still attempting (poorly) to live my [[FTO]] {[[axiom]]}. Since we last spoke, I've been working in an [[Afterschool Teaching]] program, and I'd wager it suits this retarded jester. Even my feeble work in philosophy and [[naming]] has largely come to a halt as we try to survive. I'm trying to keep my head above water; even the world is drowning around me. The crisis borders on the surreal, and I'm doing what little I can with what little [[power]] I have to address it.<<ref "y">> //Yet//, despite the days growing darker, [[ridtyawtr]], life has been strangely [[good]].<<ref "d">> `/knocks on wood`, [[CTS]].

Recently, I've been burning some books for a simpleton's attempt at preachy art for the library nearby: [[Buxe & Braincandy]]. I've hollowed out my copy of Orwell's essays, and it will hold candy for the curious. I don't know what candy fits, so if you have any suggestions, I'm all ears. 

[[Family Time]] is still the highlight of my week. My son, [[1uxb0x]], and daughter, [[j3d1h]], have made significant progress this year. I work on the risk-assessed assumption (though not my prediction yet) I will lose contact with them forever in the coming decade, and I prepare them for a world I can barely imagine; it is a [[terrifying|E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]] time to be a [[father|Be A Good Dad]].

Despite being a hikikomori and a savage who belongs in a cave, I have been fortunate to venture out enough to see through the eyes of many [[gems]] in the desert.<<ref "n">> I walk and talk with myself often, pondering and interacting with [[kickscondor]], [[Sphygmus]], [[chameleon]], [[DeathOfRobinhood]], [[BDS97]],<<ref "m">> [[gh057]], [[JRE]], and [[K]], whose representations live both inside and outside me. I have been told I might be glacially starting a [[cult]] of [[Public Self-Modelers]]. We will see. Radical self-reflective honesty and empathy are sometimes extremely expensive.

How are you, sir? How's your family? Do you have any news from afar? What are your predictions? What has been [[salient]] to you? What are you worried about? What are you {[[dream]]}ing {[[about]]}? How are you spending your life? How are you doing?

I have a dumb question, but I can't [[help]] but wonder if we've serendipitously met the same person offline. Have you ever met a pentester and pirate who likes to race cars in Baton Rouge?<<ref "b">> He did not attend our alma mater, but none of our formal educations seemed to directly define our virtual [[love]] of computing. Curious, as always, sir. =)

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
