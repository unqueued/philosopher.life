Hello, fellow babbler. Well met! 

It is may not be meaningless, but it is false to say there is no [[Good]]. [[The Necessary]] cannot be rationally denied, and our affectation begs the question as well. Ideas are real, even without human minds; dialectics of concepts require the opposite obtains. I do not know what it means to say it sublates everything while agreeing to contingency.

Note, Saints GÃ¶del and Spinoza disagree with us. Gentle as they may be, I'm scared shitless to pick a fight with either of them. There is only the monadic, unified [[Good]] to them, everything else is an appearance, a mode, a leaf, an aspect, a perspective, a mistaken subjectivity. If it is, then so be it.
