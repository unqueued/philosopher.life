* [[Philosophy]]
** I've been very worried about this, and that's in part because I just have too much going on. There is a lot of chaos on this wiki. I try to control it, shape it, etc. Perhaps it is a losing battle. But, I hope that something emerges from the heap. However, I have to say, it went really smoothly. I'm cool with where it's at now. I simplified it considerably. I feel like I have a place I'm going again like I understand the path better. Perhaps I'm wrong, but that's okay. I'll keep doing my best.

** Well, folks, I just gave up, at least for now. There you go.
