!! Audit:

* It's been an almost DCK-less month. I can feel it.
* I don't wrestle with the concept of God much anymore, but I still wrestle with my invisible parents everyday in my head. 
** In time, I hope it will fade.
* My children have been doing poorly in their schoolwork. I don't know what to do. I live for my children, and it sucks to see them throw it away. 
* There were far fewer h0p3's logs this month than usual. They all had to do with my biological donors or my children.
