How are you today? I am so glad to be back at work! Routine is good for me‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
OCT 15 9:00 AM
Heck yes! =)
OCT 15 9:40 AM
I'm glad you are back into a routine here
OCT 15 9:40 AM
Yes I function better
OCT 15 9:40 AM
So I have been doing weight watchers with a friend‚Äîshe lost 5 lbs already and I gained over 3 ( sigh) however...since Saturday I think I have figured it out and am losing
OCT 15 9:42 AM
Who knew ‚Äúzero point‚Äù foods are not free....sigh
OCT 15 9:43 AM
That is one of my hardest mountains to climb.
OCT 15 9:43 AM
[[UJ]] and [[AG]] are trying to do it too
OCT 15 9:43 AM
Pure hell.
OCT 15 9:43 AM
It helps when everyone does it, I think.
OCT 15 9:43 AM
No food joy...
OCT 15 9:43 AM
No doubt. It is an important drug to me.
OCT 15 9:44 AM
I struggle with moderation of all things
OCT 15 9:44 AM
Aye. That is a super tricky problem in virtue theory. In folds in on itself.
OCT 15 9:46 AM
Its one of the reasons why I don‚Äôt drink, a little from time to time would be great but I don‚Äôt want to take the chance that I can ‚Äòt control it...like food...why start one more fight
OCT 15 9:46 AM
[[L]] is great at moderation‚Äîshe can say no easily to things. I am so glad she has this ability. I admire her for it
OCT 15 9:48 AM
You are both better at it than I am. 
OCT 15 9:48 AM
I dive headfirst.
OCT 15 9:48 AM
I would like to take credit but I think another thing that helps is my fear of eating or drinking new things...I am grateful for it too
OCT 15 9:50 AM
My routine is broken this week.
OCT 15 9:50 AM
Oh no...
OCT 15 9:50 AM
Oh, it's fine, not entirely broken*
OCT 15 9:50 AM
off the WoWcrack for a couple weeks now
OCT 15 9:50 AM
sleep normalized
OCT 15 9:51 AM
back to my writing
OCT 15 9:51 AM
Ah sometimes you have to do that
OCT 15 9:51 AM
No work this week, but homeschooling continues.
OCT 15 9:51 AM
[[k0sh3k]] is in CT today, should be flying back tonight.
OCT 15 9:52 AM
I have ffxiv to play and enjoy ‚Äîso tempting to stay up but at least [[K]] and [[L]] get off at a decent time most nights so that makes it easier for me to log too
OCT 15 9:53 AM
The hard problem with moderation is that sometimes the golden mean is actually all the way to the extreme. It depends on the context.
OCT 15 9:56 AM
What might normally be considered reckless in most circumstances is actually the disposition necessary for courage in another.
OCT 15 9:56 AM
Understanding
OCT 15 9:56 AM
How did [[k0sh3k]]‚Äôs Connecticut visit go?
OCT 15 9:57 AM
If moderation is a virtue, then what does it mean to take it to an extreme? You ought not be moderately moderate, but rather moderate with an exactness, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons.
OCT 15 9:57 AM
She's still on it.
OCT 15 9:57 AM
Having breakfast with the director now, I believe.
OCT 15 9:58 AM
Ahhh good! They will love her.
OCT 15 9:58 AM
Moderately moderate...oh my üôÑ I think I am in trouble
OCT 15 9:58 AM
Oh, me too, lol. 
OCT 15 10:00 AM
I get to go with Gpa for tests today.  Woot for cardiac testing! It is a shame that an 80 year old with a worn out heart valve can run faster and farther than his oldest grandkid
OCT 15 10:00 AM
I would not be shocked if he could outrun all of us in 100m sprint.
OCT 15 10:00 AM
How are [[AG]] and [[UJ]] enjoying their jobs?
OCT 15 10:02 AM
Aye he could out run all of us
OCT 15 10:03 AM
[[UJ]] still enjoys his job even though some days are difficult
OCT 15 10:03 AM
Oh, I bet. Must be intense.
OCT 15 10:03 AM
[[AG]] has decided that life in food service is not a long term career choice but it brings $ and she has to pay off her iphone 11 max pro that she couldn‚Äôt live without
OCT 15 10:04 AM
Haha. I hear that. I'm glad she has the opportunity.
OCT 15 10:05 AM
[[UJ]] has been recently flogged  with underwear by a naked 1st grader that I shall forever remember as ‚Äúmagic paxton‚Äù
OCT 15 10:06 AM
Reminds me that I should bug her. Haven't in a while.
OCT 15 10:06 AM
Wow.
OCT 15 10:06 AM
Lol
OCT 15 10:06 AM
Yes and she is doing better with keeping up with her phone since she is paying for it
OCT 15 10:06 AM

OCT 15 10:14 AM
[[UJ]] woke his Emmaus walk guys with the bagpipes on Saturday morning
OCT 15 10:15 AM
lol
OCT 15 10:15 AM
Full kilt ensemble
OCT 15 10:15 AM
It's an instrument you either love or hate, I think. Solid wakeup.
OCT 15 10:15 AM
Yep
OCT 15 10:15 AM
I like it in the distance....
OCT 15 10:16 AM
lol
OCT 15 10:16 AM
It has a nice echo to it
OCT 15 10:16 AM
Yep! He got a new Sporen (scottish man purse) to wear with his kilt at the Ren Fair that we went to with [[L]] and [[K]] on the 6th
OCT 15 10:18 AM
You have a good time?
OCT 15 10:18 AM
Yes! It was great fun
OCT 15 10:19 AM
Noice
OCT 15 10:19 AM
And I got to eat Scotch eggs ‚Äîthey make me happy
OCT 15 10:19 AM
Looks outstanding. Never had one before.
OCT 15 10:20 AM
They are soft boiled eggs covered in sausage and then bread crumbs and deep fried
OCT 15 10:22 AM
A small brick of yummy protein
OCT 15 10:22 AM
I have attempted to make them myself but they are a good amount of work
OCT 15 10:24 AM
They were delicious
OCT 15 10:24 AM
Aye, lots of layers.
OCT 15 10:25 AM
There are so many foods, but in the end, I'm too lazy to prep anything complex. 
OCT 15 10:26 AM
I want that low-hanging fruit.
OCT 15 10:26 AM
Yep ‚Äîthrow chicken in the oven to cook while napping. Nuke the sides when you get up hehe
OCT 15 10:33 AM
That is my go to
OCT 15 10:33 AM
And chicken is a zero point food!
OCT 15 10:33 AM
I assume you have to cut carbs
OCT 15 10:35 AM
Yeah somewhat
