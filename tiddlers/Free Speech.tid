title: Free Speech

Free thinking and free speech will often mean you don't believe anyone can own an idea, even if they can own specific material representations of it that follow the standard materialist Lockean path. Note, of course, that justification requires having acquired and used ideas appropriately, which is a virtualized kind of Hohfeldian ownership structure. We're conditioned to see the value of IP everywhere.

I want to worship on the altar of us holding an infrastructure upon which to build our [[Humanity]] so effectively that it mathematically guaranteed or radically increased the odds that anyone, even my enemy, will be heard and remembered wisely.
