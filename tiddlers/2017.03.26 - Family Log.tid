* How has our health been this week?
** 1uxb0x
*** Normal. Felt a bit sick one day this week, but taking a nap fixed it.
** j3d1h
*** Same as ever. 
** k0sh3k
*** Headaches for the past couple days, but have felt more energetic. Folate/B12 might be working. It would have "kicked in" this week. Might be placebo; we don't know yet. Stomach hurt all day yesterday. No idea what it was.
** h0p3
*** I'm feeling fatter this week. I slept well enough. My gut has had serious pain towards the very bottom a couple times. 

* What happened last week? Have you been happy this past week? Why or why not?
** 1uxb0x

**** Friend of his went on spring break, and he was planning to play with them, but they traveled.
