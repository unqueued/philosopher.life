title: ARAM: Sona

Sona is the undisputed queen of ARAM. She skips the laning and roaming phase of SR and just teamfights the entire time. More importantly, she gets to engage in the consistent war of attrition of ARAM, where she shines the most. She pokes, shields, and has an excellent ultimate. 

* Summoners
** Clarity - As usual, mana whore. It's about out-sustaining your opponents.

** Items
*** Start
**** Lost Chapter
**** Amplifying Tome
**** Health Potion
*** General Build
**** Morellonomicon - Given her ability to reach the highest CDR levels in the game due to her ult's passive ability, Sona is a true spam bot. This makes her, arguably, the most mana hungry champion in the game. Even if Morellonomicon only healed mana on kills/assists, it would be worth it. 
**** Ardent Censor - Play defense and work your way into offense. It is an item tailor made of Sona. It's literally perfect. The only reason Morello's is better is because mana regen, especially early, is just that important. 
**** Boots of Swiftness - You will be the primary target. You have to kite. Abuse the speed in your kit hard. Morello's is so strong that it's often better to go for it before boots.
**** Lich Bane - Sona also abuses this item better than the vast majority of casters because of her damage combo and spamming.
**** Luden's Echo - Excellent spam and speed
**** Rabadon's Deathcap - Make your shields amazing. Go Void staff if you are facing heavy magic resist. You can go Sorcerer's Shoes as well if necessary.
