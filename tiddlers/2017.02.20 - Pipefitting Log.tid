title: 2017.02.20 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a good day. I was pumped to get back into the shop and fucking do something. I think I was agitated by being off my schedule last week.<<ref "2020.02.21-1">> I look forward to my time working on stuff.<<ref "1">>

My teacher asked me if it was checked. I said yes, even though we didn't do a final check (because I was continually unsatisfied with it). I honestly think that's the answer he wants from me, so I'm giving it to him. It's clear he cannot help me fix the problem, and I don't want to make him feel bad about it. That's just not useful to our relationship. The truth is powerless to our relationship in some ways. It is not the kind of socialization I'm innately comfortable with, but I think it is actually the kind and empathic thing to do in his eyes. I do it knowing the weight of what it means to do this, and I take it very seriously.<<ref "2020.02.21-2">>

In a weird way, I fear I treat him like my cat. I adore my cats. I honestly want the best for these psychopathic bastards (cat psychology is fucking hilarious). To different extents, my cats are not smart enough to understand me or my intentions. Golden Ruling my cats is odd. That Ranga is now inside with us permanently I take to be the option most likely to maximize his happiness. I must imprison him, and I wish I could explain it to him. I wish I didn't have to imprison him, and instead wish he could see the reason he must stay inside with us.<<ref "2020.02.21-3">> I wish I could convince him. But, I can't. It's not up to me. I think I am doing something similar in being what I hope is morally virtuously deceptive. It's perhaps a kind of white lie. It seemed to be asked for, and so I gave it. If I cannot give a cost-benefit analysis reason, a frontal lobes answer, then I need to be willing to change. I think it has a prudence to it for both of us. 

It's weird kind of application of the golden rule to not "treat them as you would want to be treated" in the most rational sense, but instead to "treat them as they say they want to be treated " (another interpretation, of course, an empathizing of their position itself in the deepest, even if less rational, sense) even if they don't understand the logical consequences of the thing they ask for. Inequalities in knowledge and theories of mind create very difficult power dynamics and ethical dilemmas. It's much easier to do ethics in something like that proverbial physics' vacuum. When we treat people as being as rational as we are, we can come up with very impractical, often lower utility, and perhaps worse outcomes. I suspect I am terrible at this golden rule problem, or at least come up with non-typical answers in some respects, because I'm autistic.<<ref "2020.02.21-4">> My rTPJ really does activate abnormally. 

Okay, that was a detour.<<ref "2020.02.21-5">> Anyways, he was fine with my answer. Nash and I took it apart quickly, and he gave us our new bookwork. He didn't even make copies, he just gave us his original this time (we were careful with it). By 9:00 I had finished the highlights, chapter, and going over his specified material. Nash will happily avoid bookwork like the plague. I'm not sure how much this affects me. I just need all 3 books finished by October if I can. That is reasonably accomplishable at the pace I'm moving. So, Connor was picked to help us learn the next type of task.<<ref "2020.02.21-6">>

We are building X-piece-90's. They are basically circles fragmented into pipe-line-segments which are tacked and welded together. We made a 3-piece-90 today. Connor walked us through the steps of making lines cardinal sides, and the teacher came by to tell us how to do the math (since Connor didn't know how). I ended up doing the math,<<ref "2020.02.21-7">> and we drew slices equal to the center-to-center measurements of the pieces we were going to cut. Then, we found the right miter cut size from the book and drew those on. We used a bandsaw blade as a "straight-edge" to use our sharpie on the pipe.<<ref "2020.02.21-8">> It had to curve around not just the pipe, but was also angled; it wasn't a vertical, perpendicular to the horizontal laying pipe cut. We did not mark as carefully as we should have. And, it showed. 

We went to cut it with a bandsaw. Mine was excellent! =) Yay. Good enough that Connor didn't think we even needed to grind it. He says that the way he tries to make all his cuts (since it limits the work he's aiming for). We did our best on the cuts though. It was our first time. Nash kinda messed his up. He was on cold medicine all day, so he wasn't really there.<<ref "2020.02.21-9">> Basically, I ended up doing the grinding work to fix his mistake. That's fine though. It was good practice. I'll take every ounce of practice I can get. 

I'm still unclear on the absolute best strategies and tactics for grinding. I'm finding my own tricks at this point. I understand the miter cut needs to be 22.5 degrees (for the 3-piece-90), and it needs to be as straight as fucking possible (seals are clearly sexy). I grind down to make it straight (they should be flush when joined). I also must grind to make sure that when I join the pieces, I get a 45-degree angle from my level. 

One of the better students, TJ, recommends leaving a bit of extra space for grinding at all times. I parroted back his justification succinctly: You can cut more pipe away, but you can't simply add more pipe. This hedging principle has shown up many times, and I consider it a variant of measure twice, cut once, or at least in the same family of reasoning. He is correct about this. Giving myself just a hair of breathing room allows for me to hide mistakes in my cuts, it gives me options, it lowers the risk, etc. It has to be accounted for in the measuring and line drawing though. Just a 32nd or 16th of an inch extra would be nice. It's very easy to grind the whole thing equally (you just rotate around with the grinder). Getting out unevenness, however, is much harder. There's some eyeballin' to do, I tell ya' h'what. I will develop good eyes for grinding, beveling, and cutting. Artists must be accomplished at drawing straight lines, and I'm sure every pipefitter can do this in their sleep. This is crucial to making pipes "fit" together. Do the math, and make the right cuts. This is a virtue theoretic aspect of the practice, imho. The cleanliness of it, the speed with which you can do it, the efficiency, the risk-limitation factors you impose, etc. 

Anyways, to our teacher's apparent displeasure, all the guys started joining in on our project (instead of working on their own). I think they found it interesting. Keaton came by to tack weld it (since Connor trusts Keaton more than himself?). I held the pieces together (if Keaton fucked up, I swear it could really burn me badly; I do not care for needing to trust people with my hands in this respect). That reminds me, I will be wearing my true welder's gloves for welding from now on, especially when someone else is welding. So, anyways, Keaton tacked one side. We adjusted a bit, flipped it, and he went for the second tack on the other side (you do the sides instead of top and bottom to give you a chance to bend for the 90, and if necessary cut out segments, if you aren't exactly 90 that is). This time, he made a hole in the join. 

Apparently, Connor and Keaton had the heat way too high on the welder. It should have been at around 50amps, although my teacher says it varies with the welder (he said they had it way too high and should have known better). They brought in another student to fix it (since he boasts that he can, and they enjoy taking him a down a peg or two). An aspie if I ever met one, Ferguson; he's cool and kind. They make a lot of fun of him; they are mean to his face. It's gross. I go out of my way to be kind to him as a reaction to these facts. Anyways, he couldn't seal the hole (since the heat was still way too high). He made it much worse. We laughed about the giant hole in my project, but then they started to blame him (and he was just trying to fix their error). The teacher said Ferguson isn't a bad welder, even if he isn't smart. Ferguson was practical. He grabbed a piece of metal, cut off a triangle, and patched the pipe. I ended up grinding a ton off it. The teacher, of course, immediately knew it was all kinds of messed up when he saw it. My teacher said I should have come to him for the welding part (but he was the one who put Connor in charge). It was messy, but it worked. Our next welds were done by Keaton on the MIG. These were clean (although, it spits way more). 

They made fun of Ferguson for sharpening his knives a few weeks back, acting like he was too stupid to do it. I have no idea why he puts up with it or engages them in it (he really thinks they are his friends, I fear). Ferguson has a very nice kit, and he treats his knives gently. He cares about his things. His moccasins (comfort), humor, his truck, his mom, and his work (he is passionate, even if he sucks at some things; can't pass a test to save his life, I tell you that).<<ref "2020.02.21-10">> I wanted to thank him for putting up with the bullshit, so I kindly asked him publically if he would be willing to sharpen my knife. They looked at him differently after that. They decided he could sharpen knives now because I thought he could. I had some knife work I had to do today anyways, and turns out, it really was sharper this second time around. Ferguson knew a surprising amount about my knife. He even knew where I got it, had tried them before, etc. I like Ferguson. He's weird but good. 

During break (which I rarely take when I have work I can do in the shop, but I was at the mercy of others here), Keith explained how he got in trouble with our teacher (but is expected by his pipefitting bosses to perform) for shortcuts.<<ref "2020.02.21-11">> Keith acts like it know it all, which miffs my teacher clearly. They butt heads a lot. I have heard Keith speak (he does love to talk). Existentially, he's stupid about many things. However, I have heard him speak about computers, and he is at least cautious in his choices of displaying knowledge there. When it comes to pipefitting, much of what he says seems rational to me. I do it the long way (since I have no need to cross my teacher), but I keep these shortcuts in my pocket. I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to have a machine rotate a pipe while beveling? That seems like a way to make a very consistent bevel, like a potter on a potter's wheel.

Magically, it ended up being the correct radius and dead on 90. It looked like shit from the first two welds and the patch. The lines were off. I could even see the pipes' circumferences didn't really line up as cleanly as I'd have liked. Connor said it was good enough to take to the teacher. So, we did. I explained that I knew the lines were off and that the pipes were lined up as well as I'd have liked, but that it had the correct radius and angles. We checked. He said it fine. He told me to do the same thing for a 6-inch radius.

It was late when we started on the next project. The teacher also told me he was going to have the guys clean the area we were using. Basically, we didn't get much done on the second project of the day. I'm excited to do all of it (with Nash) tomorrow. I want to do it without help this time. 

I must admit that I'm confused that my teacher didn't just show me how to do it from the beginning. He tends to have students teach students when possible. This can be a good thing, but it can also be lazily abused. I see a mix in him. I was always happy to hear his thoughts, advice, and objections to our work or process. He did come by. Sometimes not at the right times, but he did come by to give us his input. We needed it. Perhaps he knows we need to time to jump around in the mud puddle? I don't know. I will think about it.

This is relevant in the sense that I will have to teach the incoming student, I believe. The teacher says he has to catch up to us, which is 1.5 months of hard work. I'm going to be babysitting. I'm going to be held back by this person (and I thought Nash was an ankle-dragger!).

Oh, one of the students got arrested the other night. Lol. They read a publication that shows who went to jail every month like a gossip magazine. There are rougher kids here. I can only help them with their computers and be kind, oh, and learn from them when I can.

I still haven't drawn plans for the simulator either. I may do that when I can't find work to do. I need to get measurements first. I'll have Nash help me do that tomorrow. He can spare me the 10 minutes.
