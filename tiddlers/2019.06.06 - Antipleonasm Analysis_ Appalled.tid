title: 2019.06.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Appalled

!! Respond to the following gem:

I think we can be reasonably confident that if the American population had the slightest idea of what is being done in their name, they would be utterly appalled.

That would be a helluva an education for us all. It would be radical culture shock, induce postmodern despair, call into question who we were, and I suspect cause mass upheaval. It would be [[good]] for the world. 

Almost no Americans have a fucking clue what abject poverty looks like, and that includes me (despite my work in Thailand). Our violence is incomprehensible, and to understand even a clean reduction of capitalism as a hyperobject is almost unfathomable. I know I've only seen images and videos of the fucking eyebleach atrocities we commit around the world. I've read stories, and I've met people who are slaves. I can't see it; I don't want to see it. Experiential knowledge is still beyond me. I'm not sure I could bear to live through it. Appalled isn't even the word. I think it would destroy me to know it.
