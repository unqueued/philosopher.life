title: 2020.03.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Grind

* Woke at 11:15
** Groggy AF.
* Offspring were at work. Delightful.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Dialectures
* Called [[JRE]], [[Charlie]], [[MB]]
* [[MB]] 
** She's doing alright. Hubby has no work, but he's hunting for outs.
** She's knitting again. (k)Nifty.
** Thinking about people in our lives.
** Overall, no news is good news.
* Laundry
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** He's walking the baby. Got two different routes he takes, one that hits the store.
** Told him about that feeling.
*** Interesting misunderstanding. He saw two interpretations, one about the world and one about taking my life. He did a good job of pulling back to ask for clarification.
** He's feeling like he has pressureless time alone now that everyone is home.
*** I think he's adjusting.
** Said he'd call back. He's super busy though.
* Daughter's doctor appointment is now teleconferenced?
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** My daughter cracks me up. Neat to see some [[gems]] too.
* Send offspring to meet the neighbor kids outside
* Dialectures
* Inform the Men!
** Pure animal
* Meditation
* Walk with wife
** Just around the neighborhood.
** Got to the top of the hill behind our place and saw our son watching the Youtubes. 
*** Pinecones were thrown until he turned around.
* Scrounged
** Salad, sausage
* [[Magic]] with [[1uxb0x]] + [[j3d1h]] simultaneously
** [[1uxb0x]]'s MWC vs Goblins. Lackey->SGC, but Ith, Elspeth, and Pulse almost lock me out. I won the turn before Austere Command by saccing into pulse, barely squeaking it out. A single wrath would have been autoloss, but I lucked out.
*** Adore how he understands the necessity of forcing me to overextend.
**** He smiled on his first pulse, and I shouted "FUCK!" He just laughed his ass off.
** [[j3d1h]]'s Affinity vs UR Delver Sligh, +2 turns my favor. Blue-screwed, and she has solid nuts. She misses Disciple triggers and fails to sac correctly (though does play around lavamancer well) against PoP. She had it, but missteps.
** [[1uxb0x]]'s MWC vs Turbofog, +1 turn his favor. Early Elspeth, Austere Command and O-Rings, but eventually I topdecked the Chant and locked him out. Should have given him way more turns. 
** [[j3d1h]]'s Affinity vs Karakasless D&T, +2 turns my favor. Unfortunately for her, I drew a godhand. Mystic, Jitte, Batterskull, 2x MoR, Vial, and other goods puked into play. Complete destruction of her manabase on top of jitting the fuck out of her board. Fair bet, but the draw was nuts. She had not scalars at all either.
* Listened to my wife speak with [[CH]]
* Upon Request, we went through public school packets.
