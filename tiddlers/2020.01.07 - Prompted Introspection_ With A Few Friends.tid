title: 2020.01.07 - Prompted Introspection: With A Few Friends

!! How do you have the most fun?alone, with a large group, with a few friends?and why?

Fun is the wrong word, right? Or, is this about how I "do" or "would," and under what circumstances? I think you are asking me about preference here. But, even that misses the point, since my own preferences are lacking. Clearly, fun is not enough. Although I'm never going to fill the void, quell all despair, complete myself, or achieve perfectly ideal eudaimonia, my hedonic pleasure cannot be [[The End]]. 

I need friends of many [[dok]], but the spirit of the answer: with a few friends. I'm alone enough as it is. I'm a social creature, even if I suck at it. Friendship requires a kind of work, and compatibility is rare for me.

I feel like an extrovert forced into introversion given my context. There are possible worlds in which I would be surrounded by people I like all the time, and I would enjoy larger groups more often. Most encounters I have with people feel shallow and fake. It's so expensive to even attempt to build rich friendships with depth (including profound spaces where I feel safe and happy for you to call me your favorite faggot), and it can feel pretty [[hope]]less in a crowd which tends to be playing mere signaling games for the sake of egoistic vampiric pyramid climbing in the will to power.

What I find interesting is often not what other people find interesting or valuable, and that makes it exceptionally difficult to connect. Sometimes that is a malicious problem, but so often it isn't. This is one thing I like about the internet: it's easier to find the extremes.
