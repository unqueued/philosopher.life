title: 2019.12.13 - Prompted Introspection: Birfday Feelin'

!! How do you feel when it's your birthday? Why?

The past few birthdays have been solid. I feel lucky to be with muh fam, eating food I like, sex, and having a cleaner house. I don't feel older, but I have more opportunity to think about the fact that I'm older. It's like New Years for me; it's a marker and almost a ritual in my life. I can't say I'm terribly reflective on my birthdays though.
