Thatâ€™s some serious wow, how did you set it up?

I would love to do something like this but have no idea where to begin.

A wiki journal wow, right now I just use writer, the internet typewriter.

Thank you. I'm glad you find it interesting. 

It's a [[Tiddlywiki|https://https://tiddlywiki.com/]] I started ~3 years ago. My development environment is currently built on [[Bob|https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-Bob]], but the primary distribution method to others is through gitpages from which I deliver the entire wiki as a single, cryptographically signed html file.<<ref "s">> I use [[a script|wiki-live-git.sh]] to sign and upload changes on a minutely basis, but previously I used Resilio Sync across my devices (including the webserver). You can find the history of growth of the setup in [[Computer Musings]] and [[Wiki Audit]]. The current infrastructure is basically outlined in [[RGM]]. The way I use and set up my wiki seems to constantly evolve; TW is well-designed for transforming itself.

It's easy to have up and running in 15 minutes. The learning curve is not too steep (my offspring are picking it up fast), but there is plenty to learn if you want. I don't really do anything too fancy in my wiki compared to what I've seen from others; vanilla tiddlywiki usage is very easy. Make sure you keep backups/snapshots, and any of the methods will work well. I very much like the single-file mode (PMario's FF addon does the trick), but it is not the correct mode for me anymore. Tell me your OS, and I'll help you make one too. The documentation is sufficient, and the communities on [[Google Groups|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywiki]] and [[Discord|https://discordapp.com/invite/wncV2z5]] are extremely helpful (don't be shy as a noob).

I've never found another tool like it. I use it to speak with [[myself|h0p3]], my [[family|Family Time]], and [[others]].
