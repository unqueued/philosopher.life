That is an outstanding strawman. I agree that all moral rights concerning objects (excepting [[The Good]]) in the physical universe can be described in terms of moral Hohfeldian property rights molecules. I'm fine calling moral rights "property rights." Some socialists will talk about the difference between personal and private property rights. I'd prefer to think that Rand simply doesn't know which property rights are valid. I'm a unification theorist as far as I can go: there are only moral rights. No other normativity matters to us. I'm a normativity-monist cosmopolitan.

No, Rand, our disagreement is about the metaphysics of morals which compute the principles of justice used to determine (and enable us to [[fff]]ingly engage in the heuristical intersubjective determination of) the particularization of the decentralized basic structures and fitting distributions of Hohfeldian property rights in each society's context in the material dialectic. That is where you have no grounds, and you want to misdirect us with your strawman. [[The Golden Rule]] is not simple, but it clearly doesn't justify your opinion, let alone your manipulative rhetoric.
