Preach, yo!

This book is already saying what I believe, confirming my bias. I fucking hate neo-liberalism. I lived in NO. There are several reasons we homeschool, and NOLA only strengthened our resolve on the matter.

Take event X, throw "Capitalism" on it, and you've got a non-trivial hypothesis to question. The analogy of psychological shock torture brainwashing attempt is not ridiculous, although I'm not sure how clean an analogy it is in the end.

This is one of those books that has shaped the conversation I've been immersed in, and I've seen it cited and applied many times. It might not say anything new, but I'm still interested in making sure I've experienced it.

It appears this is also an argument against Accelerationism, Revolutionary approaches to Socialism. Unfortunately, I think overthrowing our masters isn't going to be pretty. It's going to be bloody. Ultimately, I fear this is also reaction status-quo defense, crazy as that may sound to most. Of course, I see the usual //tabula rasa// problematics.

I think Gail and I have something in common. This is kind of crazy, eh? =)

Listening to this is making me truly angry at my donor-exploiters. This is completely fucking obvious. I know they could make these inferences if they wanted to.

The patterning/depatterning, hilariously, reminds me of the Nozickian argument against patterned theories of justice.

I know a lot of people who would call this conspiracy theorist, but at some point, I think any organization/coordination narrative which doesn't fit into their reality map will just be called a conspiracy theory. It's fascinating to see the religion of economics disperse into politics and military-industrial-complex so clearly in this book. It's well done.

I think I'm far left of Naomi.

I'm 60% of the way through the book, and I'm done with it. I'm not learning what I didn't already know, suspect, or assume, at least in the broad strokes. The journalistic approach, of course, is something I appreciate. She's preachin' to the choir here, of course.
