You doing alright?

Uh oh, you sick?

This monday, boss started the safety meeting saying he needs all hands on deck for the wire pulls coming up, lots of overtime,  and holiday time off needs to come to a close.  About  2 hours later I told him I can only do 10 hour days for one more week, since it forces rebecca to leave work early.  He sighed and said thanks for the heads up.

So.... we'll see how much longer I'm here this weekend.
Jan 9 7:13pm
I hate working 10s, but the transition from 10 to 8s is awesome.
Jan 9 7:13pm
Has your stuff gotten there yet?
Jan 9 7:16pm
Aye, I've been sick for several days. Having a hard time getting everything done, but we at least got everything out of the pods and into the house.

Hopefully, the boss will let it slide. I have no idea.
