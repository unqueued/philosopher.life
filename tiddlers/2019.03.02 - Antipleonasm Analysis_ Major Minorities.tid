Remember also that the largest majority on earth is the collective. Those who deny collective rights, cannot claim to be defenders of the majority.

Even if you think collective Hohfeldian rights can be reduced to complex molecules (and bodies) of individual Hohfeldian rights, to deny collective rights is to deny we can all share a set of individual rights as well.

Rand, you defend the centralization of power, the elite of power (rather than truth) in the human pyramid, and hence the pyramid. My point to you isn't that hierarchy is conceptually wrong (that requires normativity, a hierarchy, to even attempt), but that the hierarchy in place (the one you helped create) is wrong. You defend the minority of power. You have no interest in talking about what we all owe to each other, the minorities in all cases, a collective of minorities; you are only interested in securing the interests of powerful minorities.<<ref "m">> I aim to justifiably give voice to the silenced.

Obviously, I agree that balancing individual and collective rights is crucial. Collectives and individuals are wrong all the time; justification can only ever partially be calculated by collectives. We all think we are right (or wrong for the right reasons), but some people are closer to what is objectively right than others. How do you get a species to listen to the virtuous minority [[irwartfrr]]? From what I can tell, radically decentralize power structures via [[T42T]] and start spending yourself, your identity, your trust, your social capital, your voting in [[The Original Position]] quadratically. Show that you sacrifice from duty for something more important than yourself.

I do not claim we will succeed. My prediction is against our survival and moral integrity. The [[4DID]] of [[Humanity]] is going to be squeezed to death.
