//I'm thinking outloud. This isn't even a draft (it would not be charitable to quote me yet, imho), but you can think about it.//

I was a high school teacher in the states, and I taught all age ranges in Thailand in private schools. I taught university classes for several years. I've been a piano teacher, and I used to teach biblical studies and theology classes when I was Christian. I legitimately enjoy teaching. I think it's a noble profession. I can't say I'm good at it, but I've had some practice. Let me also admit that my autism may also be a perceptual distortion here (although, I think it can lend me outsider clarity as well). 

I've also homeschooled my daughter (12) and son (10) from the beginning because I think they deserve radically better than any school available to them. Imho, I'm not a particularly good teacher, but I am passionate about many subjects (and competent in a couple). I also believe other children can receive an education like what my children have received. I happen to think schools can be revolutionized, but I think the same about society in general (although, this isn't my prediction).

Alright, so that's where I'm coming from; may it serve as context, caveat, and give shape to the source of my opinion. I realize there are mountains of concerns here; I can only give you my gut instinct.

Chromebooks are the new fashion in elementary school. They are cheap; they are everywhere. And they are unusable by kids in kindergarten through, in some case, third grade.

I've bought a lot of budget computers for my children over the years. I'm only now just able to begin trusting them with more expensive hardware.<<ref "h">>

* A junky PC in Thailand to play with since they were 1 and 3. 
* Wii
* PC from cannibalized parts from a friend
* The first $50 tablets that came out (many years ago).
* Used smartphones since Moto Droid
* 


Some appear to have been more useful than others. 

I bought Acer C720s at $150 a piece something like 4-5 years ago (they were subsidized hardware at the time). We modded them and tweaked Xubuntu to make it work (no GalliumOS at the time). These were their first laptops, but they had ridiculously budget tablets and older phones as well. They also had a multi-seated desktop. I've done what I could with what I had to help them become digital natives.

The Chromebooks were not unusable. They weren't a great fit though. I'm glad they used them. It turned out to be a good thing to expose it to them. They were perfectly comfortable in the browser (my children started typing at 5). Minecraft was a wonderful way to get them to care about their computers in a bunch of ways. Getting them to be real users wasn't so bad; getting them to be their own admins has been fairly difficult.

Windows was easier; Linux has been far more rewarding.

Sure, by now children can do some rudimentary typing and mouse flicking. But if you think trackpads are awful for adults, you should observe children using them. Tears, people.

I like thisâ€”from an abstract I saw recently:

<<footnotes "h" "Interesting thing to my eyes is how much more trust I have in their use of software. This may just be a result of being poor; software is just cheaper to fix in many cases. At this point, my daughter has done plenty of root work on my own machines for a while now. I hand off system admin work around the house to her often. I trust her not to break my software far more than my hardware. She would not be allowed to open [[monster-10]]. She also has way, way less practice working on hardware. I can barely convince her to open her own desktop to add a drive.">>
