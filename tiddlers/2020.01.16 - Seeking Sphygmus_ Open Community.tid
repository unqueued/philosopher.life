Preach, yo!

<<<
there isn't any direction anymore, and the questions are "what do you want?" but I don't know what I want I've never really thought about what I want have I or what it means to want something or what that feels like because it's not been about what I want it's been about
<<<

Terrifying. Not easy to know how we ought to spend our freedom, ourselves. 

<<<
I don't know how to make friends in the offline world.
<<<

Feels like it only gets harder with age too. Maybe not the 'just being there together' part, but having people who understand your story beyond the surface becomes a more difficult task over time.

<<<
having rooms all next to each other, leaving your door open if you were open to chatting or just wanted to be open to knowing what other people were up to by hearing or taking a walk down to the water fountain to see if anyone else had their door open.

That had to be one of the best parts of college. =). Totally miss that. It varied between dorms for me (my last dorm before moving in with [[k0sh3k]] was perfectly set up for doing this, but everyone was more interested in their privacy). It's so fucking hard to reproduce it, as you point out. Even to this day, [[Tasha]] felt it necessary to text me in advance that she or they were coming over from next door. In New Orleans, only [[MB]]&A would just show up, unannounced, and walk right in (we don't lock our doors).<<ref "i">>

I grew up in the countryside. People tend to be nice to kids, even artificially, so my nostalgia may be all sorts of wrong. I remember lots of people left their car keys in their car in case someone needed to move or use the vehicle. Some people left their doors unlocked while they were away so a visitor could just walk in and make themselves at home until they came back (though I remember those who answered the door with a shotgun, and even some you had to honk from your vehicle before getting out and walking toward the house...fascinating range). Going over to someone's home to bug them, shoot the shit, etc. cost less social capital (if it was a social cost at all). We weren't as compartmentalized, alienated from each other, locked into isolation by norms. 

Openness is expensive. It's easier to do when you take everyone in your vicinity to have a right to your time, if you trust people, if you see people as your equals (beyond a Libertarian sense of non-interference), and when you don't have the pressures of capitalism alienating you from your time. Aint nobody got time for spontaneous block party, sadly.

<<<
how might you design a community that is different?
<<<

Contemplative/intentional living, cohousing communities, communes? Gotta find like-minded people. It's not all up to you. The trust necessary for openness takes so much time (or shared enemies, trauma, energy investments) too, imho. 

<<<
I don't fucking know if I'll ever have anything like it again.
<<<

I don't know. Probably not. =(. Closing the distance is fucking hard. Maybe short-term relationships, and those based exclusively on shared interests aren't so hard to find, but generalized and long-term friendships (especially the sacrificial kind) don't seem to have a place. People get used to it, I think. Like, that's the new normal, why strive for more? 

It's insidious, god damnit. Knitting and weaving ourselves together is all we have.
