title: Outopos: Agnosticism

Outopos needs to be as hardware, platform, OS, and language agnostic as possible. The goal is to build a tool which can go everywhere. The [[Atropos]] protocol needs to available in:

* C
* Rust
* Python
* Javascript
* Go

I consider these to be the dominant languages for Outopos.
