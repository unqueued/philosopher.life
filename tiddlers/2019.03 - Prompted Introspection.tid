!! Audit:

* I'm not just talking to myself in here.
** However, I'm not sure who I'm talking to always either.
*** It doesn't seem like I speak to my usual interlocutors much this month.
* I don't know what I'm doing in my second attempts at responses, but I like it. 
** I kind of need to figure out what's happening to eventually shape the list into something crystallized.
** I branch and rabbithole. I go off topic plenty.
* I see more of my family in here, I think.
* Some of these are incredibly brief. There are more errors as well.
** This is an outgrowth of answering them on my phone while at work.
* Serious {[[Vault]]} material in here.
* I am less moved by this section than usual too, but I'm glad I did it.
** I might be feeling that in general too.
*** Keep going.
