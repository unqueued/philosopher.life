!! Audit:

* I can clearly see my anxiety about [[Wiki Audit Log]]
* Interesting tidbits are caught up in this log.
* Thankfully minimal interaction, even indirectly, with my donors. It did affect me.
* I did a lot of grinding this month. I clearly felt overwhelmed at times too.
* I'm glad that I see when I'm discouraged and call myself on it. I'm more gentle here.
* Triage, triage, triage! Triage infinigress.
* I say "slowly" or "it's coming together" or other ways of telling myself that it is cultivating. That is encouragement.
* I've clearly decided my children must engage in this. It's incredibly useful.
* I saw my expectations for myself and my children adjust over the course of month.
* A great deal of shape has been given to this wiki this month.
* I really like having gutteral responses to work with. It's clear there was a lot of spending and recovering this month.
* Lots of one-word answers. 
* Ditto
* Money and information anxiety. This will be my last month of working on this. I need to make it count.
* The titles tend to be strong in themselves in this log.
* I definitely had an emotional dip this month.
* I have continued to wrestle with the moral problem, very clearly.
* I've been drinking more than I'd like. At least 5 times this month.
* Browser overflow. That drug needs to be tapered down as well.
* I think I need to start pulling back on my drug use more.
* My wife has been banging me more often.
* MB&A's visit was a very interesting experience for me. I need to give more thought to it.
* I continually praise [[/b/]]
* Schizo worries still there
* Rabbitholes, however, I am glad to have. It is very clear that the [[Wiki Review Log]] is a catalyst to my rabbitholing. It does make me think about myself.
* I have strong emotions in Wiki Review Log. It is a very gutteral, visceral thing. No doubt, it has much in common with [[/b/]] as a kind of Stream-of-Conscious approach to digesting myself each day.
