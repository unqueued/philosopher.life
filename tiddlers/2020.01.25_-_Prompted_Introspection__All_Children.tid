title: 2020.01.25 - Prompted Introspection: All Children

!! I wish all children would??

Choose to be wise given what they have, achieving whatever modicum of justified eudaimonia is available to them (which appears fairly bleak to me). I hope they are woke from the beginning, prepared for carefully weighed violence against the reactionary and capitalist perspectives which aim to exploit them. I wish the world was not such that I would wish this for children. They have no other recourse. =(.
