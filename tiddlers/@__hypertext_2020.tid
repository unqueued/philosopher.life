I'm learning to appreciate connecting with lots of methods. I'm grateful that you reason about the limits of this particular practice in a semi-purist fashion with us. I still take writing to be critical to (and arguably the hardest part of) relationships. Usually, I encounter the opposite problem: why would anyone pay attention to what I have to say on my wiki (and write back) when they can use more immediately gratifying mediums with lower barriers to entry that are considered (by social norm) to be more ephemeral (though, I find this word baffling), low-key, and non-committal? I don't think most people who might read as closely as you often do would want to remain so remote (not the right word, but I don't know the right one) either, so you are somewhat like a control testing group perspective to stand out against the other relationships I have which are mixed.<<footnote "h:wam" "We have very few exceptions to communicating over anything other than our sites.">> Sometimes I think we are like two scientists mutualistically studying different problems together over a series of tubes. What we have doesn't match the consistent revelatory and self-modeling work which [[Sphygmus]] and [[chameleon]] engage in; they are more strongly integrated into my daily life. I adore that writing is the centerpiece for our communication,<<footnote "h:foc" "In a way, we've overshot the golden mean toward the much rarer side of vice. It's fascinating.">> but diversity in expression is still valuable. My assumption is that if and when you want to connect further, you will. Until then, I think it's good to enjoy what we have.

<<<
looking at self-modeling as a type of permanent serialization format, where you’re attempting to prematurely get frozen (cryogenically), what medium(s) would be your chosen form of carbonite?
<<<

I'm assuming the metaphor isn't meant to be taken too strongly here, and you can correct me if I'm wrong about that.<<footnote "h:wat" "You know me, I'm nitpicky: why should I think I am attempting to //prematurely// get frozen? I agree I'm trying to learn how to create immutable aspects of objects [[irwartfrr]], not prematurely though. Serialization^^tm^^ still doesn't describe it correctly.">> The wiki is still my chosen medium, but it captures, enables, or replicates a lot of mediums and methods. Long-form writing is also still the pinnacle to me, although I have a harder time knowing what doesn't count as long-form in here. I capture a lot of stories and thoughts in this horcrux-pensieve. Sometimes, larger, evolving, emerging, or meta stories about those timeslices arise. 

If we are going sci-fi for mediums, at least for the foreseeable future, it's not clear that ML will become energy-efficient enough to do anything more than augment this medium; there are, however, possible mediums which are significantly better for self-modeling. To be clear, however, I'm not looking directly for those methods which are best at self-modeling given unlimited resources without deontic constraints. One of my preferences is to use a self-owned medium which the average joe can replicate to some extent, [[WINTCIS]]. In terms of infrastructure, text is energy-efficient, flexible, easier to compute over, cheap to store in decentralized fashions, and something which even the poor kid in India could achieve on their shitty Android phone (though, obviously, that is still severely limited).<<footnote "h:sap" "It reminds me of //Apollo 13//, where we have to ask what the folks up in space have available to them right now.">>

    Sphygmus:
    From my perspective, this worry about “projecting a facade” or “putting on a mask” is a worry about our extended lack of phenomenological contact with the qualia of others. That is, in a face-to-face conversation I have the experience of seeing and participating in another person’s outward expressions of emotion (laughing, frowning, body language, tone of voice). The true connection between the other’s internal state and their external emotions aside, I still experience a sense of physical, embodied, and emotional feedback which leads me to believe I am experiencing a true expression of their internal state.
<<<

Yeah.<<footnote "k:7" "Meaning: you’re saying great stuff - my actual response to your writing was to be dumbfounded by how solid it was and to have no good reaction - which means I’ve had to patiently walk around the neighborhood endlessly, attempting to summon a measly worthwhile thought.">> I think this was a big part of my early letters to h0p3. Like: a total doubt that written communication could work. But it turned out to be really fun and rewarding - partially because it was so difficult and fraught with peril. So I find myself wanting to avoid corporeality with you all because I want to see how far this can go.<<footnote "k:8" "Hah, and maybe we’re at the end!">>

<<<
    The internet, our websites, and our conversations over/through them completely remove and de-sync this feedback, and that disconnect triggers our unconscious to start worrying about whether we are actually receiving the truth of others’ internal states.
<<<

Yeah.<<footnote "k:9" "Meaning: so good.">> I’m not at all against video or multimedia communication - I got into Snapchat for awhile. I just want to find the strength in hypertext writing. It seems hasty to me to give up after 20 years in (10 for most people). We have a lot to learn about reading and writing online.<<footnote "k:10" "And may not be able to - so I understand anyone who wants to bail on it.">>

I think there’s a yearning for the return of text. Video and audio now dominate - and have serious issues, too. I think part of this comes from so much of human history being tied up in text - perhaps this lends a ‘sacred’ feeling to text - but it’s also that it isn’t as tied up with physical performance and is able to be ingested internally in a way. I’m seeing more people writing about what they’re reading and challenging themselves to read more - it’s still seen as a virtue in people’s minds.

I guess I feel like asking all of you: looking at self-modeling as a type of permanent serialization format, where you’re attempting to prematurely get frozen (cryogenically), what medium(s) would be your chosen form of carbonite?

I'm slow to say we connect to someone's qualia^^tm^^ directly,<<footnote "h:sqd" "Even the conditions for experiencing qualia aren't something we can be certain about.">> but we can probably get closer to it. It's an empirical process, hence your reasonable doubt. We are blackboxes (even to ourselves to some extent), and that trusting trust problem cannot be solved all the way down. There's a [[faith]] in [[The Other]] problem which is never eliminated.

While I will agree it exists, I don't know what that perfect (for the [[fff]]) solution entails, nor can I provide a perfect method for finding a solution (even accounting for our limitations). Communicating in-person often doesn't provide enough distance, and, likewise, communicating entirely remotely is usually too much distance. I agree we are wired for in-person encounters. There are significant privacy trade-offs here.  

My encounters with someone in-person do not leave me clean images that I can study later over the years; I'll only ever have fading and distorted impressions. It's true that this problem doesn't actually disappear when I have an external image to look at either, but some aspects are mitigated. Conversely, real-time communications do not give much compute time for cognitively finding collisions for deception. 

The best solutions I've found are mixing communications channels. You'll find I aim to be formal or thorough in my letter-writing, but if you catch me at 3am in IMing, I'm looser and more likely to shoot-the-shit. There comes a point in some of my relationships where voice is necessary; we simply can't communicate fast enough in writing. But, even my in-person encounters are fantastically augmented by having a wiki. I need them all to connect. Maybe conditions for feeling authenticity in connection are likely to vary on per person basis too.

The Discord server may help us build more bridges. You can also call me whenever you want [[Sphygmus]]; I've never asked if I could call you because I'm already a creeper, lol. [[Kicks]] knows he can whenever he wants to, and [[chameleon]] has muh info now as well. I'm hoping to hear your voices (I need to walk while I talk).

[3:11 PM]  robotic_scarab: er, "early" internet
[3:12 PM]  h0p3: Nope. I've seen games like it, but not this one. I like how it makes you use virtual computers in the game. "UNOX" :slight_smile:
[3:14 PM]  h0p3: Were you ever into Myst?
[3:18 PM]  robotic_scarab: hm, no myst
[3:19 PM]  robotic_scarab: i've tried to play it since but it's almost too obscure for me -- or i'm just not devoted enough to pressing random buttons to see what happens anymore, lol
[3:19 PM]  h0p3: I never had the patience.
[3:20 PM]  robotic_scarab: my first video game was really a free copy of amazon trails that was included in a cheerio box promo with "LightDog" advertising
[3:21 PM]  robotic_scarab: hilarious because the longest time I played it, sitting on the first screen, never figuring out how to get the canoe to advance
[3:21 PM]  robotic_scarab: somehow eventually I did figure it out though and then it got even more fun!
[3:22 PM]  robotic_scarab: the rest of my gaming was edu-tainment, carmen san diego (<3), floppy disk edu-tainment games (treasure math storm, treasure mountain, etc) and a few handed down cd games (jump start advanced 4th grade lmao, sim city 2000 (the best))
[3:22 PM]  h0p3: ...took the words right out of my mouth, Carmen San Diego.
[3:22 PM]  robotic_scarab: she was so suave
[3:22 PM]  robotic_scarab: of course the maze screen saver in windows 98 provided hours of entertainment on its own :joy:
[3:24 PM]  robotic_scarab: http://www.ohio-distinctive.com/games/green/green.html must be the precursor to my love for stardew valley rofl
[3:24 PM]  h0p3: Games got way more fun over the years.
[3:25 PM]  h0p3: Yeah, you did have a lot of edutainment, lol. :slight_smile:
[3:26 PM]  robotic_scarab: not the typical gamecube / gameboy memories of my generation but fun nonetheless :relaxed:
[3:30 PM]  h0p3: dusting out the cobwebs in muh brain here, first for me was: The California Raisins on C64 and Pong on Atari. Didn't get to play much though. Carmen San Diego and Oregon Trail at school, alongside the other edutainment possibilities, were where I got to spend more time just playing. I loved the computer lab.
[3:31 PM]  robotic_scarab: apparently there's a carmen san diego show now?? no idea if it's any good at all
[3:35 PM]  h0p3: Noice. Looks nicer than the older shows.
[6:35 PM]  chameleon: @robotic_scarab what's that xx character, is it in unicode?
[6:35 PM]  chameleon: X
X
[6:35 PM]  chameleon:

[6:38 PM]  robotic_scarab: it's in the rune section of Unicode I believe
[6:38 PM]  robotic_scarab: Give me a sec and I'll find the code
[6:40 PM]  robotic_scarab: https://unicode-table.com/en/16DD/
ᛝ - Runic Letter Ing  (U+16DD)
Symbol: ᛝ, the characters name: Runic Letter Ing, Unicode number for the sign: U+16DD, the icon is included in the block: Runic.
[6:44 PM]  chameleon: Thanks!
[6:44 PM]  chameleon: Time to make :lucid:
[6:44 PM]  chameleon: :seizonsenryaku:
[6:52 PM]  chameleon: :lucid:
[6:53 PM]  chameleon: I could presumably make a :redacted: as well :stuck_out_tongue:
[6:53 PM]  robotic_scarab: haha! yes, I like that unicode rune a lot too
[6:53 PM]  robotic_scarab: https://unicode-table.com/en/16A1/
ᚡ - Runic Letter V  (U+16A1)
Symbol: ᚡ, the characters name: Runic Letter V, Unicode number for the sign: U+16A1, the icon is included in the block: Runic.
[6:54 PM]  chameleon: Just a ᚡ? wasn't it two runes?
[6:54 PM]  robotic_scarab: oh yes you're right it's a combo
[6:55 PM]  robotic_scarab: ᚮᚡ
[6:55 PM]  robotic_scarab: https://unicode-table.com/en/16AE/
ᚮ - Runic Letter O  (U+16AE)
Symbol: ᚮ, the characters name: Runic Letter O, Unicode number for the sign: U+16AE, the icon is included in the block: Runic.
[6:56 PM]  chameleon:

[6:57 PM]  robotic_scarab: i wonder what font discord uses? the runes show up different in discord than in FF for me
[6:57 PM]  chameleon: yeah hm

[9:21 AM]  robotic_scarab: a decent number of my first dates in college were meeting up at a coffee shop on campus and, at my suggestion, playing a game (either a card game with the pack I had brought or an actual board game in the coffee shop that had actual board games)
[9:22 AM]  robotic_scarab: i'm not quite sure how good of a strategy that is overall but it did help me with the otherwise sort of awkward gaps that might happen in a conversation with someone completely new :P
[9:23 AM]  robotic_scarab: I feel like card games in particular have a history of social bonding, sitting around a table shooting the shit and playing pinocle or gin rummy or something, lol
[12:09 PM]  h0p3: Far more competent than I am on this front. Didn't go on many dates, and only dated people I already knew. k0sh3k asked me out for coffee, and I'm like: "thank you, but I don't like coffee" (at the time, I didn't). /facepalm.

I think enjoying instant messenger (ICQ and MSN messenger) was super important though. k0sh3k got drunk and just asked me over messenger while I was playing Everquest 2.
[12:15 PM]  chameleon: hehe
[12:15 PM]  chameleon: I'm at least old enough to have used that a little while I was at school
[12:15 PM]  chameleon: (mostly to make AMVs and talk about anime girls with my buddy Chris. I miss that guy)
[12:16 PM]  chameleon: he got really confused once because I was playing runescape and managed to have my MSN window focused instead
[12:16 PM]  chameleon: so I was talking one-sidededly about runescape shit to someone in game =w=.

[2:47 PM]  robotic_scarab: windows live messenger is what it was called when I used it with kids from another family -- definitely missed out on the AIM era (I wasn't allowed to have my own user account on the family computer until I turned 13 -- of course that rule got relaxed for my brother :eyes: )

[2:54 PM]  h0p3: No idea if it was because he's a dude, either. I stayed with a fundie family from El Salvador for a chunk of a summer. They have 4 daughters (one of which was in her 20's), and I'm 16 at the time. They said it was totally fine for me to be out as late as I want because I was a manboy. Even the adult daughter had a curfew though. Double standards are not easy to justify.
[2:57 PM]  h0p3: I had it relatively easy on my machine until I got kicked out of school. Then my usage and machine was started getting scrutinized (more than usual blockers). You'd get kicked out of the house for having watched porn in my house though (since that might bring the devil into the home).

    @chameleon:
    I’d like to pre-emptively avoid lumping in “activists” with those types of people.
<<<

Yeah, ok, I need to fill that in a bit. I’m not making a judgement here. I’m not putting them all in a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ category. There are good and bad trolls, good and bad activists.<<footnote "k:4" "I will say that I imagine that, like a craft or role, there are probably true experts and the rest of us are just playing, probably destructively. I think that’s the thing about trolls and activists. You have to have quality moves as well as real message. That’s asking a lot! I think it’s this thought, of ‘minions’ that operate in the ‘troll’ and ‘activist’ roles, that really make me think to group them together.">> (Although sometimes I wonder if centuries from now we’ll look back and see the pursuit for humor as being far more virtuous and generous than the pursuit for political ground. Maybe slightly - eh probably not.)<<footnote "k:5" "Also, could activists be more effective as trolls? While [[throwing|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM3nucc3XTc]] a shoe is activism, I think I have to score it in the troll camp.">>

My grouping here is more a matter of directionality or something. Hypertext 2010 was an effort in isolation - or solipsism, as you say - impossible to intrude upon (without hacking it) - so quite unsuitable for a troll or activist, whose fuel requires targets, people to trigger or people to sway. We don’t really have those directional targets. I mean I’m cool if people join us, but it’s not essential.

In fact, I think, for me, the directionality is inverted. I’m here to read. I’m not trying to own or gather up a bunch of Winnie Lims. I just want to read what she’s got and see what happens.<<footnote "k:6" "Like it’s a catalyst? Like it’s an unknown substance? What happens if I put THIS in the tank?">> Maybe I want to be owned and gathered. No, that’s not it - I mean perhaps in the moment of reading, I’m happy to be destroyed by it - but I’ve got my own thing I’m doing, it’s just going to be less dramatic. The directionality is just: I want to collect some of these cool stickers you’re offering. It’s like the pleasant capitalism that happens at the level of coins rather than cash.

It’s possible that ‘hypertext 2020’ continues to be hermetic, ‘staying under wraps’. But, no, I think that while trying to articulate this directionality, I want that inverted movement. Perhaps it’s like a vacuum tube where the pressure got too hot. So now a hole broke and everything is getting sucked inside. It’s a nice breeze. Time to break some glass.

Agreed on the mainstream - just on principle. My back is [[turned|https://www.kickscondor.com/flooding-the-culture]].

Part of the solipsistic nature of the wiki is that trolls don't really have much of an effect on it. I don't visit that side of the internet and I'd prefer to keep it that way. It's in public, but I could easily lock it down by using basic authentication or cryptography or whatever.

I'd like to pre-emptively avoid lumping in "activists" with those types of people. My very existence is political in today's hyperpartisan world, and many of those "activists" are at least attempting to make the world a better place, even if I don't agree with their approach ([[not by half|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Cancel%2FCallout%20Culture]]). The only "activists" I'd shit on are those that appropriate the language of activism to perpetuate bigotry, i.e. TERFs and other second-wavers.

Outside of just, y'know, ignoring them and focusing on my wiki, I exist in a true cozyweb too. 2dl has a gatekeeping system, and beyond that I exist in PMs and the like which (except with [[h0p3]]) generally stay ''private'' messages. I've thought about starting a group chat, or even private mailing list. I appreciate the notion of staying under wraps. I love that "[[dark forest|https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1]]" analogy.

> I guess my question is: to what degree do you feel the four of us are being shaped by the culture? Or are we attempting to reshape it in miniature?

As much as possible, I want to negate, even escape, the ~culture~. I don't like the mainstream 2010s-now-2020s internet. I hate twitter, I hate facebook, I hate 99% of youtube, I hate instagram, and `<s>`i hate everyone that posts there.`</s>`

If I had my way, we'd all forget the irony-poisoned, toxic, proprietary-software cultural shit-show of today and use the infrastructure we have to replicate and expand on what was good about the past. I want to see an internet which is just about weird, funny shit again. I want communities which are about sharing our love of something, not shitting on what someone else likes, or gatekeeping each other for having insufficiently patrician taste. I want an end to harassment; to reactionary bullying; to corporate shills and #influencers. I want the internet to be fun again.

<br>

''>> 2020.01-21: [[kickscondor]]''

Those are big questions.

Outgrouping cannot be escaped online or offine, it can only be shaped. There are no neutral parties or people devoid of ideology (even if a person may describe themselves as such). Even attempting to avoid or calmly stand outside of cultural war is an act of cultural warfare (though it may be the justified move in some cases).

If I understand correctly, a cozyweb is a dialectical body designed with infrastructural outgrouping. To varying [[dok]], it tends to shield itself from the public and provides its users various control mechanisms for avoiding conflict with most of the world (which is not the claim this is always justified). Parts of what I'm engaged in here isn't toward the cozyweb because it's too public (vulnerable and compromised even with pseudonymity), however, the funnels do limit the probabilities of how the public might engage or react to it.

Cultures are the dialectically ordered spheres of belief and desire of agents. Beyond curiosity, I don't think there is anything particularly special about them at first glance; lots of creatures have them. Ours are interesting because we can be responsible for them (which I wouldn't say about, for example, a bee culture). Hence, I am a culturalist; not all cultures of persons are morally equal. At the very least, some are permissible and some are not in various circumstances. 

I don't know the degree to which each of us are shaped by "the culture" (which I presume to be the set of all cultures on the planet), and it's not easy to pick out what consists in "shaping." Someone can hold a gun to my head and say "jump or I shoot," and I'm still capable of choosing not to jump (even if I'm not politically free to do otherwise); that kind of freedom is what allows us to intervene upon how culture shapes us to some [[dok]]. We can react differently and choose not to assent. Unless we're thinking about a causally isolated agent with beliefs and desires (and perhaps not even then, depending on the nature of the agent), culture always shapes an agent to some [[dok]]. Some influences are more direct or efficacious than others, and our responsibilities vary. 

How does it work culturally (as a description) is a different matter than how it ought to work (as a prescription). Are the beliefs and desires of a culture justified? I have doubts that we'll have a practice which is justifiable and contagious at the same time. I am not convinced our work here will likely be of any serious consequence at large, so the attempt is a Hail Mary pass (one I'm obligated to attempt). There is work to do in improving the odds of success though.


<br>

Ok, thank you - the answers about ‘funneling’ or ‘iceberging’ or ‘shitpiling’ or whatever you want to call it are all really interesting. I really like Chamy’s take on drafting as another layer. I hadn’t considered that kind of granularity at all.

I guess we can start to wind the discussion down - I think the last thing I want to ask about touches on the ‘culture wars’ and the surrounding online warfare that we find ourselves in. Specifically: the ingroup/outgroup dynamics that plague the Internet, the trolls and activists that stoke the fire, and the norms that are being established around how one should talk and write publicly. This is already a topic in the discussion - the personal/private distinction we’ve discussed indicates where we stand in defending ourselves, the topic of doorways into our icebergs is somewhat about who to invite and how to set the right note - and h0p3 just went into how the funnel can ‘bounce’ trolls and vampires. (Which troubles me, because I like to meet trolls and vampires, too. For sure I’d love to meet vampires! I’m not sure I want them to bounce as much as to rattle around inside.)

So this topic might kill the discussion - I feel like it’s more enjoyable to just allude to the conflict rather than to take it on - not that no one’s talking about it, it’s like everyone is talking about it all of the time. And I think it goes without saying that the shape of our ‘cozyweb’ is due to these forces.

I guess my question is: to what degree do you feel the four of us are being shaped by the culture? Or are we attempting to reshape it in miniature? Because ‘hypertext 2020’ isn’t really a complete discussion without some vision for how our smaller landscape could function. We have some good ideas for how the craft of hypertext might progress in 2020. How can it possibly work culturally?

<<<
Can I provide it?
<<<

I think that's the real issue. We get to be librarians about ourselves for [[others]]. It's a human that picks it out at least sometimes, even if assisted by some crucial cataloging strategies and search tools. I'm convinced we serve up who we are to others in a way they can wander on their own, but we also serve as a live-ish helpdesk to our own [[PSM]]s. A librarian has to interview the user to understand what they need or want. You provide some one-size-fits-all approaches, and then you are well-positioned to work on the exceptions.

<<<
Journal entries are fleeting things.
<<<

I think almost everyone agrees with you here. I don't think it's an easy problem. Like, if the story of our lives is really just ephemeral, if re-using our data doesn't matter, then why write them down (or, rather, why keep them and catalog them, why search through them?)? I re-use some percentage of my journal entries in different ways (beyond [[Know Thyself]]), and I don't know which ones are going to be important up front. What's good log-keeping in computing? I don't know.

<<<
Development Levels
<<<

I like your developmental levels. Perhaps when (''if'', who am I kidding? ;P) I get to [[The Remodeling]] again, I'll work toward that in a field. There's something to it. If tiddlers are atoms, I want to know what kinds of project molecules should be assigned development levels and so forth (beyond what I have in [[Hub]]). I have no idea what I'm doing on this front, as usual. =)

Yeah, that has to be one of the most interesting issues in reasoning about the wiki structure.  What's really important may pop up there. How should things cluster together? What does it mean to efficiently find what is relevant? The bigger the wiki gets, the more I'm forced to use the search tools, and the less I can navigate it like a directory. Eventually, even I will likely be forced to use more dynamic tooling to navigate ad hoc directory structures in my own wiki with the kin-based [[Locator]].

It's difficult for me to know what it is like for the reader. I work for that linearity, layering, funneling, and hierarchy. I see structures which emerge or jut out of the ball of chaos. My assumption is that a wanderer is forced into exploring and seeing themselves positioned relative to roads they've been down, and that gets tricky with such a non-linear ball.

Yup! =). You are inviting, and your price is gentle. You reward degrees of curiosity. It generates valuable chatter, imho; some connections being stronger than others. I think you initiate the [[T42T]] handshake in making it available, but the funnel or steps for cooperation usefully bounces trolls, [[MOPs|https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths]], vampires, and those who aren't interested in a fair commitment.

Where do you start? [[Root]]? The tag list?

What are you looking for?

Can I provide it?

I don't know. Inspired by kicks' and h0p3's comments, I wrote [[ReadMe|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#ReadMe]]. Maybe that'll provide some direction. Maybe it'll just confuse the travelers even more.

The iceberg/inverted funnel idea is lovely. My wiki is a dungeon in the depths already, but that it goes so into the deep you may never return... that's a scary thought, but fits the aesthetic!

When I first came across h0p3's wiki, I had intense vertigo. I knew there was more there than I could ever read. I got scared. I fell back on twitter memes. I hunted for reactionary sentiments so I could turn away. The abyss stared back. I'm very glad he wrote me, and that I was able to reply. I'm very glad I have the wiki. I'm a different person now, a better person for it, in my opinion. I like to think I'm one of the good ones™.

> My on this day tiddler also surfaces them without context other than the particular day they were created, so the more distantly linked tiddlers might appear there. The older my dated entries are, the more links they're buried behind (log collection > yearly audit > monthly audit > dailies), while the topical tiddlers are pretty high up (either linked directly in my sidebar or one layer below).

hm. Some of my tiddlers, too, are buried by time. I use the search bar when writing a //previously.// Even I'm starting to forget what I have buried in here. Ultimately, it does provide a good resource. I've more than once forgotten some minutiæ, gone back through the logs, and found it again.

Kicks, I forget where, but I made the distinction before: tiddlers VS articles VS journals. Tiddlers are the superset, and articles are subject to the [[Development Levels|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Development%20Levels]]. Journal entries are fleeting things. They will be lost in time if not tagged, but they're still there beneath the surface.

> So I think of this as a kind of inverted funnel - where you have these entry points to your wiki - might be an ‘about’ page or it might be one of your sidebar directories or some intermediate topical page - and pages are situated somewhere in this conical area, perhaps you are even aware of how far a page might be from the doorway when you post it. Or which series of doorways reach it.

//this is a drafting thought holder// okay this is a fascinating visualization of the layering of hypertext in the wiki. When doing my audits recently I've been thinking of it in terms of linking, and distance from discovery (kind of like 6 Degrees of Sphygmus). Some tiddlers are only linked to by one or two others and are more distant from the surface in that way. The tiddlers with one or maybe two links are actually more hidden than the "real" orphans -- at least those get their [[own section|$:/core/ui/MoreSideBar/Orphans]].

My //on this day// tiddler also surfaces them without context other than the particular day they were created, so the more distantly linked tiddlers might appear there. The older my dated entries are, the more links they're buried behind (log collection > yearly audit > monthly audit > dailies), while the topical tiddlers are pretty high up (either linked directly in my sidebar or one layer below).

: I think I like that this means the older journal entries will "fade" in terms of linking layers. People have to be at least somewhat nosy to poke around in the older daily logs. (unless they're looking at //on this day// ofc.)

> I’d like to propose this question as our next point of conversation: “what on this massive highly-interlinked website might I want to start reading?”

Yeah, ok - let’s get into this. What has really inspired me about all of your wikis - and some of the newer personal websites I’ve run into - is this layering of the hypertext. h0p3 has the ‘about’ page, people might have a timeline or a ‘now’ page on their site, even Twitter with its ‘pinned post’ - you don’t just have to have a blog that drops you into chronological posts.

But it goes much deeper that this. I’m starting to think of it as //funneling//, having layers of hypertext that become progressively more personal, or which become more detailed, or perhaps even more (or less) ephemeral as you go through the layers.

I think part of this is an evolution of the fragmentation that has happened in social networks. People may use Twitter for a certain self-image or community, then Facebook or a blog for another mode, and people have become very accustomed to using each network as a separate outlet. And there’s a nice advantage to this - because you can address groups differently and not expose certain groups to overly personal material or control the image you project in each network.

In a similar way, I see this with Nadia Eghbal’s site - she has a newsletter for offering a monthly summary of her work, or there is the blog where you can read essays when they are published, and then she has a raw [[notes|https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/]] page that isn’t tied to any notification system (like RSS even), so you have to go out of your way to visit the page to catch anything new. So rather than having separate networks, there are different avenues to how you can approach her work.

Your wikis accomplish these layers using titling conventions. Usually ephemeral stuff is marked with a date, letters marked with ‘@’, permanent content is plainly titled. But this is also related to your front page material - you all know where to hide on your wikis the more personal material that you post and how to surface the things that are more central to your dialogue with the rest of us. (Sphygmus’ page coloring is a very interesting approach here.)

So I think of this as a kind of inverted funnel - where you have these entry points to your wiki - might be an ‘about’ page or it might be one of your sidebar directories or some intermediate topical page - and pages are situated somewhere in this conical area, perhaps you are even aware of how far a page might be from the doorway when you post it. Or which series of doorways reach it.

(//I’m wondering what you think about this concept - what I’ve got wrong or if I’m characterizing your process correctly.//)

>    kicks, I think you already address this in your FILE_ID pop-up - would you say more about how you thought about what to put there?

Well, that file is kind of my personal website, but it’s hidden inside of a little square. I like my site to be disorienting to happen upon, because I think it demands a bit of curiosity as an admission fee. (I think you do this too with your KEEP OUT notebook. It has lips on it, which soften the sting.)

But I’m so big on directories - it occured to me that I could evolve the ‘pinned post’ into something like a mini-directory. h0p3’s ‘root’ page is much more detailed - it’s five pages in one - and each page is terrifically long. I just tried to think about what a mini-directory or cover page would look like.

I also like to hide it because talking about myself is very uncomfortable. I feel very insignificant - but I like it that way - to have to feel that my own ideas or personality or opinions are very valuable - that would be too much to handle. I’d rather have little ideas and wrong ideas of my own - and just be a random person living life and no need to size up what I’m saying against the great ideas of history - no need to establish some track record of being right or upstanding.<<footnote "k:[3]" "Although I do get caught up in the allure of cultural commentary and trying to articulate a perspective that, in the moment, might feel ‘right’ - I only hope these are taken as good fun and not as objective truth.">>

So sometimes I think about getting rid of it - it seems like an advertisement for myself. But I hold out hope that I can make it a mini-directory and eliminate the self-promotional aspects. (On the other hand, I want to encourage other people to self-promote, so I don’t know why I see it as so shameful to write that way - when I like for other people to do it.)

I think the biggest discovery that I’ve made with ‘funneling’ is to have my /all unfiltered page and then to have a main page. To describe it in TiddlyWiki terms, it’s as if I’ve taken my ‘recent’ sidebar and curated it on the home page. And, rather than using titling conventions to do it, I use metadata - so that some entries are marked ‘hidden’ or ‘draft’ and that keeps them off the home page.

>    Are there things us wikis could be doing to better serve readers? Is it important for us to attempt to provide something like this for readers? Should it look like Gwern’s index, or is there a more wiki-native solution that might be more ideal?

I don’t know - the thing I’ve really enjoyed about your public wikis is that I’ve had to learn your conventions before getting into them. I think you require something from your readers - and I think that sets up a really healthy relationship that the rest of the Internet has struggled with. It’s not their place; it’s yours. And that’s abundantly clear. But when I became comfortable in your wiki, you may have trusted that I had done sufficient work to be worth interacting with.

But then again, I like funneling and there would be no cone without the point. Yours is a static image - but it’s also the colored tags to the side. I think you set the right mood for what it is you’re doing. Sometimes I wish I was structured more like a wiki - but stylistically I’m trying to evoke a turn of the century blog - and aesthetic is important to me, because it surrounds everything else. It accomplishes something that can’t be expressed or done any other way.

> Are we modeling fictional characters or not? Does it matter?

        h0p3:
        We face infinigresses here; in a sense, it can’t be satisfied by us, it can only be sought.
<<<

I’m having a very difficult time replying to this (and the remarks that follow it.) Not because it’s not well-written or because I don’t agree - simply because I want to expand on it, but haven’t the language to do it.

But, to begin, I think there is something about ‘now’ which I think is important. We can’t satisfy the modeling of ourselves in a moment (‘now’), but we can’t develop something over time.

<<<
    Who we are can only be understood through dialectics with others, and at least sometimes that occurs through dialectics with imagined characters. Of course, certainty cannot be achieved, (h:cba. Of course, certainty cannot be achieved, and any time you posit a limit, you posit something beyond it.) and any time you posit a limit, you posit something beyond it. (h:sbi. and what is beyond that limit is sometimes only something which fiction can initially explore.)
<<<

Similarly, if I //sought// after your model, I couldn’t achieve it ‘now’, in an instant. It would become assembled over time, as if it was a gigantic LEGO castle.

But what I wonder is: are the old models relevant to the ‘now’ model? Can I render all models useless in an instant? Perhaps, in modeling, I look back and see the model of me - and suddenly want nothing to do with it. Or perhaps it’s more light-hearted than that - it’s time for a drastic change. Or I’m just embarassed - that seems likely!

I’m not suggesting that the models are flawed - all the people I know who have gone through the death of many family members at once, this model becomes quite precious. For the memories it holds, but also because you don’t want to lose who you are through the process. You rely on the history of yourself to help you not lose yourself to an internally destructive force that wants to kill you.

But then - there are things from ourselves that we can’t take with us always. Ideas become outdated, of course. And then, like losing someone who we’ve had plans with, who suddenly is gone, any of our plans or projects might not survive in the present.

This also relates to the discussion about clarifying ‘wonderful’.

<<<
    The process of clarifying who we are, including what is valuable to us, (//fantastic Socratic anecdote, tyyyy//) appears to be at least part of the treadmill of generating our models, and they ought to be. Our brains are constantly modeling the world (including ourselves); there’d be no intentional consciousness without it.
<<<

I may think something is wonderful in the ‘now’ but that could change. (//I try to resist that, though - and to always be grateful for the things I’ve loved from the past. This helps me to guarantee that I will always love philosopher.life!//) But I can’t always nab (in the instant) why I love something. And I feel that even attempting to can be foolhardy. In the moment, I can usually only assemble a tiny LEGO flower of an impression. And it often seems better to hold off and try to assemble something more. Although: flowers are dainty and beautiful in their own right and I can still later surround them with LEGO cabbages and LEGO motorcycles and minotaurs and to build the fine scenery that I mean to.

And I also think that my LEGO flower (in this case) would be the phrase, “I love it because it makes my life worth living.” And to avoid the rational dissection of it is to grant it real life for the moment.

(//Of course, I’m not opposed to the conversation with Socrates, I would have it in an instant//. “Because drinks are more seasonal to me,” I say to him. “Drinks can’t be //more// seasonal,” he says, “because they have no seasons.” I say, “Oh yes, they do. They hover right above the liquid…”)

> How much risk do we each face?

Minimal, imo. I've been friends with much more dangerous individuals than the types that are likely to stumble across my wiki; and the wiki isn't really connected to my irl identity anyways apart from some vague gesturings towards locations, and even then I'm likely to just be lost in the crowd. The worst that will happen is that people will point and laugh, and I can take that.

And hey, at the risk of sounding edgy, I can defend myself. Your white supremacist buddy, if he can even find me (he can't) will be enjoying a bullet in his dome if he ever comes near me.

Besides that, I'm not terribly interesting and thus wouldn't make a very good target. The narcissistic focus of the wiki betrays the fact that I'm actually rather boring and milquetoast; I'm barely even politically active besides doing my civic duty of voting.

> What do you want my wiki and RGM to become to protect you?

It's fun. It lets people see what I'm working on, and thus opens collaboration opportunities ([[Zodai|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Zodai]] and I have already toyed with this, outside of our little clique). And more than a little emulation/hero worship. I'm young and romantic at heart and like to copy things that my [[Senpai|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Senpai]]s do.

All things are memes, all things are serious. I mock that which I care about, sometimes, because that's how I know I can really care.

Well, I think I'm just irony poisoned by too much time on social media and chans and that's made me prone to joking about things I'm serious about, or taking a mocking tone at all times.

    Kicks, do you ever deal with information overload? Like, you’re browsing and surfing and discovering personal websites and interesting articles and now you’ve got 10, 15, 20 tabs (tb: 100s?!i??!) open and they all seem like cool rabbit holes and you’re not quite sure where to go next? Or what it all means anymore? (maybe that’s just me.)
<<<

I have experienced this in the past - and I still experience this with books. Although I’m not sure it’s the same. What I experience is //gah, I’m not spending enough time reading all the things I want to read, finding all the things I want to discover, given how much there is!!// And I assume that’s what people mean when they say ‘information overload’. (Your image of so many tabs.)

Is it actually ‘overload’? Or is it that there is infinite information (and there was even a century ago) and you’re feeling some inability to approach it? Which, in my case, has usually been about losing my discipline for a time span.

But I am spending the right amount of time reading online right now - and I have a very long list to work through that is in a sensible order. (I no longer have tabs open - I do have a link list, so that has helped.) I am not spending enough time reading books. If I spend enough hours each week, I feel like I am at least methodically working through the infinite mass and I feel healthy.

    If yes, what do you do with that feeling? Does curation help? Like you’re specifically looking for cool people doing cool things in obscurity and you want to let us folks in your corner of the world – so does the endless array of cool people doing cool things feel overwhelming or invigorating or? (I get the sense it might be the opposite, that you feel like it’s hard to find cool people doing cool things. correct me here!)

It’s so cool to me that you care to ask me a question like this! That, alone, makes me feel like there are plenty of ‘cool people doing cool things’. Even if it was just you and me - that would be enough.

No, I feel like there are many more cool people than I can possibly be aware of. I worry sometimes that I have no sensibility. I honestly find something amazing in almost everyone I discover. If they are working in hypertext, it feels like I can count on it. And yeah – it’s invigorating.

I do wish I was aware of more black writers. I know there is a tendency to do this out of guilt or political activism. But I simply feel like black writers have an unusual angle. I think this is why black artists are popular in mainstream culture - subconsciously we know that they are outliers and can show us what it means to be human in a totally unexpected way. I mean I am definitely interested in anyone out there, regardless of their race - but among Americans, I think black artists have shown that they are always on the avant garde of cultural movements.

So, at the same time, it is difficult to find certain subcultures that you may want to find. (I would also love to find a really sweet fitness goth blog. Especially if it was a .onion site.)

When I do find someone that I really really REAALLY connect with - then I greedily spam that link wherever I can - in my notes, into Fraidycat, I recite it in my mind. I am so afraid of losing it. And it means that I begin to visit that site very frequently, to try to read everything that I can. When I found [[Ton’s blog|https://www.zylstra.org/blog/]], it was like that. And I was very appreciative that I could tell which posts were ephemeral and which were polished, finalized essays.

This is also what helped get me into h0p3 (and you and chamy, because you follow the same conventions): because you clearly mark dated, temporary notes vs longer, central nodes or essays. So it is very easy to know where to ‘start’. Which is appreciated when I am discovering someone and want to move from the polished stuff down to the day-to-day stuff.

I don't think these questions just matter to me; I think they matter more objectively. 
 
Maybe you are asking: what is the "self"? I don't have a satisfactory answer.

Maybe you need to define fiction further for me. It may come in [[dok]]. It seems like the relationship between author intentions and reader interpretations may define fiction in context. This is not an area I understand nearly well enough.

Insofar as imaginary characters pop up in our [[phenomenology]], we are modeling imaginary characters who are a part of who we are. Humor, irony, counterfactuals, hypothetical reasoning, rhetoric, and imagination all seem to have fictional elements to them; all of those are part of my modeling. Even proofs in classical logic rely upon the absurd, particularly in [subproofs, stages, or layers], to eventually point us to the truth. In some cases, we are forced to model things we don't mean in order to model the things we do. We also might think of choice as modeling who we could be, generating a set of fictional characters, and selecting from them. I'm open to the claim models always have something fictional about them insofar as we pretend they are the things-in-themselves. Bohr's model or Newtonian physics might be fictions in a sense, but they act as intuition pumps and provide the initial kernel material over which we can iterate and bootstrap a more accurate model too.

Do I think the "self" is a fiction? It depends. We can be wrong about who we are because there is an objective "who we are."<<footnote "h:hyd" "How you define yourself is not who you are, but only a part of it.">> Who we think we are (including our own modeling of the world) might be fictional in some sense, but the gap between who we think we are and who we actually are is not fictional (though it seems even that gap is built into "who we are"). Who we are can only be understood through dialectics with others, and at least sometimes that occurs through dialectics with imagined characters. Of course, certainty cannot be achieved,<<footnote "h:cba" "If justified certainty is the absolute standard for knowledge, then we cannot know if we are modeling fictional characters.">> and any time you posit a limit, you posit something beyond it. <<footnote "h:sbi" "and what is beyond that limit is sometimes only something which fiction can initially explore">> 

Yes, it matters who we are, especially since what matters about who we are can't be solely defined by us. It matters [[W5H]] we attempt to represent ourselves, and fiction matters at least with respect to how it serves reality. If I recognize it as such, I try to ask myself, "What is this fiction for?" The purpose of fiction is part of its meaning.

To me, wonderful things and wonderful people make life worth living. (How do I know if it’s ‘wonderful’? — Because it makes my life worth living.) (To prevent you from asking me to clarify - it ends there - an instinctive feeling of simply ‘this is worth it to me’.)
<<<

The process of clarifying who we are, including what is valuable to us,<<footnote "h:ssm" "Socrates goes up to the counter. “What would you like?” asks the barista. “What would you recommend?” asks Socrates. “I would go with the pumpkin spice latte,” says the barista. “Why?” asks Socrates. “It’s seasonal,” she answers. “But why exactly is a seasonal drink better than a non-seasonal drink?” “Well,” said the barista, “I guess it helps to connect you to the rhythm of the changing seasons.” “But do you do other things to connect yourself to that rhythm?” asked Socrates. “Like wear seasonal clothing? Or read seasonal books? If not, how come it’s only drinks that are seasonal?” “I’m not sure,” says the barista. “Think about it,” says Socrates, and leaves without getting anything.">> appears to be at least part of the treadmill of generating our models, and they ought to be. Our brains are constantly modeling the world (including ourselves); there'd be no intentional consciousness without it. 

I agree even the possibility of wonderful people (and other things in virtue of them) are fundamental to what makes life worth living. 

What makes a person wonderful "to me" is not necessarily what makes a person wonderful. Likewise, what makes life worth living "to me" and what makes it objectively worth living are not identical; I can only hope to try to wisely close the gap. I agree that sentiments of "this is worth it to me" are a fundamental part of the objective calculation of what actually makes it worth it. One can be wrong about what makes life worth living though, which is why continued clarification is necessary; we are obligated to attempt to improve our understanding of what makes life worth living and what counts as "wonderful."<<footnote "h:tfe" "I suggest wonderful things can obtain even if there's no one there to think they are wonderful.">>

Even though I agree your instinct, intuition, and sentiment (and their development or inspiration) are necessary, that doesn't make them sufficiently justified.<<footnote "h:tsj" "The 'because I said so' parental cliche is not a strong argument. The ultimate reasons 'why' aren't competely inherent to any particualr agent's point of view.">> There can be a difference between what you want and what you should want. Godwin's Law: what makes Hitler's sentiments about what matters (including what makes his life worth living) objectively wrong in some cases? Is it simply because he doesn't value what I value? Why should we be prevented from asking him to clarify not just what it means for him to say "this is worth it to me," but also "why should it be worth it to him?" We are hitting the paradox of tolerance here, and we have to think about how to justify intolerance. At the very least, it requires democratically mapping and weighing all of our instincts (though that itself is seeking objective evaluation). Part of the issue is that we don't obviously have a moral right to be just any version of ourselves. We don't own ourselves all the way down, including our epistemic justifications. We actually owe things to others (duties and rights correspond, and ownership is defined by clusters of those relationships), though that may be what you are trying to get at in living for "wonderful people" here. First-personally, justice is at least fairness in negotiating between what is valuable "to me" (whatever the self is) and "to others."

Some people think of philosophy as a form of therapy. There is a kind of peace which one might achieve by no longer asking "why" or stoically minimizing desires. Some might go so far as to say the only solution is to dissolve the belief there was a problem at all. 

Lastly, the brain has evolved to be a probabilistic inference machine that seeks energy-efficient modeling (those specimens tend to be more likely to survive).<<footnote "h:nts" "Interestingly, the experience of time may be related to the amount of energy necessary to compute what is novel, and on a view like Heidegger's, we're trying to escape thinking about the world, as though the evolutionary pursuit of energy-efficiency pushes consciousness to seek eliminating itself.">> One energy-efficient filter, inference, or instinct about value is to say it matters because I say it matters, and leave it at that. Conversely, one could be chemically addicted to continually trying to ask and answer "why."

I like the PSM topic. What does it mean to me?

I started the wiki out of writer's block on my blog, and it quickly grew into something I actually had fun working on. But what it's //for// is an interesting question.

The subtitle is "things chameleon knows" and I feel like that encapsulates it. To me this is a website to throw my ideas to the wall and see what sticks. It's obviously not every last thing I know, but it covers a broad spectrum of my interests and ideas.

    Perhaps it’s about feeling — when the wind is warm but just a little sharp, and blows that feeling of longing straight through your bones — if one empathizes with that feeling, resonates with it, then perhaps they’ll resonate with my work as well.
<<<

(//First off - great quotes! The low-key Nadia quote is unexpected, but very refreshing//.)

I actually think your wiki is an ‘artist statement’ without needing to explicitly state that - and I think that’s why h0p3 could capture your essence so clearly. Maybe he inferred it from all the pieces?

With h0p3, I think I am more curious about the ‘self-modeling’ part of the phrase - but with you I definitely wonder more about the ‘public’ part. And you kind of answer that here. It sounds like you’re looking for kindred spirits. But you also keep a lot of things private - and you do explain this from a curatorial angle:

<<<
    Perhaps it’s confusing to stumble upon a website where everything is mashed together — the mundane details of what I ate yesterday right alongside finished letters, notes on projects, and my drafting of this response.
<<<

How do you decide what to reveal and what to make public? (I ask because I haven’t resolved this for myself either - whereas I think h0p3 has made this line very easy for himself.)<<footnote "k:[2]" "This also seems very pertinent to the question of ‘public self-modeling’, since h0p3 begins defining this phrase by exhorting people to ‘deprivatize’ themselves. ">>

<<<
    h0p3:
    I take it that you don’t see yourself as a PSM, kicks. Is that fair to say?
<<<

Yeah, I see more self as a conduit. I really get into finding people and connecting people (and saying hi to them). I don’t have a desire to preserve myself or to catalog myself. But having the dialetic does make some of that worthwhile. And maybe I do model myself in other ways: in pixels, in code, in colors flickering.

I mean - you’ve all influenced me a lot and I find myself mimicking some of your conventions. This leads me to think that part of PSM-ing helps a human function day-to-day. (Talking through, remembering, clarifying thoughts.)

I wish I understood better whether ‘modeling’ meant a self-‘styling’, self-‘bending’, self-‘constructing’ vs just trying to represent yourself as you are, ‘the plain picture’ [[in Bob Dylan’s meaning|https://youtu.be/mnl5X5MQKTg?t=104]]. Maybe it’s all of it, somewhere between, or simply not possible. Are we modeling fictional characters or not? Does it matter?

<<<
    h0p3:
    Why do you have sites like yours on the web, what are they for? What is anything for?
<<<

To me, it’s the same - I act as conduit for discovering wonderful things. To me, wonderful things and wonderful people make life worth living. (How do I know if it’s ‘wonderful’? — Because it makes my life worth living.) (//To prevent you from asking me to clarify - it ends there - an instinctive feeling of simply ‘this is worth it to me’//.)

    h0p3:
    You have the chance to reason about whether or not I’m trying to do the best I can with my pile of puke.
<<<

Hahah! We’re all standing around examining each other’s sick. I like this interpretation. I think that if people could begin with this image, use it as the basis for their consensus, they can admirably proceed with the dialectic. There’s a lot less picking things apart if you cut the whole conversation some slack. (//But I’m also glad that you asked me to clarify - and that you dug into the response - sure, why not? It’s all doodoo - but still worth rooting in, on the chance of some swallowed gems…//)

    h0p3:
    […] my wiki allows me to re-use my data to understand what is salient in the world (including myself).

This is a great point! I forget that you are already employing a lot of self-editing and self-curating. (And what you do with us - making a tiddler for Sphygmus that curates her, in a way.) So this is starting to lead into my next prompt, what you refer to here as ‘the chain’ (but which I also think of as hypertext ‘layers’)… let me think how to articulate this and I’ll get back to you. ‘Soup to nuts’ is one way of putting it, but it’s imprecise, it’s not just a linear progression toward ‘the end’ - or it doesn’t have to be, I guess.

<<<
    h0p3:
    I keep almost mindlessly answering: 42 or 42ness, which is almost vacuously true, but I’m still not showing my work well enough to you.

I think this is probably your most useful analogy to helping me comprehend self-modeling. This goes in the final.

An adequate shorthand to describe you, your wiki, your work there. I feel like the phrase was an attempt to wrap all of that up into a shorter name so that you can refer to it briefly - and perhaps so people can understand from a glimpse. Or even so you can understand or remind yourself of what you are doing.

So, my first question is just to look at the phrase again. Seems like a good starting point. Is it that to you? Where does it function today?<<footnote "k:[1]" "As additional material - ‘public self-modeling’ is a phrase that chameleon has had fun with and I’m not sure to what extent it is a meme for her or if it is quite serious or what. On the other hand, Sphygmus has [[said|https://sphygm.us/#190921%20%E2%80%93%20Log%3A%20self-representation]] a few months ago (referencing this word) that her wiki is “not an attempt to answer the question of who I am.” So, I guess I also wonder if “self-modeling” is a quest to answer who you are or if it is something else.">>

I have had a thought tho… I’m envisioning something - what if we did a groupchat for a certain range of time? Like maybe a week or maybe a month.

And we can field questions to the group, answer them in hypertext - and when we’re done, I’ll make something out of it. Yes, we sort of do this already, but I’m thinking that having a beginning and an ending and a title maybe - could be interesting.
