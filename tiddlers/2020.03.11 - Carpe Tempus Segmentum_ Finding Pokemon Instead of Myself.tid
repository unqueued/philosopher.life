title: 2020.03.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Finding Pokemon Instead of Myself

* Woke at 11
** Excellent sleep.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Offspring fucked up less, but still don't have it.
* Dialecture
* Taught my son how to buzz hair and shave.
** He did it, and he did a good job. 
*** We need to buy him razors soon.
* Cleaning
* Fireman Time!
* Set offspring onto writing.
* Bought a freezer
** Met John
*** Interesting man. I appreciate how forthcoming he is.
* Chats
** Maybe set up VC with B-word Socialist (or he's being sarcastic?). 
* Arranged the kitchen
* Rib prep
* Test run on freezer
* When my wife saw me, she jumped. For a second, she didn't know it was me. She laughed for 10 minutes. I look like a child IT pro, they say.
** I've still got it. Can make her laugh (at me) anytime. 
* Trip with wife to price out Aldis and BJs. 
** Bowl of rice
*** Lots of emergency planning at Yale. Trying to find reasonable directions to go here for her.
** She wants to continue searching. Sams and Costco to consider too.
* Son worked on his paperwork with me at the table.
* I mixed a drink, and my wife liked it enough she took it, lol. Good.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Ribs, wedges, and asparagus
** Daughter and I played [[MTG]], [[k0sh3k]] and [[1uxb0x]] played beside us.
** Maymays galore
* Lenten reading and discussion.
** I usually quietly stray, but not tonight.
** There are few who could weave with me like my wife. My disagreement runs so deep in some places, and yet our agreement on the core gives us the chance to inspect these [[gems]] from constructively distinct angles with our offspring.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** I'm hoping that two years from now, my son will be speaking more to me directly through our [[Review]] channel than even my daughter atm.
* Hugged everyone to bed
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2:30
