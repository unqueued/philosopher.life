title: 2017.12.12 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Best Friend as Stranger

!! Write about your best friend as if they were a stranger.

As you know, I've long had difficulties defining the concept of "friend." It's a serious philosophical problem for me. Let me also say, it is clear that my wife is clearly my best friend. But, when a lot people say "best friend" they mean, other than one's spouse. That doesn't seem right to me. I feel forced to always add caveats in this arena.

How would I describe my wife as if she were a stranger to me? Hrmm...That is so odd because it fails to capture who I really take her to be. Her little ticks, patterns, tendencies, desires, personality, dispositions, and her identity are very rich for me. I know her. She is deeply embedded in my memory and my gutteral reactions to the world. Stripping her of these attributes takes away the very person I love (and arguably myself as well). You are asking me to describe this human as someone that I don't deeply love.

In what way would she be a stranger to me? There are lots of people who take my wife to be a stranger in various contexts, and I think she appears to be at least a slightly different person in each of these contexts (as is only natural for all of us). Furthermore, are you asking me to describe her without depth (as though she is only a stranger) or to describe how someone else might come to understand her in depth? This is such a hard question to pin down, even though it appears to be a simple one at first glance.

I'm curious about the purpose of this question too.

Alright, I'll take my best shot at it. 

[[k0sh3k]] is:

* 5ft, blue-green eyed, brown curly+frizzy hair (depending on her state of enfrazzlement), 135ish lbs (and climbing ;P)
* Eccentrically dressed, generally darker color palettes often with red-based highlights, migrating and mixing between goth, granola-hippie, androgynous professional wear, and tightly-wound church-going clothing. It depends on the context, but you know it's her style when you see it.
** Going out (the only state a stranger would see her except at Wal-Mart or when she really needs to relax): she wears intellectual looking glasses, bright social war paint, loud non-metallic jewelry, generally a fancy belt, and dressy boots.
** She wields a red leather backpack/purse, and you may find her with gadgets, books, and perhaps a bag shaped like a codex filled with papers/books/etc. 
* If she is sitting (and she probably is), you probably see coffee or tea next to her.
* You know she's a librarian when you look at her.
* Her extended personal sphere is either extremely tidy or a mess. There is no in between.
* You will notice her vocabulary and puns immediately, and even simple conversations will reveal  she is a walking encyclopedia. She can usually discuss any topic with anyone anywhere. It's obvious she is dangerously well-read.
* Discussions of religion, politics, information sciences, media, and family life are extremely common. 
* She is polite, hospitable, and charitable with strangers (all bets are off when you get to know her ;P). She gets along well with everyone from a very wide variety of backgrounds, at least on a surface level. Instantly likeable. She performs well with low-empathy characters as well. 
* She's peculiar and brilliant.

Basically, she's mine, and you can't have her.<<ref "1">> (nanana boo boo)
