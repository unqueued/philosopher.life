[8:51 PM]  h0p3: You get your DnD on?
[10:05 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Man do I have a story for you.
[10:06 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Dnd went great, except, my brother lost a pet in game and instead of saying “Wow that sucks” and moving on, he now wants to suicide the character.
[10:06 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Like.....excuse me?
[11:18 AM]  h0p3: Lol
[11:18 AM]  h0p3: I don't have a strong opinion about that one.
[11:18 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m speechless tbh
[11:18 AM]  h0p3: Why do you have a strong opinion about it?
[11:19 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: So he plays a female Druid with a myriad of animals stuffed into her bag. The pet was a pseudodragon that she interacted with once or twice that also happens to share a collected consciousness with her mentor. Tldr: she decided her mentor betrayed her so she drowned him in a very cruel way, but apparently she forgot that their brains were linked so it also killed the pet.
[11:22 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Pretty much the whole table recognized what was happening, so I assumed Austin also knew.
[11:22 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I was wrong.
[11:26 AM]  h0p3: I suppose it depends on what makes the game fun for the player.
[11:26 AM]  h0p3: Unless there is more to the game than that.
[11:26 AM]  h0p3: (and, I would argue that is a reasonable possibility)
[11:28 AM]  h0p3: I have definitely quit a lot of games which I didn't find pleasurable.
[11:28 AM]  h0p3: I'm glad that I stuck through the displeasure in some of the games I've played.
[11:29 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’ve had my suspicions that he hasn’t been enjoying the game for months now. He frequently sits on his phone or some gaming system only interjecting when acknowledged but when we ask if he’s having fun, it’s always a yes.
[11:29 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I told him he was more than welcome to stop, especially after this, I just want to hear an explicit answer because it’s always hard to get those.
[11:30 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m also open to finding middle ground to rectify what went wrong but he doesn’t seem interested which is fine. I get that lol
[11:31 AM]  h0p3: I'm sorry that he hasn't been enjoying it, and I'm sorry that he doesn't feel comfortable being honest about it (and he should be).
[11:33 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: It just sucks...when someone says they’re okay, I believe them. :rolling_eyes:
[11:33 AM]  h0p3: I appreciate that your goal is to find middle ground, build bridges.
[11:33 AM]  h0p3: I think that makes you more than just a DM.
[11:35 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: No game is worth hurting someone over. It just sucks because this wasn’t a character being a character, this was a player reacting emotionally and irrationally.
[11:36 AM]  h0p3: Obviously, I'm not there in anyone's shoes, so I don't understand enough. From my perspective: very few people enjoy playing my games, especially not at the pace, intensity, and precision I want to play them. I'm not fun to play games with unless you really adore the metagame. It's not that I don't want to play games with my friends and family, but I fear my competitiveness is not useful to us. Most people end up acting emotional and irrational with me eventually when they play games with me.
[11:36 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m also uncomfortable hearing “My character just wants to kill herself.” Instead of trying to find a way to make things right.
[11:37 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I see what you mean. I feel like because I care so much about the integrity of the story, I’m less willing to bend things because of it.
[11:37 AM]  h0p3: In the end, I have to develop my relationships not through games. The integrity of my gameplay, of course, is something I care about. It's why I end up separating the two activities.
[11:39 AM]  h0p3: I'm lucky with [[JRE]] on this. We played [[Project Ascension]] together for a couple months. We have very similar interests in gaming, a heritage of similar games. It was a blast. But, I can't replicate that with almost anyone else. My wife, for example, just doesn't care for the game that I adore like my brother.
[11:40 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m glad you all were able to bond more over that. :slight_smile:
[11:45 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Being in sync with someone is a wonderful feeling, especially within an avenue like that.
[11:46 AM]  h0p3: Aye. Me too. It's nice to have a low-friction, superfun (addictively so) method for coming together, a shared goal in a pure game. To my eyes, most of my relationships, however, have to be built upon something else. And, even in the case of my brother, that bonding in the game was actually fairly minimal in a sense.
