I need a GUI file browser. Somethings I just need to do with my mouse. Dolphin is by the best tool I've ever used, and I've tried many commanders, etc. 

Setup Dolphin, and I don't know what it is, but it looks even sexier on the i3 variant than the KDE?

Working on Alsa (damn you to hell). Reading the ALSA archlinux documentation. Sound test passes...

`~/.asoundrc`

```
pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
    device 3
}
```

`alsactl kill rescan`

I have no control over volume at all, even at the application level! This is fucking crazy.
