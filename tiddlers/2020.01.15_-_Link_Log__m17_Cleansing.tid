* Think About It

**# I had little respect for a lack of transparency in the first place.
**# Hard to impeach with a constitutional crisis and a madman at the helm. With increasing executive powers and someone who doesn't respect the rule of law as a leader, you might only get one shot.
**#* Are you going to offer similar concerns about Clinton's impeachment?
**# Looked like the special prosecutor held back to me. I think you are actually happy with the outcome, lol.
**# Without decentralizing power, there is no oversight that matters. We agree only at face value here. 
**# Maybe we should eliminate or transparentize those institutions further? They are enemies of the people.
**# You have got to be shitting me. Overton window left, sure, but not even close.
