title: 2017.10.06 -- Pipefitting Log

Very slow going. Working on my wiki, making art, helping my children, and family time are too delicious and useful right now. Also, walking up the scaffold of mathematics with my children may be useful to me directly. I'd like to walk through the pipefitter book with my children to make it come alive for them.
