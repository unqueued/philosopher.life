!! Audit:

* I have not been the primary writer. This is fascinating to me. Almost everything except [[FTO]] content, programmatic work and commentary by [[j3d1h]], and some work by [[k0sh3k]] is written by me.
** I like it. It's a different flavor, I assent, I'm grateful, and it's got a special beauty. That it is the [[Family Log]] is somehow exceptionally fitting too.
* It was neat to have other people present.
** [[Sphygmus]] literally has an entry.
** My brother [[JRE]] seemed largely uninterested.
*** I find that fascinating.
* I am proud to have so many compliments for my family. This is one of my favorite practices.
* Sometimes we are overambitious.
* I am pleased that my children are healthy.
