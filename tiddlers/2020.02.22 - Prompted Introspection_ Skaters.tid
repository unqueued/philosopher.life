title: 2020.02.22 - Prompted Introspection: Skaters

!! Should skateboards be allowed on sidewalks?

??? Yes! That's often the only safe place to skate. When possible, I don't want them on the road: they might get hit by a car. I walk on the sidewalk pretty frequently, and I don't find it problematic to let the skaters go by. The kids on the skateboards aren't the nuisance. My problems are with wealthy people and reactionaries (which isn't to say I've not met skaters who fit these categories).
