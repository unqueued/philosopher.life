title: 2020.03.19 - chameleon: Working From Home

"""
[11:17 PM] h0p3: Yo, you up for VC?
[11:18 PM] chameleon: hubby will be home soon so it's a little late, unfortunately
[11:18 PM] h0p3: np, I'm sorry it got so late; been a long day
[11:18 PM] chameleon: I'm sorry ;w; busy day
[11:21 PM] h0p3: So far, everything seems to be okay here. It's interesting interacting with the society in quarantine. Everything going okay for your family in the US and fam over the pond?
[11:23 PM] chameleon: the fam seems to be okay
[11:24 PM] chameleon: the dog is happy, apparently
[11:24 PM] chameleon: lots of friends at all hours ^w^
[11:26 PM] h0p3: Aye. I suspect many people are getting to spend way more time in the same house together than usual. Seems to be a good thing in general.
[11:37 PM] chameleon: yup
[11:37 PM] chameleon: dad's working from home, as are many of my friends
[11:38 PM] h0p3: Noice.
[11:38 PM] h0p3: Is he liking it?
[11:38 PM] chameleon: I'm not sure, but I don't see why he wouldn't
[11:38 PM] h0p3: Seems hard to beat.
[11:40 PM] h0p3: Also, you should let me know if we want me to make an EDH deck to play. I don't have one, but I could make one. I think my offspring might join us in it if we did. The more the merrier. We didn't have time for magic today, but it is blissful.

[12:32 AM] chameleon: That'd be cool
