!! Audit:

* My TDLs are ridiculously brief and overgeneral.
* I think the point of my TDL is primarily to prime my brain for what I want to do the next day. TDL is {[[Focus]]} on short-term {[[Dreams]]} in a practical way. This is executive functioning, but it's kind of minimal.
* I hope to become a master of this. It is weird how there are certain kinds of things I'm a very good planner at (autism ftw), and then othertimes it's not even consciously available to me or I'm terrible at it when I try.
* As usual, I'm embarrassed by this log.
* Interestingly, a lot of my changed plans weren't due to me. I like when I'm not responsible for my plans not working.
** Though, in a way, I may need to become better at predicting when my plans are going to fail.
