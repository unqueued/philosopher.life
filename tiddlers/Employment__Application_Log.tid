title: Employment: Application Log

* 2019.08.09
** Interview went ridiculously brief. It didn't feel like an interview. It felt like friends introducing each other to me. Justin said he had been keeping tabs on me through my teacher, but that clearly isn't the case. Clearly, I am still highly recommended by the most important person in the room though.
** Maybe it was short because I said I didn't want to travel full time. 
** I talked about my hobbies since I was asked. I talked about [[Afterschool Teaching]] for a bit. We talked about tradeskill demographics. My grey/whitebeard must be misleading them.
** I have no idea what the outcome will be.

** Customer Server Rep
** Virtual/Work-at-Home - Customer Care
** Inside Sale/Buyer 
** Software Engineer 

* 2019.07.17
** I got contracted again, as expected. Cool!
*** Training is next month.
** I've set up an interview on the 9th of next month for the fitter union

* 2019.07.15
** Shipping/Receiver Super
** Textile Converting Business Development
** District Manager Pharmacy & Retail Ops

* 2019.07.12
** Questions:
*** On average, how long does a retinal image session last?
*** On average, how many miles are traveled each day?
*** This is temporary work. What are the odds of being contracted again, and when would that begin?
** Interview was not boring.
*** The job apparently was about "compliance" (and the man had no idea how to say it). It appears to be a mix of hunting for people to remove them from insurance under the guise of preventative care, but he could not respond to the fact that lots of the diabetics he treats cannot afford their meds.
*** He told me that it wasn't really a 200-mile radius. I'd be traveling by plane and staying overnight more than half the time according to his numbers.

* 2019.07.11
** Interview Today, Kristan, Traveling Retinal Imager
** Felt a bit scammy, but we'll see.
** Contract work, ends at the end of the year, sometimes they rehire (but sounds unlikely)
** 8 hour average (paid 8 no matter what though...hrmm), schedule given in advance, 200-mile radius!?
** $10/hour, $10/per imaging, $250/per month for gas, $1k at the end, with 1-month pay severance
*** She says to expect $100-120 a day but also said it averages to $20 an hour. Her math is clearly wrong.  
** Video training is on the 19th, then they fly me out for training in Atlanta, hand me equipment, practice, and then I'm basically on my own.
** Seeking compassionate, tech-savvy people. She walked me through how to interview given my resume, told me what they are looking for, etc. Fascinating experience.
** Unfortunately, I have little control over my reactions to eyes. I tear up very quickly.
** Second video interview tomorrow at 1pm, Duo

* 2018.11.20 - Employment: Appears Employed
** Woot!
** I was going to call my interviewer for a postmortem since I thought I pwned the interview but somehow didn't get the job. Turns out, I did get the job. She just called. I am now a paid babysitter that appears to have the chance to program however he wants. I'm going to get paid to show chillun how to reason, use computers, play games, and eat snacks. That sounds like a fine job (though I can't say younger children are my favorite to teach, I've done fine before). My children are going to enjoy it too. 
** It's not a lot of money, but it would probably be enough to float. We don't live like Spartans, but we are fairly efficient. This job is at least in the moral ballpark. I need to think about my wardrobe (well, my shelf). I have to appear respectable for the monkeys in us all.
** I'm told her Monday is the earliest I could contact Kathy (HR). We are traveling (starting today). This is likely a good thing since I enjoyed a blissful evening last night (the first since [[2018.10.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Wiff Muh Bruh]]). I'll be testing myself, and I'm already prepared to study for the test if I need.
** I should keep hunting.
** Apparently, I passed the second stage interview for the DCS position as well. Neat. I was completely convinced that I couldn't get this job either.

** Links:
*** [[Master Curriculum Vitae]]
*** [[Interviewing]]
** Post-Interview:
** Jesus. I put too much thought into this, but I'm glad I did. I need the fucking practice.
** I am overqualified for this position, but I knew that. It pays $10 an hour. I'd make enough to help us keep our head above water, but not anything more.
** I have near free reign to program here, which is what I want. Guess who is going to be taking all the chillun to the 'puter lab to get all up in the wiki, lern 'bout dem internets (thank the good lord), and listen to music/audiobooks? <---this guy. Guess who is going to make everyone freewrite, design, and introspect? Me. Wake up, chilluns!
** My goal is to automate this job in a moral way and attend to the individuals as best I can. Snacks, playtime, and games part of it. 15-20 kids (better than the 30 I've had to handle before) with possibly one helper. I gotta say, even though this glorified babysitting position pays absolute shit, this job, at least at face value, is something I find morally valuable.
** Clearly, I dazzled my interviewers with my credentials, questions, and responses. Both my interviewers told me multiple times they felt honored to have me interview for the position (man, they are going to be disappointed, lol). I'm glad they don't hate that I'm a misfit just yet (give them time!). They will be recommending me (clearly, they don't know any better). I think I'll find out next week if I got the job.
** I am able to bring my own children, but they would be in another group. That's fine with me. Spending a few hours with other children and teachers could go a very long way. Socializing without the prison would be excellent. Notions of what I'd be doing.

* 2018.10.30 - Employment: Prep
** Revision of [[Employment]]
** This is a small town, and I'm not convinced a suit is appropriate. I'm not even going to shave my beard here. I'm going to dress casual.
*** Wife helped me pick out clothes. She lightened up the ensemble and had me downgrade to nice jeans.
*** Iron
** Build a description of the After-School Program Leader Position
** Prep with [[Interviewing]]. *

* 2018.10.29 - Employment: Applying
** Applied to a church secretary position. So many evils in front of me.
*** Filled.
** Applied to an after-school program leader position.
*** I actually care about that position. I'd need to think quite a bit about how to do it well.
*** ''Immediately scheduled for an interview.''
** Applied to IT Technician position for JC
*** It's recent and only open for a bit. Interesting to know I don't have much time for applications here.
*** I'm going to bet this position is already filled, but they have to make it look like it isn't. Nepotism is rampant.
*** Very annoying application process.*

* 2018.10.23 - Employment: Resume Rework
** So, my resume needed to be reworked. I'm shotgunning, so it needs to just be general. I have no problem with my blue collar work, but I think it reflects poorly on me in front of others. It is better to say I'm a homemaker who is homeschooling his children in many contexts. I obviously enjoy learning and teaching.
** I've removed my blue collar work from my work experience, though I'm keeping it in my skills section. Not sure if this is a wise move. I've regeneralized my resume.
** Completed App:
*** Web Search Evaluator - United States
*** https://join.appen.com/

* 2018.10.22 - Employment: Setup
** My wife made [[2018.10.22 - Cover Letter: Generic Template]] for me. <3
*** I hope to use it to be spammy as fuck. I want it to cost me minutes to apply for anything.
** Setting up the tagging and voldemort considerations. I'm actually going to leave this exposed to some extent simply because I want to provide evidence to those who might not otherwise see it.
** I've been browsing for several days. I don't want to travel. It's tough. 3 months away from the house might still be best. 
*** ETSU has openings, though not for philosophy. =)

** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16735011
** I've seen these in passing for quite a while now. This is the first time I dug into it. I regret to say it, but I'm not qualified. I'm missing things they want, big ones. That's okay. I am convinced the best option, especially for long-term safety, is to become adept with working with my hands. That may be all we have.
*** When I start to become capable of prepping more effectively, preserving computation through catastrophe will be key.

* 2018.03.21 - Employment Log: Interview
** I was the second person interviewed. The other guy must have actually scored higher on the test. We talked a while before our interview. He was obviously an intelligent man who had studied for the exam (we had also talked before the last interview/exam). 
** I brought water with me to the interview. Shook hands confidently with the committee. They didn't ask any questions I wasn't prepared for; I was obviously very overprepared, but I'm glad I was. They seemed to like my answers quite a bit, although there was a worry that I was looking for something more local. Apparently, even they travel quite a bit, although the apprentices still stay in the area. My examples/stories demonstrated I had worked in the field and knew what I was doing. 
** They did eventually ask about my past (I'm glad I didn't bring a resume with me). I gave them the skinny that showed I was educated, but not stuck up about it. They felt like I had traveled quite a bit. 
** They asked if I had questions, and I came prepared. They didn't say anything terribly new other than that JATC and IBEW are partnered, and I think they see themselves more as the JATC side of things. They are obviously proud of their training. 
** I need to call the trainer up again tomorrow and make sure to set an appointment to be shown around, meet other students, etc.
** They don't make decisions about apprentices until July. The marks they gave me in the interview, combined, is what ranks me on their list of candidates to choose from. They take from 10 to 25 apprentices each year, on average, they said. The list is currently 30-40 long right now. I think I did well in my interview, so I think there is a non-trivial chance I will be offered a position. Until then, they said, they might call me up to do indentured work which eventually counts towards my apprenticeship training.

* 2018.03.20 - Employment Log: Prep
** I went through [[Interviewing]] and my [[Polymath Craftsman Log]] to come up with good answers for the questions they'd be asking me. I mentally prepared myself for the encounter. I find it hard to come up with stories to tell people, but alongside my wife and reading the stories I told myself in my pipefitting logs, I was able to cobble something together.

* 2018.03.09 - Employment Log: Grind
** Glassdoor
*** No need to sign this. It looks like I'm seeing roughly the same jobs everywhere. Some of these just present it differently. I'm fine with that though. Might as well hit them all.
** I went through the local governmental work systems as well. I clearly need to find a modular resume format that looks clean. Ugh. =(

* 2018.02.20 - Employment Log: Jumping In
** Finding jobs is my job, and it always will be. My occupation isn't simply a single thing. I can see that I will need to constantly be on the lookout. My tools must always be sharp, regularly used, and working on the next thing. This will not be an accident. Success will require constant force.
** I'm cleaning up the Employment Log page. I'm structuring it. I want it to be a pristine laboratory. Let's fill it with the objects we need and make it a home worth living in.
** I'm not going to list all the major changes I'm making because it is happening to rapidly right now.
** I am sad to see how much networking is truly the key to this. I am not surprised. I do not have that option, I believe.

* 2018.02.09 - Job Hunting Log: Sad
** Talked to the union. The secretary doesn't know anything, but the coordinator does. I'll try talking to him. This is the third union I'm trying to join. I'll see on Monday. I should have my doubts, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try. I need to think of this as a war where I will lose a thousand battles, perhaps even a war that I believe I will lose, but I must still try.
** Speaking of: I went to Dr. Young in person. He said the position was filled. It isn't on the site (and they removed others). I think he was white-lying to me. I will take that signal seriously. At this point, I dare not endanger my wife's social capital or status. We need her job.

* 2018.02.07 - Job Hunting Log: Brief
** Lots of work on Craigslist. I setup an account, and I'm building searches. There are jobs to apply to, so I'm pleased to see that. I think I'll always keep looking. With an automated process setup, it's not painful to check.
** I also ran my automated checks. Nothing new. Craigslist has a lot. I'll keep working it. I need to dive in tomorrow.
