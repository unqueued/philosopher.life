** Youtube conversion didn't work for me.
** DRM hiccups on Spotify, but it works.
** Not much overlap. 
*** Generational gap. Some throwbacks for me in here. Understandably isolated to a particular time period, and that's generally true of my list.
*** Plenty I've never heard in this list too.
** Lyrically heavy, fairly consistent aesthetic (imho). Smooth AF. Probably better while high (like all music).
** Love Will Tear Us Apart, Juicy, Born on the Bayou, I Feel Free, and obviously More Than a Feeling
