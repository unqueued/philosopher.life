title: 2020.02.03 - Prompted Introspection: Primacy of Hearing

!! I wish I could hear......

Hrm. I'm surprised by my initial thoughts to this question. I usually consider my sight to be the most important standard sense, by miles. And, it's true, if I could only have one, I would choose sight all day, erry day. But, when it comes to wishes, and setting aside the metaphor of vision, and setting aside extending vision to its physical conceptual limits, the ability to practically see whatever I want to see is //not// more valuable to me than the ability to //hear// whatever I would want to hear. There so many people and so much [[Music]] that would ultimately outweigh the sights. Don't get me wrong, there's so much I want to see. I'm just surprised by my answer.
