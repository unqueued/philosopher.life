title: ARAM: Lux

Velkoz is a shitty version of Lux, but even a shitty version of Lux is strong on ARAM. I very much like the placestyle. His Ult is literally the weakest part of his kit. 

* Summoners
** Clarity - Superior mana whore spammer. You know I love it.
** Flash
* Build
** Items
*** Start
**** Catalyst of Aeons
**** Refillable Potion
*** General Build
**** Rod of Ages - She's backline, and she lasts forever with this item. Morello's is also tantalizing as first item. Clarity allows you to wait.
**** Morellonomicon - Staple for spammer. So amazing on her, you buy before your boots. You want to snowball hard.
**** Sorcerer's Shoes - Because MR is always there.
**** Ardent Censor - Those who can abuse this item should. It's so incredibly price efficient and effective in ARAM. Spam that W. Not enough people use it. You will often use it on cooldown.
**** Banshee's Veil or Zhonya's Hourglass - 10% CDR, AP, Mitigation Stat, and a Defensive ability. It rounds you out. 
**** Rabadon's Deathcap or Void Staff-- You have a shit of AP. Might as well make it worthwhile.
