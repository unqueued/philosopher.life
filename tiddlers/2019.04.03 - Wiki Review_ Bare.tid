* [[2019.04.02 - Afterschool Teaching: Meh]]
** Perhaps I just need to be even quieter.
* [[2019.04.02 - Wiki Review: Tone]]
** I wonder if there is a collection of tones out there already. It might be worth studying. 
*** I think [[1uxb0x]] may find it exceptionally valuable some day.
* [[2019.04.02 - Wiki Audit: Accumulators]]
** Edited.
** It's really cool to see some of the work normally done by hand being automated.
* [[2019.04.02 - TDL: Closets]]
** Oh, new idea. I used to have one, but I can't find it. PCIE extender cable!
* [[2019.04.02 - Prompted Introspection: Female Donor Happiness]]
** Well, I need to try to move on. 
* [[2019.04.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Brunch]]
** Completed.
** I desperately needed that nap. I've been exhausted.
