title: 2018.09.27 - JRE: Catching Up

Called my brother as soon as he got off work.

His fridge died. Food was gone with it too. Suuuuuucckksss. I have been there. =/ The hurricane in NO that hit us took power out for weeks, and we had very little money. It was not fun. He bought a new one and it will be there Saturday.

He's had mixed feelings about Raylan, who was super nice to him recently. It sounds painful. The boy is clearly important to him.

He's feeling obliged (in a good way) to help Rebecca's mom. He'll be taking time off work to do so. He says he doesn't really connect with her on anything, but her attempts at gift-giving mean a lot to him compared to our donors. She actually thinks about him in her gifts. I like that. He continued to make excuses for our donors, though he did say again I have nothing to gain by reaching out to them. I am interested in his Tit-for-X reasoning.

He told me a wonderful story about rebuilding his porn collection. I can understand why he lost his appetite.

My brother talked about his work. He's worked with this crew before. Foreman isn't as concerned with precision as much as my brother, but they can get along. Sometimes I see us as Hebrews in Egypt, but with far more luxury. My brother has enormous patience with people, and he gets the job done. That negotiating is ridiculously exhausting to me, and I don't know how he does it.

He saw my chat with [[K]] and immediately called him up (feeling empathic towards depressed people), [[L]] afterwards as well. I'm glad that he is connecting.

We talked about [[AIR]]'s therapy and the letter he is writing for me. 

We talked about [[T-Money]] and [[Sho|Ed&Sho]]. We thought more about their motivations and who they were. I am glad to have evidence and the friend-advisors to help me reason when mine fails me.

We talked about his woodworking, buying tools and wood, and the sleds he's going to make. I so wish I could be there with him to be his shopmate/helper. It sounds really fun! Also, I hope it will be a constructive, useful, and important outlet for him. I worry he is going to try to spend his way out of his pain rather than using his resources to resolve rather than ignore. I know that toolporn thing. What's different, however, is my brother is actually doing something! That doesn't rule out my worry though, but it dampens it.

He's reading books more. We talked about Woodward's book, and he had some similar worries to mine (so, I feel more confident in my worries; confirm my bias, please). He's going through the Hugo winners. He also read some woodworking books a bit ago too. He's been reading, and that is a big change in my brother. He stopped for a long time. I think this is a very good sign. If you lack curiosity, then it's an epistemic-reward signal that the risk of learning is too painful to you. I hope he takes this opportunity to study what matters most.

He had to go before I could talk about [[Sphygmus]]' and [[kickscondor]]'s CSS fragment signature idea (which I think is pretty novel; I can't recall seeing anything quite like it before).

I forgot to ask him about his timelining. I will continue to encourage him to write.
