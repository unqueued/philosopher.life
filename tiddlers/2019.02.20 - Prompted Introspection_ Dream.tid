title: 2019.02.20 - Prompted Introspection: Dream

!! Tell about a dream that you can remember.

Normally, I'd think this question is not valuable. I'm extremely doubtful of Jung in this space too. I did have a recent dream that was fascinating to me: [[2019.02.13 - Dream Log: Lucid Dreaming]]. I don't remember seeing anything besides darkness in the dream. Sometimes I dream I'm in my wiki too (which is also fairly dark). I do have a mind's eye for bringing up my visual structures in it. The auditory part, the me talking to myself and wrestling, the feeling of it (sometimes the anxiety) is there.

I don't know if there is any value in it besides curiosity. I hope to find out.
