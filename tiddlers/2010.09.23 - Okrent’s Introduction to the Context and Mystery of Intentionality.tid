title: 2010.09.23 - Okrent’s Introduction to the Context and Mystery of Intentionality

Mark Okrent starts his book off describing intentionality as we intuitively know it and then he ambitiously defines what he considers to be the three major mysteries of intentionality.

Intentionality, according to Okrent, is for an “event, state or entity…to be about something, or directed toward something.”<<ref "1">> Importantly, Okrent believes that intentionality isn’t necessarily about ‘minds’ specifically. Thoughts directed towards or about something as events or states are what he wishes to talk about and not necessarily the mind. He admits that thoughts might only exist in minds, but he believes the domain of intentionality isn’t confined by the mind.

From my perspective, in order for ‘a thing to be directed towards another thing’ to be meaningful beyond billiard balls ‘moving towards’ billiard balls, I think questions of intentionality really are about minds. And, insofar as intentionality is normative, it may be that only certain sorts of minds are capable of intentionality (I do believe this). His dismissal of many causal questions concerning intentionality, especially regarding libertarian notions of the mind (and those who hold moral value to be nearly as primitive as logic), as somehow unpromising topics for philosophical inquiry is unfounded in my view.<<ref "2">>

The first mystery is how we can understand intentionality as fitting into and being defined by the physical world. Perplexingly, Okrent makes the assumption that most people are committed to physicalism. Perhaps he is only talking about his audience, on the other hand, I think it is a fair assessment to say that the majority of the people in the world do not agree with his ontological assessment of total physicality. I think it would be very unwise to assume that intentionality can or should necessarily be described or reduced to physical terminology. I hope he takes the time to address those who are not physicalists. Perhaps the arguments in the book require a charitable presupposition, something along the lines of: ‘for the sake of the argument, assume physicalism is true’.

The second mystery is what sort of a relationship an intentional object must have with the objects it is about or towards which it is directed. Okrent’s “puzzle of intentionality” 3 is especially interesting. Admittedly, I have no idea what the relationship between the intentional object and a non-extant object would look like, although I agree that an account of intentionality must be able to make sense of this (e.g. Santa Clause).

The third mystery is about what it means for intentional states to be evaluative and how intentionality is normative. I’m convinced at this point that normativity is a quagmire concept in physicalist discussions, particularly since I deny compatibilism. I wonder how or if the author is going to make sense of the word “ought” as truly being a normative, evaluative sort of claim rather than a mere descriptive one. I really don’t see how meaning can be reduced to physical terms. At the very least, he’ll need to make an ‘intention is greater than the sum of its physical parts’ sort of argument, otherwise we are just talking about things which are only temporarily escaped entropy and only appear meaningful and beautiful because the complexity of our minds is improbable in the universe.
