title: 2017.08.08 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up very early, again before the alarm. I quietly thought for 10 minutes before turning the switch off (I wait until 5:29). 
* I worked. I'm fear I'm making a terrible first impression. Learn everything you can anyways!
* Cannabliss
* Talked with the kids. I'm still trying to convey to my son how important it is to do his best. 
* Chili and GoT
* Fireman Time x 2
* Writing, talked to my wife, hugs for the kids, and then bed.
