How are you man?
MAY 6 4:03 PM
I'm at work, but it's fairly chill.
MAY 6 4:22 PM
That is good. Today was a chill day for me. Wasn't asked to do much. Wasn't expected to do much. Spent alot of time explaining my condition.
MAY 6 4:57 PM
Several guys know. They have had sugery. Several have not had the sugery but have had the condition. We have one guy out who has been out for over 4 months fixing to go into his 3rd back sugery.
MAY 6 4:58 PM
Alot of people confuse back Injuries with pulled muscles. (I was question by some why I spent so much time off)
MAY 6 4:59 PM
I reminded them I had to go to red bull rehab and then fat camp too. Buy I got kicked out for Contraband honey buns
MAY 6 4:59 PM

MAY 6 5:11 PM

How's work going?
MAY 7 7:48 PM
Hey man. Work is OK. Talking it slow. Felt some strain today to just kinda slowed down. Still kinda figuring it out. BeenGiven alot of small easy jobs as of right now. No big jobs available that aren't being worked... 2nd day down. Keep pushing till I quit. Hahah
MAY 7 8:12 PM
How are you and yours?
MAY 7 8:13 PM
Awesome. I hope they keep taking it easy on you.
MAY 7 8:13 PM
Let you feel it out and what not.
MAY 7 8:13 PM
We're doing well. Kids still aren't done with school (late as hell), so we are grinding.
MAY 7 8:14 PM
Your a monster
MAY 7 8:15 PM
Lmao
MAY 7 8:15 PM
rofl
MAY 7 8:15 PM
It's their own fault. They fucked around today instead of getting 6 solid hours of school done.
MAY 7 8:15 PM
We started late too, admittedly.
MAY 7 8:15 PM
Samantha just finished kprep testing. Where they test for like 40min in the morning then play the rest of the day for a week straight.
MAY 7 8:17 PM
Awesome.
MAY 7 8:18 PM
I find it horrible. The way they teach for the test. Freak the kids out. Blah.
MAY 7 8:19 PM
Had the kids sign a good faith contract for math that they would only use the calculator to check their answers
MAY 7 8:19 PM
Then the day of the test the teacher tells them just the use the calculator for every problem
Lol
MAY 7 8:20 PM
Lol.
MAY 7 8:20 PM
I saw one kid was handed the test to take home.
MAY 7 8:20 PM
I would progressively tie school funding to the wealth and income of their guardians.
MAY 7 8:21 PM
Cheating on testing is rampant.
MAY 7 8:21 PM
Understandably too.
MAY 7 8:22 PM
They tie school scores to funding.
MAY 7 8:22 PM
Aye.
MAY 7 8:22 PM
There is gross incentive to make higher scores.
MAY 7 8:22 PM
I had to explain that to my kid. She was confused. Untill I layed it all put in the open.

Indeed, that "people ask what you do for a living so they can calculate the level of respect to give you" is part of almost all human cultures. That was ridiculously loud and clear in Thailand.
MAY 9 6:19 PM
How deeply they would bow to you, tons of social dynamics, etc. were based on it.
MAY 9 6:19 PM
I'm not opposed to it. If you tell me you are a Nazi military commander, I'm going to think poorly of you. I think the reasons for that calculation are rarely rational, with fair intentions, or anything beyond mindless herd mentalities or pure selfishness though.
MAY 9 6:21 PM
It depends on how and why you do it.
MAY 9 6:21 PM
It is such a culture thing too. It's an ice breaker, it's a conversation piece , it is also alot if looking down on people.
MAY 9 7:08 PM
Or like, if you told. Me you were a neo natal neuro surgeon. I'd be super intimidated by you. Lol
MAY 9 7:09 PM
It's Friday MF! Lol. I had like 8 weeks of Fridays. Took a week of work to enjoy a real Friday! Hah.
