title: 2020.01.04 - Prompted Introspection: Muh Appearance

!! How do you feel about your appearance?

I have plenty to say about this topic: [[2018.03.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: My Appearance]] and [[2019.08.31 - Prompted Introspection: My Appearance]], and far more. //Appearance// is one of them fancy words I just don't rightly understand well enough. 

Appearance to whom, wrt to what contexts, and, as always: [[gfwiwcgws]]? I despise that appearance-hacking, //mere// virtue-signaling, optics, imagecrafting, and rhetoric are the only effective tools with almost all creatures I've met. You have to doubt representations (including of yourself) so deeply that you become reserved and hedged in unintuitive places and cases to even attempt to overcome your bias here. I agree that we the [[fff]] necessarily rely upon appearances, but some approaches [[aim for justice|IA2DYJ]] more than others. 

Here's the dumbest fucking part: I like appearances! I want to live in a world which isn't a market for appearances and deception, but I also want to just enjoy appearances. I think it's a luxury I shouldn't indulge in except when all other [[right]]ness conditions have been met.

My natural state is [[naked]], dick-in-hand, surfing the net with the other. Putting on clothes for me is putting on airs (unless it's cold, and then I want my onesy). How I spend my resources to affect how others perceive me is a matter of justice. [[WWDD]] is all I can see. The folks in history (and in my own encounters) I respect all the way down just didn't give a shit about most kinds of appearance so directly. 

I want the poorest and most downtrodden people I've ever met to see me as an immediate ally, a person they'd feel comfortable speaking with for random bullshit or the most important things we've ever said,<<ref "l">> and a dude who aims to judge you exclusively by what matters most. I want my Saints behind the [[VOI]] to be able to say "yup, that looks {[[about]]} [[right]] to me." I'm never going to live up to my own {[[principles]]} wisely enough.

<<footnotes "l" "Doing shopping, including getting gifts for my offspring for birthdays and Xmas, since we simply couldn't this year with the move, and we're at the Dollar Tree, and this poor old lady just walks right up to tell my wife and her story with items in her basket. THAT is the appearance I aim to cultivate. This lady who was talking to herself felt happy to talk with me too.">>
