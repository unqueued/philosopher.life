[8:48 PM] chameleon: trying to scare me off, are we? :wink:
[8:48 PM] h0p3: No.
[8:48 PM] chameleon: I actually had some p good answers, lol
[8:49 PM] h0p3: Aye. I agree. Those are some thoughtful responses.
[8:53 PM] chameleon: by the way
[8:53 PM] chameleon: I noticed a while ago you gave death of robinhood a phone call
[8:53 PM] h0p3: Yup
[8:53 PM] h0p3: I need to call him again
[8:53 PM] chameleon: we could probably do that some time. discord voice works p nicely. not now tho lol
[8:54 PM] h0p3: I don't want to call him too early because he needs to get home (it's super cold up there).
[8:54 PM] h0p3: Yeah, that would be awesome.
[8:57 PM] chameleon: https://wiki.waifu.haus/#%40%3A%20hypertext%202020 here's my thoughts on your most recent questions
[9:07 PM] h0p3: Gracias! My tooling didn't show the change until just a bit ago.

[12:59 AM] h0p3: So, as I've said before, I am going to protect your identity. The meat-memory qualifier is something I want to look at closely with you.
[1:00 AM] h0p3: To me, that assumes that my own computer systems cannot be trusted, which I think is totally fair. Insulating yourself against me being hacked is a reasonable precaution.
[1:03 AM] h0p3: If that's the case though, then I think you should not transmit anything to my computers which meet that meat-memory qualification.
[1:05 AM] chameleon: hmm
[1:05 AM] chameleon: it's more like, if i tell you something over voice, you remember it, y'know
[1:05 AM] chameleon: it doesn't go on the wiki or w/e
[1:06 AM] h0p3: Right, I totally get that.
[1:11 AM] h0p3: There's a difference between it going on the wiki and being in some private file on my computer. Like, I have DeathOfRobinhood's phone number on my device, and it's infeasible for me to commit all that kind of information to memory (which is why I have a device for it). It's private, and I do my best to protect my devices, but it's not the same as the safety of meat-memory.
[1:12 AM] h0p3: (sorry, I'm a stickler, but I aim to abide by exactly what you are asking for)
[1:16 AM] h0p3: Anyway, just something to think about. I aim to exercise the best judgment I have for you.
[1:21 AM] chameleon: hey, thanks c:
