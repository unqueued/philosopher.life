title: Poem: I am the very model of a self-recursive modeler

https://putanumonit.com/2018/08/28/very-model/

```
I am the very model of a self-recursive modeler
My consciousness encompasses itself in many meta layers

To Russel’s paradox, I have the set of all the answers
I cut the hair of all the non-self-barbering hairdressers

I think about me thinking of my thoughts with regularity
In my Cartesian theater, I see myself with clarity

I tell you that I lie without the slightest contradiction
The story of my life is told in meta-metafiction

My inner simulator replicates the total universe
I simulate myself as I am writing out this line of verse

My secrets are unknown to me, I keep them confidential
Referring to myself I’d say I’m quite self-referential

My strange loop’s Escherer than yours, it’s Bacher and it’s Godeler
I am the very model of a self-recursive modeler
