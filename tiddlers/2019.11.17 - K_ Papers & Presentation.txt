Nov 17, 2019 5:41pm
Hey! Been sick all weekend. That sucked. But relaxing was very nice. I have to catch up on this presentation now though. 

How are you guys?
Nov 17, 2019 6:00pm
`/salute`. I hope you feel better and keep your head above water.
Nov 17, 2019 6:00pm
We're doing well. Family Time, [[j3d1h]] is at youth group (last time they'll see her at such a meeting), then we'll finish Family Time. 
Nov 17, 2019 6:01pm
Lots of reading and discussion today. 
Nov 17, 2019 6:01pm
Favorite line from my son this week: "My sister, she did much for me, I owe her much. We are like one of those super-duper close sibling relationships, with like, secret languages, always knowing what we mean and stuff. But we actually just know nothing and derp around."
Nov 17, 2019 6:03pm
We're getting there. My goal this week is to work super hard.
Nov 17, 2019 6:03pm
lol
Nov 17, 2019 6:03pm
Truer words have never been spoken
Nov 17, 2019 6:03pm
So far this presentation sucks. Instead of forming my own topic, I was assigned one, and it's not particularly compelling
Nov 17, 2019 6:04pm
There's plenty of content, just not a lot of room for analysis
Nov 17, 2019 6:04pm
The main character of Snow is an atheist that wants to believe in God, but feels like doing so would make him unintelligent. My presentation is supposed to analyze conversations he has with religious figures in the book to show how he grapples with that problem
Nov 17, 2019 6:05pm
The answer: He grapples. Lmao
Nov 17, 2019 6:06pm
Preach, yo!
Nov 17, 2019 6:06pm
Wrestling with God and Wandering the Desert are fundamental existential analogies for me.
Nov 17, 2019 6:06pm
It is no accident that Plato was a legitimate wrestler (even his name implies it), and it's how the dialectic is sometimes discussed.
Nov 17, 2019 6:07pm
Same for Jacob/Israel.
Nov 17, 2019 6:07pm
Many Eastern philosophies are attached to a martial art or a strategic stance in various contexts.
Nov 17, 2019 6:08pm
Islam is submission, a word I often associate with wrestling. 
Nov 17, 2019 6:08pm
Grappling is dialectical. 
Nov 17, 2019 6:10pm
MMA is a fascinating demonstration of which martial arts are actually the most viable. Wrestling continues to be the best foundation for all the others. Division A wrestlers, Sambo, BJJ, etc. have the work ethic to climb the mountain ranges of the other practices with a kind of virtue.
Nov 17, 2019 6:12pm
Pure strikers are never as good in the end, and pure submission specialists tend to perform poorly as well.
Nov 17, 2019 6:13pm
Yeah,  I feel like another big component of Ka's (the MC) struggle is that submitting to Islam means that your actions are ultimately held accountable by a higher power, something that no secular intellectual (my professor's words to describe him) would want.
Nov 17, 2019 6:14pm
Man I haven't seen an MMA fight in years
Nov 17, 2019 6:14pm
Most secular* intellectuals, I agree.
Nov 17, 2019 6:14pm
Accountability and justice can be peeled apart.
Nov 17, 2019 6:15pm
Hyperbole on my part haha
Nov 17, 2019 6:15pm
True, and while this struggle is a big component of his character, I still don't feel like the novel really spends enough time developing it for it to matter in the end
Nov 17, 2019 6:17pm
The focus is on other things
Nov 17, 2019 6:17pm
This is my last full week of school too, yikes.
Nov 17, 2019 6:21pm
Extremely exciting
Nov 17, 2019 6:21pm
It's time to get some shit done
Nov 17, 2019 6:22pm
I wish you luck, sir. Crunchtime.
Nov 17, 2019 6:23pm
How goes the moving transition?
Nov 17, 2019 6:23pm
That's exciting too :)
Nov 17, 2019 6:24pm
Still working it out. I'm glad we have started the process fairly early.
Nov 17, 2019 6:28pm
Same. Moving is stressful. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Nov 17, 2019 6:33pm
Have a good day!
Nov 19, 2019 9:45am
You too!
Nov 19, 2019 10:18am
You hanging in there? Feeling any better?
Nov 19, 2019 10:18am
Still feeling the remnants of the sickness. Work and school and my final presentation today.
Nov 19, 2019 10:46am

How'd the presentation go?
Nov 20, 2019 2:22pm
It went well. The best part was the end of class when she said “by the way you have a research paper due next Tuesday.”
Nov 20, 2019 3:25pm
Hahahahaha
Nov 20, 2019 3:26pm
Lol. Shux.
Nov 20, 2019 3:58pm
Yeah. It shux a lot.
Nov 20, 2019 4:39pm
How are you guys doing today?
Nov 20, 2019 4:39pm
Grinding along. Still working on how we're moving. Lots of school today. Writing too.
Nov 20, 2019 4:41pm
Sounds good!

I’m about 6 pages into a 10-12 page paper now. The current goal is to finish the rough draft tomorrow then focus on the other research paper.
