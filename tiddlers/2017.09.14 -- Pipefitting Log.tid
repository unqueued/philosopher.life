title: 2017.09.14 -- Pipefitting Log

Barely made it on time, and still second to last bus. 

Worked on bent pipe. Big stuff. I need to learn it, clearly.

Also, Chris-M showed me some math tricks in our book.

I helped Greg, Chris, and David fitup the bent pipe. Very odd rotating flanges, and didn't appear to be lapjoint. I could be wrong though.

!! Break!

The deadblow hammer rocked. No marks and plenty of force.

We put together the bent pipe. I then looked at the drawings after asking for them. I saw it was built incorrectly. It took 3 gentle tries to convince David, buy hr eventually saw it. We took it apart. Sadly, the riggers and QC were just arriving because they thought we were done. Turns out, our torque spec was wrong too. Ouch. Not my fault, thankfully.

White goo sprayed from the machines like semen. It was an accident. It turned out to be water and acetic acid. I got drenched. Chaos ensued.

Greg said this is an unsafe clusterfuck, and if he had another job lined up he would drag up.

He was right. We had a near miss with a giant piece of pipe and the crane. It was wet and the nylon chokers slipped. 

Oiled up a bunch of nuts on all the tie in points around 291 and 290.

The stainless angle I found yesterday made a great tool. Since it was trash, I cut a piece off to make a tool for myself. I want a small one too.

I need a blue tooth keyboard.

!! Lunch!

Kroiled.

I also found anbolt for an alignment dog. I cleaned the stainless angle up as well.

I found our mark on the bottom of the header for the threadolet. I helped cut it. I helped prep the piece.

I need to think about how to build the pulldog and the doghouse for the tripod. I will finish those up in the next two months.

!! Break!

I cleaned up some bolts with nuts I found for my alignment dogs. 

I cleaned the area, and I watched the superintendents attempt a fitup to the header for a couple hours. /yawn.
