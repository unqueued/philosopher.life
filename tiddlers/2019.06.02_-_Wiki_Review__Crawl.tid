title: 2019.06.02 - Wiki Review: Crawl

* [[Rick and Morty Comics]]
** I'm having fun. I had no idea what to expect.
* [[2019.06.01 - Wiki Review: Sleep Focused]]
** And, I have to stop eating fats. 
* [[2019.06.01 - TDL: Family Time]]
** It turned out to be an insanely hard evening. =(
* [[2019.06.01 - Prompted Introspection: Sins of Our Forefathers]]
** Yeah, that's roughly me too. There are key differences, but I think most of my timelines go that direction.
* [[2019.06.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Good Sleep]]
** Pit of my stomach.
* [[2019.06.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Reindeer Games]]
** But, as usual, I do not predict success.
* [[2019.06.01 - Wiki Audit: Savetrail]]
** I may end up killing off this particular sync. Ugh. That is another method I'd lose.
* [[2019.05 - Wiki Review]]
** This has been a rough month. I am glad to have survived.
* [[2019.05 - TDL]]
** And, yet, everything feels like it's falling apart.
* [[2019.05 - Prompted Introspection]]
** It continues to be an insanely emotional log for me.
* [[2019.05 - Link Log]]
** I'm glad to point. I prefer to have something great to say, but sometimes I don't know what to say.
* [[2019.05 - Family Log]]
** Remember: you plant 100 seeds, and you'll be happy for 1 to sprout.
* [[2019.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** Shitty doesn't begin to cover it. They would much better off with an entirely different man.
* [[2019.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis]]
** These are more tentpegs than wrestling. I sink them as deeply as I can with what I have.
* [[2019.05 - Afterschool Teaching]]
** I'm grateful for the opportunity. I can't say I did much with it. Perhaps I will see this log again sometime.
