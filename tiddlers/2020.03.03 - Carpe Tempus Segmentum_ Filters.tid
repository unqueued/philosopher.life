title: 2020.03.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Filters

* Woke at 11
* Meditation, vits+meds, and a giant shit (so proud).
* Yet another rough morning. Fuck.
* Dialectures
* Son's Bob is sorted.
** I'm grateful that he doesn't want to move to single-file. He's gonna try to make it work.
*** I've never been able to have him live in just a commandline before. It was my daughter's punishment for a while. Never fit him.
** NaN-attack showed up for him (had two problems). Git-backup saved us.
*** Walked with him through my approaches (all of which have had their uses). It's just non-obvious how to do it right.
* Bliss
* [[h0p3ful Review]] was solid. We had a lot to think about.
** I am grateful that we can do this.
* Landlord stopped by to hand us filters. 
** There she barely speaks English (by appearance), I'm 98% sure she has figured out that I'm retarded. It's pretty obvious. I will do my best not to remove all doubt.
* Offspring and I swapped filters out and talked about organization downstairs.
* [[The Lightning Thief]]: Chapter 3
** Talked about our papers, note-taking and drafting strategies. Pans in a fire.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
** Also, I've been minimizing my laundry well. I like it. 
* Pasta, salad, fruit
* Son was super hungry today. Far more than usual.
** He really dug the pasta today. Cool. Must practice with him. 
* [[Psyching]]: Behavioral Evolution. 
** Annoying my offspring by how often we have to pause. There's too much to talk about here. I need to try to limit it. 
*** Yeah, but, think about how many shows and books have come alive for your offspring because you took this time. Elephant's foot, sir.
**** They have to make the call. Team effort.
