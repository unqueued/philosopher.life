title: Learned Helplessness

Learned helplessness is a condition in which a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness arising from a traumatic event or persistent failure to succeed.<<ref "1">> It's linked to depression, inferiority complex, and addiction.

A suffering animal will eventually stop calling for help when no one comes. It learns that it has no control over its environment.

Nobody is going to help you except yourself. Get up and do it. That doesn't mean you will succeed, but you should try anyways. Even if nobody is intelligent, empathic, or idiosyncratic enough to get it, it is your job to get it. Even if your suffering isn't your fault, it is your job to try and fix it. 

Don't merely feel like a passenger in your own life. There is no freedom there. You must shape yourself. You must fight.

<<footnotes "1" "Of course, a psychopathic Randian would accuse a victim of being at fault here. That's absurd. Learned helplessness in society may be real, but that doesn't mean that conditioning is their fault.">>
