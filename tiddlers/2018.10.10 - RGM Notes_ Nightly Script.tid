title: 2018.10.10 - RGM Notes: Nightly Script

//One of the goals of this script is to eliminate heavy JS usage and maximize the "just a bunch of links" self-integration. Clients should have maximum performance and little to compute. I want to keep TW as static as possible. I hope to minimize the size of this wiki file and the computation necessary to use it, though some features, like search, really require dynamic work.//

# Begin logfile
# Close FF
# Initial backup
# Create stage
# Decompile
# Tagging
#* If "Titletag:" then make sure it is tagged "Titletag" as well.
# Hardlink insertions
#* Converting automated lists into hardcoded ones
#** Perhaps scraped out of the browser post-rendering, roflmao.
#* In dated material, YYYY.MM.DD, I'm fine with all keywords being automatically replaced with links. It is better to overlink rather than under. Unfortunately, there is a lot of room to screw up here. I need to think about the implications here.
#** At the very least, names in [[FTO]] can always be linked.
# Wiki Tag and Title Resets?
#* I want to be able to change a Tiddler's Title and automatically have all links in the wiki automatically adjusted. This will require some serious thought.
#* Not sure if I change title if I should remove the old tags?
# dotfile overwrites
# Sanitization (need an exceptions file)
# Internal signature
# Recompile
# Cleanup stage
# Snapshots
# Distribution
# Open FF
