title: 2018.10.23 - Prompted Introspection: Ideal Presidential Candidate

!! Who is your ideal presidential candidate?

There are many similar questions I've answered here:

* [[2018.01.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Ideal President]]
* [[2018.04.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: If I Were President]]
* [[2018.08.10 - Prompted Introspection: Assassinated on Saturday]]

The ideal presidential candidate would be someone who can gaslitically appear to favor the aristocracy enough to actually get elected and then turn around to decentralize power as much as possible. There are profound limits on the powers of presidents, though there is clearly an increase in executive power over the past few decades.

That is the practical ideal, I guess? It's not very practical though, but the ideal never is.
