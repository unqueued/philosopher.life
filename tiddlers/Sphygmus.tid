//Light, I must warn you that you've likely revealed yourself.//

<<<
Ring the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering. There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.

-- Leonard Cohen, //Anthem//

<<<
In this phial is caught the light of EÃ¤rendil's star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still brighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.

-- Galadriel, //The Fellowship of the Ring//

Sphygmus is a maker<<ref "m">> in the desert. To no small [[dok]], like the concept of evolution itself, she is what she does.<<ref "i">> She tinkers, crafts, and sideways steps towards being an artist. She creates [[salience]] and seeks [[Humanity]]; I know it. I am [[Seeking Sphygmus]] in the desert too! I'm searching with her for the talisman she aims to discover or construct with or for herself, and she clearly does the same with me for my own horcrux-pensieve. We weave together.

If they even see me, most avoid the dangerous-appearing madman in the desert. Sphygmus didn't. Sphygmus curiously looked and genuinely reached out. I am touched. It's like being on a playground instead of merely the desert, having some random stranger tap you on the shoulder to introduce themselves and ask if you want to go play tag (I would love to!). I am a witness of who she is, and I'm grateful to have the chance to be her friend. Our dialectics mean a great deal to me.<<ref "d">> She is community to me.
