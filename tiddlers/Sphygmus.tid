//Light,<<ref "p">> I am grateful for your sincere gift of revealing yourself.//

Ring the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering. There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.

<<<
In this phial is caught the light of Eärendil's star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still brighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.

-- Galadriel, //The Fellowship of the Ring//

Madame ᛝSphygmusᛝ פימברתיל פטריכור the Fire Maker<<ref "m">> is a modeler, designer, dreamer, artist, computer geek, and philosopher. Lacking a more precise+concise term, I call her a maker because she makes a wide range of things between the meaningfully pragmatic and the [[irwartfrr]]ly esoteric. Even with a strong and flexible voice, she's anxiously kind. She is a reminder to me that reality is wonderfully stranger than fiction.

She lives in many places with many people. I never understand it well enough, but she is finding her placeness across the world. She is a fantastic host, and I am her clumsy guest. She reminds me of a cross between a gentle elf and a shy ent from the hilly forest come to speak with an imbalanced and indelicate desert madman. She bakes existential Lembas, rains mana, and breaks our fast together by the light of the fire. Of course, she speaks high elvish and forest elvish. I can barely grunt in her languages, however, which is embarrassing considering how she blargles so [[beautiful]]ly with me. Too often, I am a slow learner. I do not understand the elegance of her constructions, but I [[fff]]ingly love and like them.

To no small [[dok]], like the concept of evolution itself, she is what she does.<<ref "i">> She tinkers and crafts the world around her. She creates [[salience]] and seeks [[Humanity]]; I know it. However autistically, I am [[Seeking Sphygmus]] in the desert too! I'm searching with her for the talisman she aims to discover or construct with or for herself, and she clearly does the same with me for my own horcrux-pensieve. We weave together.

If they even see me, most avoid the madman in the desert. Sphygmus didn't. Sphygmus curiously looked and genuinely reached out. I am touched. It's like being on a playground instead of merely the desert, having some random stranger tap you on the shoulder to introduce themselves and ask if you want to go play tag (I would love to!). I am a witness of who she is, and I'm grateful to have the chance to be her friend. Our dialectics mean a great deal to me.<<ref "d">> She is community to me. I am lucky to have such a [[good]] person in my life, and I [[hope]] to do the same.
