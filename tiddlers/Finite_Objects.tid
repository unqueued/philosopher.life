title: Finite Objects

//Dedicated to Saint Leibniz.//

# There is an uncountably infinite number of finite objects.
#* Necessary objects are modes of the same [[Infinite]] object, [[The Good]]. 
#* Contingent objects are not [[The Good]]; they are other.
# There is a reason for every object.
#* [[The Infinite]] is its own self-justifying reason.
# Contingent objects can only be identified, perceived, understood, or exist in virtue of their properties related to [[The Infinite]].
#* Presumably an infinite number of relationships and hence infinite properties. What does it mean for a finite object to have infinite anything?
#* To describe one contingent object fully appears to imply a description of everything.
#* Non-qualiatic objects can be fully described via an agglomerative description from all possible perspectives.
#* Qualiatic objects are reducible to reality seen from a particular point of view.
