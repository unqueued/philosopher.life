title: 2017.02.14 - Realpolitik Speculation: Automated Memetic Warfare

Cambridge Analytica may or may not be snake oil. I take it to be a reasonable possibility they legitimately contributed to Trump's victory. They appear to be a company devoted to "audience targeting" and mass-manipulation done more efficiently. Perhaps they are weaponized marketers, and it is possible they wield non-trivial influence over us. If not them in particular, then perhaps an entire industry.

We also must worry about automated propaganda filter-bubble generation and social media analytics/bots which provide significant predictions and enable not only conversations and claims to be shaped in the public sphere but even injected into our private lives. Automated astroturfing and mass behavior modification are significant weapons. The US military-industrial-complex have long worked on such projects. Targeted and mass ideology and behavioral shaping exist. There are profound technological memetic weapons wielded against humanity. 

Companies like Google shape what you see more than you likely realize. Know who "serves" you and why. Beware of Geeks bearing gifts. It is inevitable that a capitalist society will (and imho already has) enabled much darker corporate adversaries to arise (and many have been around longer than Google).

Big Brother isn't merely the state. I don't know if it ever really was either. I believe it is a much more dangerous adversary than a simple government since it is increasingly owned, used by and for, and beholden to none other than the Hyperclass. We should fear psychographic weapons which abuse our monkey-brains and keep us on an emotional leash. Automated functions which influence human beliefs, emotions, behaviors, etc. should be highly regulated, not to form an oligopoly on it, but rather to prevent abuse and mistakes that we can't take back. AI-empowered rhetoric is on the side of the Two-edged Sword of Technology we don't want to see. Transparency is key.
