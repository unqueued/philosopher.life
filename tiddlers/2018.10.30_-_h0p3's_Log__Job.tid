title: 2018.10.30 - h0p3's Log: Job

CLing the piano. Will put the Nissan up next.

Feeling like a failure with a shrinking chance of success, even after continually reframing the standard of success to my context.

Really hoping I can find a job that pays decently here soon. My brothers generously help and offer to help even further. They work really hard, and I don't want to take their labor from them unless I absolutely have to. Our money dwindles. We slowly oscillate and spiral downward. I have been [[hope]]ful many times before, and it has failed again and again. My long-term projections are ugly. I am depressed (and several people have pointed it out). Why should I think my lens is inaccurate? What is wrong with my model? I must always remember that [[The Right]] is simply painful in the vast majority of contexts; I hope it gives fitting meaning to my life. The cost of living is absurd.
