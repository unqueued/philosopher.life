title: 2019.07.04 - Prompted Introspection: Eating Habits

!! How have you adjusted your eating habits to be healthier?

I've been eating more fruits, vegetables, and nuts. My nurse practitioner says I consume way, way too much fat. A quick search of my test results shows I have a serious problem. I have a gut, and I eat fat. My blood pressure is good (I have no idea how), my heart rate is fine, I get some exercise, but I obviously binge way too hard in the evening. I give myself a space to eat whatever the hell I want in the evening, and that is a mistake.

I'm very much hoping to acquire more cannabliss, as I generally lose weight on it. Vits, cannabutter, water, tea, and coffee are also part of my ideal consumption cycle.
