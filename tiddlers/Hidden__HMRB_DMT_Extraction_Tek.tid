title: Hidden: HMRB DMT Extraction Tek

This recipe is an A/B DMT extraction from 100g HMRB. Scale your ingredients proportionally, but don't change the timing. 

Ingredients:

* 100g HMRB
* 400mL of VM&P Naphtha (no lighter fluid)
* 24g of Lye (granulated sodium hydroxide)
* 160mL Distilled Vinegar (plus additional vinegar on the side in case of Lye emergency)
* 1440mL of Distilled water

Tools:

* Grinder
* At least 2 pots
* 4 or more 100mL wide-mouthed crystallization jars (might have to scrape)
* Glass turkey baster (or glass decanter)
* Coffee filters
* Press
* Dust mask, safety goggles, and rubber gloves
* Large, sealable glass jar (800mL or more)
* A cold ass freezer

Safety:

* Naphtha is explosive. Don't be stupid.
* Lye should not be exposed to your body in any way. It also generates exothermic reactions (so watch your ass).
** Wear your fucking safety gear while handling this shit.
** Add lye slowly to prevent the heat-releasing reaction.
** Work in a tub or outside in case your container explodes.
** Have vinegar around to neutralize lye.
** Exposure will leave the skin feeling soapy and will not immediately damage the skin; wash hands thoroughly if this soapy sensation or irritation is felt.


The Procedure:

# Grind, blend, shred, and/or pulverize HMRB into powder.
#* You prefer //inner// root bark; it contains a higher percentage of DMT.
# Freeze and thaw the HMRB 3 times to induce lysis
#* Enables better DMT absorbtion.
# Mix 360mL of distilled water, 40mL of vinegar, and 100g of HMRB in a covered pot, bring to a rolling boil, then reduce to low heat. Continue the low boil for 1.5 hours, stirring every 5-10 minutes.
#* De-fat converts DMT into a 4-pH water-soluble acetate, a salt dissolved into the boiling polar solution, separating it from the plant matter and other alkaloids.
# Decant and/or strain solution with cheesecloth or coffee filter into another pot, and repeat step-3 three more times (4 times total) using new water and vinegar.
#* You hope to strain ~200mL of boiled solution from the initial 400mL, and so you hope to have ~800mL of solution after repetition.
#* Don't forget to press/squeeze the HMRB (and/or filter) into your solution before discarding the plant matter.
# Reduce the ~800mL solution to about ~240mL by low-heat boiling (for ~40 minutes)
#* Limits quantity of the following reagants needed.
# Pour the reduced solution in a sealable (and shakeable) glass jar container, and cool it in the fridge for ~2 hours.
#* Cooling will help prevent damaging the glass container during the lye's exothermic reaction.
# While using safety gear and in a tub or outside (in case container breaks), in small amounts, slowly add a total of 24g of lye to the solution in the glass container. Gently shake or stir with glass.
#* In case you are scaling this up, you can add up to 20g every 2 minutes while stirring in between.
#* Contents will change to grey and eventually black as it reaches 13-pH. Too little lye is problematic, but too much isn't.
# Double-boil the glass jar filled with the lye solution, then add 100mL of naphtha and seal the container.
# Shake vigorously for 3 minutes and then let the contents separate for 10 minutes. Repeat this step 5 times while keeping the jar contents warm. 
#* This pulls the DMT freebase into the naphtha layer. 
# Allow the naphtha layer to fully separate (takes several hours)
# Using a glass turkey baster, carefully transfer the top naphtha layer into an appropriately sized crystallization jar (wide-mouthed, so you can scrape DMT residue off the bottom). 
#* Erring on the side of caution, avoid transferring any of the black basic layers underneath in order to prevent contamination. Err on the side of caution, as it is preferable to prevent contamination by leaving the remnant of the naphtha layer.
# Place crystallization jar into an exceptionally cold freezer for 72 hours.
#* DMT is insoluble in the naphtha solution at low temperatures, where it will precipitate out. If it isn't cold enough, the DMT will dissolve back into the naphtha.
# Repeat steps 8 through 12 two more times (3 total),<<ref "1">> using new naphtha and crystallization jar for each pull repitition.
# Separate the DMT from the naphtha solution by pouring the contents of the crystallization jars through a funnel with a filter/screen. 
# Allow the extracted DMT to dry for at least ten hours. 
#* It should dry into powderized crystals or a waxy consistency based on the purity of the extraction. 
#* The remaining naphtha can be reused in later pulls, but clean naphtha is preferred.
