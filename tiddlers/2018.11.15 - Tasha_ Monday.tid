Getting ready for work gotta leave here in the next 10 minutes or so! Just spoke to Matthew he won’t be able to do Friday- but he is off Sunday Monday Tuesday! I know you would prefer not to do Sunday so I was thinking Monday would be great if you guys are free Tuesday we are doing our Thanksgiving because both Matthew and I work on thanksgiving :-1:
