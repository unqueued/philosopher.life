FRI 6:24 PM
Not bad. Stayed up too late and slept late. Unplanned but otherwise been a good day. And yours?
FRI 6:25 PM
Solid. Glad to have the weekend. Going for a benzo tonight, a rare treat for me.
FRI 6:26 PM
I've had 60mg of Valium already. Feels like I took an advil. Tolerance is annoying. =) what is your choice benzo?

FRI 6:30 PM
You do have a significant tolerance, lol.
FRI 6:32 PM
I'm aware. Most people would not be functioning. Looks like legality is a Grey area. I personally would have a tough time finding a reliable source. Granted I have access to a script. Much safer.
FRI 6:33 PM
Benzos frighten me only because I have been heavily addicted to xanx (prescribed) in the past. I made the mistake of taking large quantities everyday. (again prescribed.)
FRI 6:35 PM
Best kept as a rare treat indeed.
FRI 6:36 PM
I like to live on the edge. But I don't like a "have to have"
FRI 6:36 PM
Reading up on reddit about it. Intersting.
FRI 6:42 PM
Be safe! Lol
FRI 6:43 PM
400ug
FRI 6:43 PM
Last time I went 300ug then reuped a few hours later.
FRI 6:44 PM
I've never tried more than 600 total, but I don't want to fall asleep.
FRI 6:44 PM
I use volumetric dosing*
FRI 6:45 PM
From what I've read that is the best.
FRI 6:45 PM
It is not something I would fuck with though. I think my current tolerance would Jam up the system and I'd just end up asleep.
FRI 6:46 PM
Lol
FRI 6:46 PM
I like the all natural or fda approved. Lol
FRI 6:47 PM
But to each their own. Sounds like your dosage is concurret with other users
FRI 6:48 PM
These supplies were bought long ago. I have ~2k full blown hits. I'll never use it in my lifetime.
FRI 6:48 PM
Next time I see you, I will bring you some.
FRI 6:49 PM
(you MUST follow the instructions though)
FRI 6:49 PM
I'm good man!
FRI 6:49 PM
You can keep it. Lol
FRI 6:49 PM
Like I said. Benzo scare me.
FRI 6:49 PM
And, yet 60mg valium doesn't even put  a dent in you.
FRI 6:50 PM
How? You only use on weekends.
FRI 6:50 PM
I don't have much practice here.
FRI 6:50 PM
I've used more since I've been off. But not daily. (I get a buzz from 40-60mg but more like knock the edge off and felt like I had 2 or 3 beers)
FRI 6:53 PM
Makes my anxiety disappear.
FRI 6:53 PM
Begone anxiety: ╰(˙ᗜ˙)੭━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ
FRI 6:54 PM
But yeah. I'd get more fucked up off two tokes of cannibis
FRI 6:56 PM
Lol
FRI 6:56 PM
I'd prefer it than Valium. Makes me less lazy.
FRI 6:56 PM
Lol
FRI 6:56 PM
I'm going to have to a get a pipe to use my DMT. I've heard it is not fun to smoke it, and I can't even inhale cannabis effectively (that shit insane on my lungs and throat).
FRI 6:56 PM
Yeah, benzo is a lazy drug. I veg on it.
FRI 6:56 PM
I'm afraid to take MJ any other way than inhaling.
FRI 6:57 PM
Might get a vaporizer one day, especially after it becomes legal (lawd willing)
FRI 6:58 PM
I've had edibles. But the thc levels vary so much... I feel more in control with tokes.
FRI 6:58 PM
Yeah, my best friend uses the vape pen. He prefers it now.
FRI 6:58 PM
Just cleaner and less mess.
FRI 6:58 PM
We grew up breaking up bricks of Mexican dirt and rolling blunts.
FRI 6:59 PM
Making your own edibles will give you a lot of consistency.
FRI 7:00 PM
I've taken some from a reliable friend. Who I trusted and who could equate this much to that much.
FRI 7:04 PM
I enjoyed the edibles then. But it's all just pipe dreams for now.
FRI 7:05 PM
I hear ya.
FRI 7:05 PM
Least till I reach some short term goals and abandon all of societies expectations of success and just do my own thing.
FRI 7:07 PM
Heideggerian Authenticity
FRI 7:07 PM
BRB. Gotta Google that
FRI 7:08 PM
OK. Yes. In some sense.
FRI 7:09 PM
I see both selfish and  unselfish acts in that endevour.
FRI 7:09 PM
Kierkegaard also favors resisting society; he's far more an individualist.
FRI 7:10 PM
I definitely doesn't fit into the golden rule. But I find that the increased freedom would allow me to do things I never would have been able to before.
FRI 7:11 PM
Like take a couple of weeks off work and re roof my grandads house which is in dire need.
FRI 7:11 PM
But I'm seeing life beyond my back injury. And that is amazing. (you got to see a sad demise if my mental stability)
FRI 7:13 PM
But a part of life no less. Growing older. The injury waits behind every corner.
FRI 7:14 PM
How's that treating you? Still awake? Lol
FRI 8:54 PM
Yeah, thinking about another hit, lol.
FRI 8:54 PM
It's nice and chill.
FRI 8:55 PM
Thinking about that Radical Market book again. I very much like some of the work in it.
FRI 8:55 PM
Wish you would read it ;P
FRI 8:55 PM
That's awesome. Lol. I have the audio book. I should get around to it.
FRI 8:55 PM
Milton Friedman would adore it, imho.
FRI 8:56 PM
It's so crazy far that direction that it might even horseshoe into territory I'd consider.
FRI 8:56 PM
You think so?
FRI 8:56 PM
Most economists I've seen consider it too extreme in attempting to maximize free-markets.
FRI 8:57 PM
There's something quite beautiful about it, even if it is wrong.
FRI 8:57 PM
(which, I hate to say, I'm not in a position to say it is wrong all the way down either...some things like spot on to me)
FRI 8:58 PM
I'm afraid political corruption is the worst enemy of any of the major economic systems.
FRI 8:58 PM
Agreed.
FRI 8:59 PM
Capitolism attempts to minimize that with competition. But our buocracy has failed to be a sufficient deterrent.
FRI 8:59 PM
That and the centralization of power and capital begets capital. Exploitation and monopolies are the result of capitalism, imho.
FRI 9:00 PM
I think markets will inevitably lead to at least oligopolies.
FRI 9:00 PM
They are and will without measures to stop them
FRI 9:00 PM
It is an agreed failure of a free market.
FRI 9:00 PM
But when politicala are the deciding factor I. Who gets to merge and how competition is distributed... You get corruption. And you get America.
FRI 9:02 PM
Politicians
FRI 9:02 PM
Capitalism is that infection of politics too ;P
FRI 9:03 PM
Introduce the two party system. And viola. You habe no competition. You got trump or Hillary....
FRI 9:03 PM
Ranged Quadratic Voting
FRI 9:03 PM
Gerrymandering.
FRI 9:03 PM
Lok
FRI 9:03 PM
Lol
FRI 9:03 PM
Anyway, check the book out when you get the time.
FRI 9:04 PM
I sware at this point just give me free heathcare and legalize weed. I'll be calm enough to run for political office
FRI 9:05 PM
Lol
