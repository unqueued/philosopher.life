!! Which decade of clothing fashion was your favorite and least favorite?

I have answered this before: [[2018.02.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Fashion Decade Preferences]]. Nudity is awesome. That said, people can look awesome in clothes too. 

What's the purpose of clothing? Show me that you live a lifestyle in which you are energy-wealthy, that you have fat-deposits in all the right places, that you defeat entropy like a master animal, that you are the dialectical materialist winrar, that you can devote your life to beauty and pleasure, that you are someone we celebrate, that you shall be remembered for all time, that you earned your fame and fortune, that we wish to emulate you, that your virtue signals cause all the affective and cognitive attractions in everyone. To the higher mammals and corvids, your clothing and fashion are magnets; how do they work? You are authentic in your clothing; it's an outward expression of an inward meaningfulness. 

Your clothing demonstrates to others you care about how you appear to them enough to wear those clothes. What an expression of respect, approval-seeking, like, and love!

Oh, no, no, no, you don't understand: I would care about how I looked even if I were the only person on the planet. If I lived on an island all by myself, surely I, myself, and my volleyball would care. I'm uniquely stylish, of course.

Alright, to the question, I like that my clothes: are consistently comfortable, don't offend too many people too significantly, and can be fitted to my tasks and weather. I'm going with this decade and my own amazing fashion sense. 

What's my least favorite? Also my own fashion: I want to wear silk and soft materials. I want to wear all the fuzzy things. I want texture that isn't traditionally manly, and I want better pockets, straps, and tool-oriented designs. Take some of what I love about women's wear and what I love about construction clothing and combine them. Into ideality, I want to be a silk-daddy, KnoWhatImSayin? I despise all the decades which aren't that.
