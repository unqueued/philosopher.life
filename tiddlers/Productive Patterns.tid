title: Productive Patterns

Just Start

* Useful when you have a task that cannot wait until you have all the information about it to begin. It may be time sensitive, you may have a deadline, or part of the task may be to identify its parts, or you must generate some level of confidence about the task’s overall direction and gain an understanding as to how long they will take.
* By not starting a task, you can't know if it is completable; but you know it won't be completed if you never start.
* When faced with a vague task, assuming you won't be punished for taking initiative, start working on it to see if the steps you need to complete it emerge. Just starting a vague task can permit you to obtain the information you need to complete it.
* You can always //put it off// once you get an idea of what you need to do. 
* You can also //seek clarification// from someone if the task does not become clear after you start.


Contiguous Time Blocks

* Useful when you have the information you need to complete a task and you are determining how you will complete it. You have several other tasks you need to complete and you frequently fragment your time. You feel that you must prevent interruptions to advance this task.
* Chunking limits interruptions so that you can concentrate on a complex task within defined time periods.


Single-Task Important Items

* Useful when you have a task to do that you and/or others consider important in which performing this task simultaneously with other tasks breaks your concentration and you find that quality is suffering. 
* It's necessary when you feel that the task warrants a quality level that is impossible to produce if you perform it with other tasks.
* This is a time in which you hope to enter the flowstate.


Put It Off

* Use when you have a task to complete and you are having trouble concentrating on it either because it is complex, you are fatigued, or it is large. 
* Use when you find that you are having difficulty advancing the task or that the task itself is becoming more confusing. 
* Use when you feel you do not have a good handle on how to organize the task, its output, or both.
* Setting a problem aside gives your mind time to mull over the information it has already absorbed while you are doing other things. This takes advantage of how we rely on our subconscious to organize our thoughts and memories.
* By better organizing a task or its output, it may become easier complete.


Seek Clarification

* Use when you have a task to complete which is too vague, especially when the task may have an aggressive deadline or you feel that you cannot begin the task unless you have clear instructions or you obtain additional information.
* The amount of time taken to complete a vague task takes away from other tasks.
* Seeking clarification places the onus back on the requestor to provide you with the necessary information.
* Seeking clarification can backfire. This depends on the personality of the person who gives you the task and, in some cases, their power and authority. If the person giving a task believes you should know how to complete it, rather than gaining additional information to perform the task you will irritate them and perhaps lose their trust in your competence.


Batch the Simple Stuff

* Use when you have many tasks to complete and a number of them are relatively small, the tasks relate to each other, and you have a sense that you are not making much progress without having a block of time to invest in completing small, simple tasks. 


Task Jar

* Using a “task jar” allows you to intersperse small, well-known, non-urgent tasks between larger or more complex tasks.
* Tasks in the task jar may have an inherent or loose priority – to you or someone else – while they are in the jar.


Strike When You Are Hot

* Use when you have a task to do and need to progress through it quickly or make significant progress. You have times of the day when you feel you are more productive – times when you are at your intellectual, emotional, or physical best. To make significant progress or complete the task, you feel that you need to be at your best to maintain your focus.


Feedback Loop

* Use when you have a task and are unable to determine how long it will take to complete.  You have the information you need to begin the task, but you believe there will be additional information requirements that may emerge as you perform the task.  The task itself may be vague, but you do not require clarification.  You feel that you need some knowledge of the task’s parts to determine how long it will take to complete. 
* Completing a task in tight feedback cycles may improve the overall quality of the deliverable.
* This pattern uses the concept of gaining feedback from prior action times as a predictor of future action times. 


Prioritize

* Use when you have many tasks to complete.  These tasks can be large and complex or small and simple.  You have the information you need to decide which tasks are more important.  Each task has a different level of importance to you or someone for whom you are completing it. 


Delegate

* Use when you have a task to do for which you may not have the specific domain expertise and do not have the time to complete.  You have people reporting to you or who are willing to help you complete the task.  Others may be able to perform the task equal to or better than you. 
* Never put off for tomorrow what you can have someone else do today.


Drop Unimportant Task

* Use when you have several tasks you need to complete.  Some of these tasks are unimportant and may never need action.  The task may have been on the bottom of your list of things to do for a very long time and may no longer be required.  In addition, you may have had past experience with the requestor and can judge whether it is truly required or not.
* Use this when you are overwhelmed and you are sure that the task will make no difference to anyone. This often requires very detailed knowledge of another person’s needs.
* Good candidates for this pattern are tasks whose due dates continue to move out each time you have not completed them. A “rule of three” can be a good policy – if you miss a date three times and there is no consequence, you can probably drop the task.


Good Enough

* Use when you have several tasks you need to complete.  You know that not everything that you do has to be perfect.  You recognize that the level of quality for a task can be reduced, and still satisfy the requestor.  You may be spending time on things that add little value. 
* Time spent perfecting something that does not require perfection is time that is lost for the sake of completing other tasks.
