We got a lot of bricks, but I don't know what the building looks like.

I adore this concrete quote. I got a lot of tiddlers, but I don't know what the wiki looks like. Draper makes me feel incredibly [[fff]] with a single analogy. I feel like my life is fragmented, incompletable, and impossible for me to envision fittingly. The [[agi]] considerations are strong with this quote. This is about virtue of the practice, techne, synthesis, sublation, emergence, and instrumental reason to [[The Telos]]. I want to make it add up, but I can never know what it is supposed to add up to. I hate that all I have is the method (a poor one at that!). The virtuous perception is an art, and I am forever climbing that mountain. 

Again, I see my autistic modeling faux pas and crises here. This is epistemology and ethics snapping together. Draper isn't going to deliver us from evil, but I admire the many interpretations of this generalized antipleonasm. It's a keeper.
