title: 2018.01.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Ocean Blindness

!! Describe the ocean to a person who is blind.

Were they blind from birth or have they had vision before? Are they completely blind or legally (and practically blind)? Of course, there will always be a qualia problem that I cannot bridge for this person. The blind person who understands all there is to know about oceans, read every poem and story about them, who has felt them, etc. will still learn something upon first seeing the ocean. 

I suppose the question is really how and why should I describe the ocean to a blind person? I need more particularities. I cannot feasibly complete the moral calculus (though I ought to try, to some extent), but it is obvious that the best way to describe the ocean to a blind person is context-dependent.

There's your non-answer.
