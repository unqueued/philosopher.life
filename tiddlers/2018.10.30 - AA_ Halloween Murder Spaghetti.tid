How’s today treating you?
5 HR AGO
Been a frustrating day, hehe. Kids used a dirty towel to do the dishes and put everything away. So...we got to clean the kitchen. I think I've got the right parts to the dryer. Prepping for the interview tomorrow. [[AIR]]'s date ghosted him, so comforting him. Still working on the WoW thing; my timeline was too optimistic hehe (X-mas presents will be revamps of their PCs for gaming though, will aim for passthrough for the chillun to run Windows with full access to the GPU on top of Linux). Reading and writing hardcore as usual.
5 HR AGO
How's your day been?
5 HR AGO
Not as eventful as yours...
5 HR AGO
Feeling better. Great day at school. Waiting for people now for a meeting.
5 HR AGO
Poor [[AIR]] —that sucks
5 HR AGO
What's your meeting for?
5 HR AGO
Is he a part of any community in Louisville ?
5 HR AGO
That dude lives at his job. Not time for it.
5 HR AGO
Lifeway —leading a study session
5 HR AGO
Ah, cool.
5 HR AGO
[[UJ]]’s brother and his partner are a part of several groups — maybe something he might look into and enjoy
5 HR AGO
Good way to meet people
5 HR AGO
That is a good idea.
5 HR AGO
I am so glad I do not have to date. I was incompetent as a teenager, and I think it would be impossible/nightmarish at this age, rofl.
5 HR AGO
I know one of the groups is Derby City Sisters —they do a lot of charity stuff but have a blast doing it
5 HR AGO
I think you may have met Jacky. He and Charles were at [[L]]’s wedding
4 HR AGO
He's got some connection to drag, but I don't know what they are.
4 HR AGO
Sending link to Derby City Sisters to him

4 HR AGO
Ok
4 HR AGO
That’s it
4 HR AGO
I don't know if I did. I probably did. I don't have good recall of the wedding, only tidbits of a semblance now.
4 HR AGO
They in Louisville too?
4 HR AGO
Yes
4 HR AGO
How often do you lead study sessions?
4 HR AGO
Teach during the day, teach at night.
4 HR AGO
Every Tuesday
4 HR AGO
I like to teach what can I say
4 HR AGO
=) tru dat
4 HR AGO
The cookies don’t hurt either
4 HR AGO
Your lemon cookies are hands down the best I've ever had.
4 HR AGO
:grin: thanks!
4 HR AGO
That is but one of the many things I am going to miss by not being able to attend Thanksgiving. Thank you for inviting us. It is imperative that I see [[R]] ([[k0sh3k]]'s mom).
4 HR AGO
Should I be concerned that the drs office called to tell me that my blood tests shows I have an infection? Since the dr already gave me meds for strep?
4 HR AGO
Googling now
4 HR AGO
No problem. I understand previous commitments.
4 HR AGO
The call made me laugh —they obviously didn’t check their records
4 HR AGO
Oh, I see, Lol.
4 HR AGO
I'm going to bet they do so for legal reasons.
4 HR AGO
We shall have to make a later date and have our own holiday with cookies!
4 HR AGO
\o/
4 HR AGO
What's [[UJ]] and [[AG]] up to today?
4 HR AGO
[[AG]] is with me and [[UJ]] is at home making spaghetti for halloween youth group
4 HR AGO
My kitchen will look like a murder scene
4 HR AGO
rofl
4 HR AGO
Halloween Murder Spaghetti
4 HR AGO
Thought for the night... The apprehension and paranoia of people we know to be different and love because of things said by others has to stop. I apologize for falling for it and allowing it to happen. Please forgive me. Thank you for working with me to rebuild :slightly_smiling_face: Love you
1 HR AGO
I love you too!
1 HR AGO
Oh and Halloween murder spaghetti is actually pretty tasty
1 HR AGO
I almost made some tonight. It sounds good.
1 HR AGO
Its the new halloween holiday meal!
