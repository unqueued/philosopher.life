It goes. Grinding away in the wiki.

School's been fine. Reflecting on the week with the family.

Worked hard on my cover letter to the EFF

Parts of it are finalized, but I realized that I'm going to need to be even more explicit about who I am with them.

I'm rickrolling them twice in the letter. It's balls-out.

How's Adam doing?

That was like reading a good book. I cant think of another feeling to compare it too. I got to the end and felt like, "ah, the universe of that topic was explained to me concisely but to the full extent."

I also appreciate that when I click on the footnotes, the text pops up right there. I'm so used to having to flip to an appendix in a physical book or, with an ebook, having to navigate back and forth with a clumsy table of contents or just clicking back and forth through pages. The formatting of your wiki is so damn good.<<ref "2020.02.12-2">>

Wow! Thank you. That is insanely high praise. I am doing my best!

Aye. " I'll just bite the bullet and drop the pretense of formality here." and footnote "But wait, there's more! You can plainly see I also appreciate the value of calculated humor in the workplace."

I'm glad you like the formatting! The wiki is functionally an awesome tool for forming things.<<ref "2020.02.12-3">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.12-3" "Nope. Not really interested. Okay. The gap between how she speaks on the phone and messaging is huge. I know how much she writes (obsessively for most of her life), so I'm still surprised by it. Aside: my thinking is that people are quick to blame social media, but won't recognize that it can be done correctly, and further, that they aren't likely to pay the price themselves.">>
