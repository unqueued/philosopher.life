How's your week going?
FRI 9:45 PM
Good —Jer finally got an admin job
FRI 9:47 PM
He is the asst Principal at his school
FRI 9:47 PM
How are you and the raccoons?
FRI 9:47 PM
That is awesome!
FRI 9:48 PM
Yes!
FRI 9:48 PM
He needs a paddle.
FRI 9:49 PM
Yes!
FRI 9:49 PM
How are you?
FRI 9:49 PM
I'm doing well enough. Grinding along. Reading+Writing. Working on monster-16.
FRI 9:50 PM
It is a slow transition, but I want to do it right.
FRI 9:51 PM
My raccoons are doing well. [[1uxb0x]] is installing Arch Linux from scratch on his laptop with me. [[j3d1h]] is grinding along. There's a tool called Ratox I'm asking her to explore for me (it sends messages without needing a server in a way that meant to be programmatically used).
FRI 9:51 PM
That’s pretty cool
FRI 9:51 PM
I like that his admin job is at his school. I assume it will make for an easy transition for him.
FRI 9:52 PM
And, now that his foot is in the door, he can eventually go wherever he wants.
FRI 9:52 PM
Probably not a lot of admins fighting for music in schools. Good to have him there.
FRI 9:52 PM
Yes He is so excited —he came home after his first day today saying that it is gonna be a great year
FRI 10:03 PM
Some of the people at the district office sent him welcome to the district calls and emails —-he’s been at that school 18 yrs hehe
FRI 10:04 PM
Good gracious. 18 years. Time is flying.
FRI 10:05 PM
Yep definitely
FRI 10:05 PM
I'm sure it must be an odd feeling to be welcomed like that.
FRI 10:06 PM
It was —he met one lady that he has met many times and she asked where he came from....he was like um here...
FRI 10:07 PM
Ugh. =(
FRI 10:07 PM
Its ok —he knows the kids and the parents and the teachers and what needs done
FRI 10:08 PM
I mean, I can't remember names to save my life. But, multiple times is harsh.
FRI 10:08 PM
Makes me feel happy and less like a jaded cynical husk to know he's doing the job.
FRI 10:09 PM
(which doesn't matter, but still...I'm super happy he's got the job)
FRI 10:09 PM
He'll be kicking butt.
FRI 10:09 PM
I am glad that he got the job there —I hope it is the bestest year for him
FRI 10:10 PM
Preach.
FRI 10:10 PM
Looking forward to the after Christmas thingy too
FRI 10:10 PM
:blush:
FRI 10:10 PM
I have 6 classes this year (more pay no planning) I waste my planning anyway
FRI 10:11 PM
Mostly math and one Bible
FRI 10:11 PM
Sounds like a solid mix. Will keep you super busy. Moar coke.
FRI 10:12 PM
Yes yes
FRI 10:12 PM
It’s [[AG]]’s class that I have for Bible
FRI 10:12 PM
Noice. What is the concept of the class?
FRI 10:13 PM
Then two geometry, two alg 2 and one alg 1
FRI 10:13 PM
What material will you be using?
FRI 10:13 PM
I am not sure yet ...hopefully find out Monday
FRI 10:13 PM
Teaching your own children The Bible is a special task.
FRI 10:13 PM
In the past they have used a curriculum that is based off of Pilgrims Progress for the 10 th grade
FRI 10:14 PM
Yeah I am excited :blush:
FRI 10:14 PM
Some of her classmates asked me if I could do their Bible class this year so that’s good too
FRI 10:17 PM
Noice. That is nice to have students who actively want to learn from you.
FRI 10:18 PM
Yes! I have them for math too —most are great kids and even the stinkers are too bad
FRI 10:19 PM
How was the weekend? Tomorrow's the start of the whirlwind, aye?
SUN 9:38 PM
Yes and I go to the dr too —they found “unusual cells” and he is going to recheck
SUN 9:54 PM
Ah. Alright. That is not a pleasant feeling. Hopefully, it is nothing. They are fairly cautious about that sort of thing. My wife had to that, and a friend of mine recently.
SUN 10:06 PM
Yeah I am trying not to worry until tomorrow
SUN 10:08 PM
