I am continually amazed by the fucktards who don't value privacy - https://spideroak.com/articles/facebook-shadow-profiles-a-profile-of-you-that-you-never-created

* OP has a much better grasp of employment problems than the vast majority of people I've seen (/u/SaikenWorkSafe's comments are cringe-worthy in their ignorance of the nature of the good and the complexity of measuring it) - https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/6ba13l/the_screwed_job_market_why_are_good_percentage_of/
