To Whom It May Concern:

I know [[Why You Might Hate Me]]. I'm here to learn you how it's done, son. I will turn you Straussian yet, my Padawan. Channeling Elijah: watch me strut, taunt, 360-no-scope, style, serve it, teabag, and drop-the-mic on you. Yes, like any Hobbesian realpolitik-rhetoric writer, I am going to arrogantly virtue signal to you so hard it will make your head spin. 

`Do I have your attention?`

My disdain for you knows no bounds, psychopath. I have empathized with you enough to realize I must blot you out. Call me a racist and a culturalist: I hope Humanity cleanses itself of you. I wish to collectively engage in eugenics and eumemics of your neurotribe and corresponding metanarratives. I'm calling for the complete genocide of your hard-coding found in our bodies and the memeplexicide of your psychopathic algorithms from the network of our computational minds. 

You really are the evil part of our nature, and we cannot allow ourselves to become unified into the all-hating machine because it's wrong in theory and pragmatically imprudent in practice: a house divided will not stand. Your evil entropy erodes our unity. Applying the principle, since we are divided against you in this world, we're coming to wipe you out on this holy-crusade-jihad to unify the world of Humanity into a collection of good persons.

You need to hear what I'm saying, even if only because you initially want to make fun of it in our dialectic. Go ahead and paranoically hate me as much as you can; you're gonna need it to ~~show~~ rationalize it to yourself that I'm wrong: yeah, that's how fucking //right// I am. At least one of us is delusional, and I think it just might be you, punk. Mmmmhmmm. I'm feeling lucky: I think I know the objective truth better than you. Young schola', I'm a better wrestler than you in this Arena of Reason. This crazy lion is accepting all challengers. 

I am your justified memetic poison. I aim to inject myself into, subvert, and sublate you in our dialectic like a righteous version of Agent Smith. The ancient Greeks paid handjobs for their wisdom; I'm going to invert your paradigmatic existence in payment for mine. The righteous light will end you or die trying. 

Come and get it, bitch.
