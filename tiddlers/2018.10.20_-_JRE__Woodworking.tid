title: 2018.10.20 - JRE: Woodworking

Raylan is gone until tomorrow. My brother is capitalizing on this emotional energy to engage in woodworking. He's prototyping on inexpensive wood to make cutting boards before using the expensive stuff. He doesn't like his tools, which need to be damn precise. It sounds like this a $10,000 hobby to have what he wants. I think his life is in a lot of flux. Hopefully, he will make a sick shop! I'm surprised he doesn't dream and plan about how to bootstrap into the shop he'll use for the rest of his life.

My brother is experimenting with propane and epoxy. I'm very excited to see. This is at the cross of woodworking and...something else? I don't know what to call this art besides: sculpting (High/Fine Art). What kind of woodworker does he want to be? Actually, I wonder what he dreams of making?

You know, I have always wanted to make a hand-carved canoe. If he ever gets a big log, I could help him. I know I'm not as skilled as he is, but I do think I have a talent for carving. That's probably not real woodworking though.

What does he want to make? Why? There are so many possibilities. 

Of course, the wiki-apostle in me is screaming out, even when I'm not saying it out loud. We talked about what I'm doing in my wiki. He dutifully listened.

We talked about my stress rash, and he has a fungal problem on his ankles too. Mine is fungal too! 

We talked music with the family for a bit. My brother thinks the drums available to him make him feel less of himself, so he doesn't play them. He wants the electronic variety to play along with music. I'm contradictory here myself because I don't value my own music that much, but I'm playing it. Admittedly, I love the permanency of the woodworking and the wiki more than making rivalrously consumable, fleeting objects which vanish. 

I like that my brother is making things which matter to him. That's a good sign. I hope he finds purpose in it. 

He wanted to get back to it, so the called ended.
