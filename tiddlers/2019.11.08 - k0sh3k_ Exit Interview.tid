title: 2019.11.08 - k0sh3k: Exit Interview

//Tell the truth. It costs you something you can afford to pay, and they need to hear it point-blank. Kindness is often a [[SO]]ed niceness into [[infinigress]] toward [[The Other]]. Let us hope they are Okay rather than OK Boomers, and barring that, at least give those who haven't unjustifiably crystallized a chance. Your colleagues deserve a letter and blueprints upon which to reflect.//

* They don't hear you in meetings nearly well enough.
** As the person who does the most work, you should have the strongest voice.
** They laugh you out of the room on some obvious things.
*** Hopefully, they won't be laughing as you leave not just the room, but the building, institution, and community.
** Don't speak to management beyond [[Gary]]. They are not on your side, and you are just unnecessarily handing them ammo and a pulse for counterattacks.

* They have had you do 2-3 librarians' jobs (even when you say "no"), and that's despite the fact that you have far more obligations outside of work than anyone else there beside BJ (and his job is thankfully part-time, set in stone, even if his position is also in danger). 
** You have to handle social media, 20+ students in management, and ILL every day in addition to at least 80% of the department's side projects. It's absurd, especially when you pile on all the other events. 
** They are going to have a very hard time replacing you, and that should be recognized as part of the problem of how they used and worked with you laterally and up the food chain.
*** There's a reason there is high turnover.
** Piling the job requirements even higher is already missing the point.
*** They are obviously tempted to exploit young singles, DINKS, idealists, the desperate, and those who can afford and wish to do it simply for the status. Who else is going to do that much work for that kind of artificially suppressed wage?
** On-call 24/7 is ridiculous. It's raw exploitation.
*** You are getting communications at midnight and 6am.
*** You are the person responsible for running the library ~16 hours a day (~7 days a week) where you are required to fill in all gaps on a department squeezed for everything, and you get paid for 8 hours at 5 a week (well, closer to 5.5 at 5, and that's still wildly accepting market value as fairness).
** The job has been bad for your health (which is not sacrosanct, but something to be balanced in vocation, of course).
*** Depression and anxiety is something you've always had, but I think it's often justified. 
*** You are afraid to sleep without your phone next to you. Literally, afraid.
*** You feel unable to stand up for your workers' rights, you are too worried about taking time off (so much pressure from those around you on it too), and you won't fairly reclaim overtime. Others seem to have far more flexibility, far less work, and more ability to takes breaks than you have.
*** Not having help during summers made them hell on your mind and body.
*** There's a reason they don't want to touch your work with a 10-foot pole: it's too much.

* At a macro-level, a significant percentage of post-secondary institutions are exploding out of existence. There's strong reason to believe this is a sinking ship within a bubble that is bursting. 
** Hell, even look at the other schools in this tradition: its network is dying. 
** The contradiction is coming for it in the material dialectic. While it may survive, the price it will pay to Capitalist Pharoah has and will be its soul. 
*** Fascism is on the rise (which is conceptually distinct from the Rule of Law, anarchists). It's right there on campus and its edges too.
** The faculty are publicly memeing hard during the meetings. Basic justice is being thrown out the window, and the humanities are dying like flies.
** It's a professional diploma mill masquerading as a prestigious Christian liberal arts school which rides upon the appearance of being a faithful community, sportsball, and the value of its alumni networks for money and influence. 
*** This is an entrenched guild capitalizing on its population, not an institution aiming to serve others.
** The department doesn't tell a meaningful enough and honest story with itself and the other individual and emergent agents in the game. 
*** You can't morally be a passive, centrist, pluralist, Daoist refusing to commit to dialectics. Skin-in-the-game, don't go down without a fight. The group isn't being critical enough in its reasoning about normativity in general (despite being librarians!).
** The only reason you aren't completely on the chopping block as a department is because of how credentialing currently operates in the US; that may give way some day.
*** Losses in professional development, how your workers are treated by the school at large, how administration ignores you, how your resources are cut at every turn, for examples, are only warning shots across the bow.
*** This only gets uglier the broader we look at education infrastructures. Yale's libraries are under fire too.
** Libraries are dying except insofar as they serve as commons and community centers more generally.
*** You can accept this, for example in terms of the Gamerishgate debacle, but you must fight for autonomy and funding toward fair access and usage for all library users. 
**** If you don't shape how it evolves, you are just being dialectically hollowed out.
**** e.g. You can agree that gaming machines need to be in the library (they do!), but they should be for everyone. The same for infrastructure improvements they've made. You (and the public) have rotting potatoes compared to their caviar.
*** The digital illiteracy rates among your librarians is too high. You all need more I-school in ya.
*** FOSS or perish.

* Positional Suggestions (snipped if speaking to more audiences)
** Katie's job exists to please one wealthy donor. Fine. Render unto Caesar, and then get your real work done. 
*** She's obviously going to need to become the in-house tech person. Make the archive position dovetail with an open infrastructure for the library.
**** She has several years of schooling ahead of her. What [[j3d1h]] did for her was child's play compared to the work she needs to do.
*** She doesn't seem devoted to her own vocation at all, so her long-term position is also in question (which is fine, but honesty would be valuable here).
** In too many cases, [[Gary]] isn't fighting for the library correctly. He's a passive conduit just making The Way for administration to destroy the library one inch or mile at a time. He has to wake up and fight much harder.
*** At best, he's simply gullible in these false compromises. 
**** I'm going to give him a lot of room as an autist, but I know he can see where I'm pointing too often (and we barely talk!).
*** Gary must be in charge of student workers. He isn't going to feel the pressure to do the right and fair thing with people's schedules unless he is personally going to pay the price.
*** It feels like Gary is just trying to do as little as he possibly can before he retires. I have no problem with him leaving, but how he chooses to do so matters (the same for us).
** Mary is the liaison to the incestuous Good Ol' Boys club, and she can afford to make sacrifices. It is not obvious that she is alarmed enough in how she speaks on behalf of the library. Ideologically, she's still centrist. 
** David requires cross-training. He seems to lack an understanding of how the library functions more generally (though few seem to). 
*** It's not just the MLIS he needs as an assistant director: he needs broad-spectrum experience. 
*** He's likely your cavalry, backdoor artist, levy, and he has a voice they are going to trust in some respects.
