Sarah Buss: Autonomous Action: Self-Determination in the Passive Mode


How does autonomous agency differ from mere agency? When I act, what must I contribute to that act for it to be my own?


The Big Picture


We’ve seen a number of answers to the above question: a second-order volition (Frankurt), an endorsement/identification (Dworkin), approval of the formation process (Christman), endorsement via one’s true self (Ekstrom).


Buss’s answer is that you needn’t contribute anything. An act of yours is autonomous, she thinks, and hence your own, and hence one for which you’re accountable, if it springs from motivations that support at least a minimal level of human flourishing.


Buss wholeheartedly embraces agent passivity. Others seem to think that agents must do something to make their desires autonomous – they must evaluative them, identify with them, endorse them, or at least deliberate about them. Not so, thinks Buss.


Buss’s view is also unique in that it defines the self in terms of a species-specific account of proper functioning. To be autonomous, think many, is to be ruled by the particular person that you are (i.e. by your character or true self). But on Buss’s view, to be autonomous is to be ruled by who you are qua member of a species and not by the particular person that you are.


Problems with the Standard “Super-Agent” Model (SM)


Buss: SM holds that agents are autonomous insofar as they exercise their agency in a special way, either by deliberating about their desires and actions or about forming attitudes about them.


On the deliberation model, autonomy is the product of reflection and evaluation. But:


    Agents can be accountable for their habitual, spontaneous, and careless actions. They are accountable for behaviors that aren’t, or wouldn’t have been, the product of deliberation.

    Agents can be unaccountable for their deliberative reactions because of various autonomy-undermining influences on their character.


On the evaluation model, autonomy is to be found in our attitudes and judgments about our desires or actions. Autonomy, on this view, is a matter of endorsing ones desires. It’s a matter of having your actions reflect the attitudes that constitute your “point of view”.


But autonomous action, Buss argues, needn’t be endorsed action. Ambivalence, frustration, and disappointment needn’t be accountability defeaters. And while actions that express your point of view might be authentic, you could nonetheless fail to be accountable for them.


Buss offers a second argument against the evaluative model on 654.


She also notes that any “super-agent” model will face a regress. If agents need to do something to make their desires autonomous – if they need to express their agency more fully - we’ll have to inquire into the autonomy of the requisite “doings” or “expressions”, which will require postulating additional doings or expressions, seemingly ad infinitum.


Buss’s alternative model


Buss: at the heart of agency is passivity. An agent’s commitments are the effects of dispositions in relation to which she is passive. What we see as a reason, and how much weight we give it, is a matter of passively responding to dispositions within us. Whether someone acts autonomously, she thinks, depends on whether she can be identified with these passive influences – with the direct, purely causal, nonrational influences on the formation her intentions.


Buss resists the view that whether you can be identified with these influences depends on whether they are part of your character or core self. You can be accountable, she thinks, for behavior that’s out of character, and the fact that some behavior is in character is not sufficient for accountability.


Instead of appealing to character or to a core self, Buss suggests that you fail to act autonomously when you form your intentions under the decisive nonrational influence of conditions that are elements or symptoms of human malfunctioning.


This account, she argues, is supported by an asymmetry in our judgments of accountability. We tend to excuse people when they act from depression, anger, or fear – especially when they’re overcome by these emotions – but not when they’re overcome, say, by joy. Unlike the negative emotions, the positive emotions, she argues, don’t undermine autonomy unless they metamorphose into something different in kind (e.g. joy into mania).


Buss: the debilitating negative conditions undermine autonomy because there is an important respect in which they are external to who we are. The key to autonomous action is the deep connection between who we truly are and who we are when we’re not sick or in pain or the victim of some other pathology or disability. Sickness is a kind of hostile takeover.


A caveat: for a sickness to be autonomy-undermining it can’t just affect one’s choices. It has to alter the background conditions that determine what one takes as a reason and how much weight one gives to it.


Buss: we can’t give a precise account of what minimal human flourishing involves. Still, to understand autonomous agency, we must think hard about what distinguishes eccentricities and deformities of character from mental illness and disability. A trait, roughly, is disabling if, when it’s a stable disposition, it typically prevents the members of the agent’s species from satisfying one or more of their basic needs without exceptional effort.


Manipulation


What should we say about brainwashing cases?


Buss: if a mad scientist blocks one’s constitutive psychological dispositions from playing a behavioral role, then he prevents the human flourishing condition from being satisfied. This is the equivalent of not having any such dispositions, and that is a form of malfunction (see 687).


Over time, though, she thinks that a brainwashed person can come to be autonomous. What matters is whether the indoctrination leaves him in a condition in which he can’t function minimally well as a human.



Problems and Questions


A. Just like Aristotelian conceptions of happiness seem to show that even plants can be happy, Buss’s account seems to imply that animals can be autonomous. Any creature capable of intentional action, it seems, will be autonomous (and thus accountable for his actions) provided that she is functioning in a species-typical way. That seems rather bizarre.


B. Why should your identity be cashed out in a species-specific way? Doesn’t Buss’s account imply that if you were the only member of your species, you couldn’t be accountable for your actions?


C. Can’t we appeal to a non-Aristotelian notion of human flourishing? Why not say that there are dispositions that make one’s life go well and dispositions that make it go badly, and that one is accountable and autonomous when one is governed by the former and not the latter?


In making this move we embrace a version of the rationalistic model of autonomy, which Buss rejects for the standard reason that it doesn’t seem like a model of self-government. But I wonder if her view is susceptible to the same objection.


D. It’s not clear why functioning in a non-species-typical way should be seen as an autonomy-defeater. After all, we can imagine a person who gets “sick,” but in a way that greatly enhances his abilities in a non species-typical way. Such a person, though, wouldn’t lose his autonomy or his accountability (presumably). That suggests that what’s doing the work for Buss is not the loss of biological humanity but rather its bad effects. But then why aren’t bad effects alone enough to undermine accountability?
