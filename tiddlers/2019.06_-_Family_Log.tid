!! Audit:

* I love seeing my offspring write this one for us. It's a joy to see their [[Moth Languages]] too. Humorous [[title.Title]]s are a tiny game.
* I'm grateful that we get to be silly with each other.
* This log may never have been the bulk of family time, it's still a non-trivial barometer. 
** As their wikis tell the story far better than I ever could, this is just a [[SO]] kind of meta tool and perhaps even just a tradition I respect because I don't understand its limits well enough.
* My offspring are getting happier and more productive. We aren't even close to where I want us to be, but we are making huge strides.
** I am concerned they will not be able to jump back into work correctly after a 2-week break. Let us hope I am wrong. History has demonstrated my worst fears. We must learn how to break that cycle too though.
* My son has been obsessed with video games, but he hasn't really played a ton of them. I am glad he earns his playtime though. I'm lucky to see him bouncing up and down as he gets into his games, loses himself in the worlds, and so on.
* Frisbees have been kicking complete ass. 
** It's great for the whole family, but it is much better 1-on-1. There is a dialectal kind of trust in the to and fro which I adore.
* I think our "happened last week" section is ridiculously weak sometimes. Meh. It's okay. 
* My offspring have been more concerned about their schoolwork, quite clearly. I am grateful. I hope we get into the groove where it's only a celebration.
