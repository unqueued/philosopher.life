!! Audit:

* My Realpolitik section has continued to focus more and more upon the intersection of technology and politics. 
* I've also been posting less. 
* Like the rest of the American people, I'm starting to become desensitized to the insanity of Trump's presidency bit by bit. It's disheartening, but also "yup, that guys an idiot, what else is new?" This is likely the wrong outlook.
