title: 2018.05.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Copy Cat

!! What does "copy cat,? mean to you?

As my exploiter, MWF, would phrase it: "stick a quarter in me." I'm radically opposed to intellectual property and any unjustified pursuits of Hegelian+causal immortality through art creation (except insofar as you literally generate AI's from it...but that is a different move to me). I think you are all insane on this topic. Who gives a shit about getting credit? You think it's cheating, stealing, piracy, etc. KYS, Samwise.
