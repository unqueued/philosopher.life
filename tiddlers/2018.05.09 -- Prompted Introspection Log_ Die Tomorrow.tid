title: 2018.05.09 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Die Tomorrow

//I knew this question felt extremely familiar. ROFL. Welp, that's okay.//

!! If you died tomorrow, what would you most be remembered for?

By whom? I'm that unbearable, awkward, autistic freak to most people, and perhaps everyone. I think my family members would have fond memories of me to some extent. I think this wiki is something to remember me by.

I'm not entirely sure what it means to remember. Memory is not a simple issue. How cognizant must one be of what is remembered? There are ways in which I've caused an imprint in the world that will not be consciously recognized, and in that causal sense, I leave my memory in the world around me (up to a lightcone of my age). But, that isn't what we usually mean at all. 

I consider the pursuit of remembrance a pursuit of immortality and power.
