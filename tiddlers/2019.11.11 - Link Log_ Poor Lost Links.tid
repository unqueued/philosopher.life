* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21490714
*** Excellent discussion (even the mistakes aren't boring). I am shocked by some of the quality of the comments. No functioning theory from any of them, but good pointing.

* Think About It
** https://fair.org/home/is-ok-boomer-the-new-n-word-or-are-millennials-still-destroying-everything/
*** I get it. Some percentage of younger adults are quite wealthy and powerful, and not all boomers are even close to the median for their age group. Further, not all boomers are responsible (I grant the 3%!). Responsibility comes in [[dok]], however, and if you continue to look at the demographics, boomers tend to be reactionary. In the dialectic, I have two enemies as one.

** https://thecorrespondent.com/100/the-new-dot-com-bubble-is-here-its-called-online-advertising/13238920200-5fcd64b8
*** Maybe you need to broaden your concept of marketing beyond a very specific kind of online advertising. I'll agree plenty of data which is collected is useless. I agree to radical ineffectiveness all over the place. I'm willing to call it a bubble too, but after it pops, what is the real material with economic value left? It's still centralized, privatized surveillance.
** https://letter.wiki/
*** Pretty darn close. Unfortunately, still doesn't have the features I require.
** https://spectator.us/trump-re-elected-left-liberal-stupidity/
*** A fine argument. We aren't close enough for me to make a prediction yet.

* Interesting
** https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068
*** Good times for some lines of meritocratic argumentation.
