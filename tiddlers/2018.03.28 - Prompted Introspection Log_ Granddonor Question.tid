title: 2018.03.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Granddonor Question

!! What is one unanswered question you would like to ask your grandparents? Why?

Asking effective questions can be really difficult. Don't you think so Lady Melisandre? Good questions and answers illuminate the theories of minds of the asker and answerer for each other. It's about sharing contexts, reference, and empathically bridging with each other our distinctive perceptions of ourselves and the world. It's about connecting the stories we tell ourselves with the stories others tell themselves, in a way, telling our stories together in some cogent way. Some gaps are nigh unbridgeable, unfortunately. I often find I'm not able to really connect with others because the empathy dynamic is so asymmetrical. This is why I talk to myself more than anyone else.

The kind of question I'd want to ask would be so systematic and embedded with normative and perceptual content that my granddonors would be drowning. They'd literally need to be able to see the world as I would in order to be able to attempt to answer the question. They aren't capable of bridging the gap, and even if I could put it into words for them (perhaps this wiki does that), they certainly wouldn't take the time to get to know me well enough to answer my question.

I would want them to defend their identities, choices, and lives. //Why did and do you deserve to live as you did and do?// Justify yourself! Of course, they will not be able to do this effectively for a number of reasons. Obviously, I really want an ideally-ideal epistemic agent, like none of us, to answer my questions.

I'm too polite (even though my contempt bleeds out of me), so I'd probably ask about our ancestry to have more information to help my children.
