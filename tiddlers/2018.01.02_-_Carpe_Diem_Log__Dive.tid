* Woke at 8:30
* Woke chilluns
* Dove into the day
* Redid the room
* Worked on [[Invisign]] with daughter
* Cannabliss
* Talked with JRE.
** We had some interesting conversations about our visit, another visit he had (which we used an analogy), and other things. I must think more about what he said. I wonder if he was trying to tell me something and I misunderstood (which it is so easy for me to do).
* Talked with wife for a while. 
** She made more sense after she told me she was PMSing. I didn't understand the context until them. I used to be better at guessing this. Why did I lose it?
