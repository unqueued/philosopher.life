Excessive reliance on algorithms not only masks the persistence of bias, but also threatens to make human experience itself appear totally random.

Wikis remind me of self-contained intranets because they are collections of content Byzantinianly stitched together with internal hyperlinks. Oversimplified, the web is a wiki of wikis, etc. I care about hyperlinks because they are portals to relevance and relationships. They are geometric sequences of concepts, tools, and interactions from which beautiful worlds, unique reality maps, diamonds, and redpills emerge. The web is our machine-assisted (or controlled) collective consciousness.<<ref "1">> I'm going to ride this rollercoaster, the wild-west, until I can't any longer.

Here you find a record of my browsing habits, projects, and the digital tendrils I use to crawl and interpret myself, the web, and the world around me.

!! Principles:

* Categorize, catalog, organize, and annotate as best you can.
* Collect tools, silos, sources, communities, and rabbitholes.
* Do not fear imperfection; it is better to put it somewhere rather than nowhere.
* Linkrot is always a problem. See Google's cache and https://www.archive.org/.
