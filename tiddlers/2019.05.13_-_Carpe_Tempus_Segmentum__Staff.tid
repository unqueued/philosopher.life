title: 2019.05.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Staff

* I was woken a dozen times through the night for vitals, pissing, and IVs. 
* This sheeple woke up at 8
* Breakfast, piss, IV
* New doc saw me, and he definitely saw me as just another number. Cool, cool. He initially suggested I stay another day, but he was open to me leaving today. He requires another round of IVs, but we don't know how long that will take.
** He took my word for it that it was better. I'm actually surprised the hospital doesn't just take pictures or video. I guess some people think the fewer the records the better (and understandably). This seems like it would obviously have helped the doctor rather than rely upon my word. I feel like watching BSG and talking about airgaps. It doesn't matter who I am to some people; it only matters how I appear to them in a price-efficient signal.
* The Janitor here, a woman of retirement age, spoke at length with me. They restructured the hospital (something something TPS reports), and she is contracted now. She held her tongue despite my laying every thread. I got "the nod." She works here because she says she doesn't want to sit at home, and she wants to be useful. 25 years of nobility in that woman, and I told her that too. She says she couldn't be a business woman. No doubt. 
** The nurses have to put on a different authoritative face at times with me, but they are also fairly down to earth (especially the assistants). Those working the admin and the doctors I've seen come in a range. 
** The woman who served me food put the fucking hospitality in hospital. The lowest on the ladder are drowning, and they heap hot coals on my head with a smile. 
** I had an extremely methodical nurse. He daisy chained and setup the machine to stop coughing up annoyances, and he held down the fort solo all night. He's from a big city and was clinical (yet personable) in his interrogations, explanations, and assessments.
*** I met 2 instructors too. They were not surprised I was a teacher, and they told me what they understood about what they were doing.
** The nurse from last night in SCU2 said I must be a terrible teacher (she's right) because I don't know the name of my family's doctor or the address of our pharmacy. It's true, I can't remember that stuff. I can drive us there, I can look it up too, but my wife balances the practical for us.
*** She came in during [[Family Time]] with my wife and daughter discussing modernism and us reading our wikis together. She talked about her grandchildren with me then.
