title: Still Needs A Naming, Stil

//Writing systematic philosophy is hard; I have to build my own language. Setting aside most of [[The Foundation]] problematics of meaning for a moment, words like [[phenomenology]], [[hope]], and [[love]] often require precise names and definitions in order for us to have the concision necessary to write in higher abstractions with lower friction. Here I lazily collect some {[[dream]]} words defines.//
