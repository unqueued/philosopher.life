*** Head back to the humanities. The elite have no use for the humanities beyond attempts to justify exploitation and the banal pursuit of the aesthetic isolated from [[The Right]].

*** Yup. I'm pseudo-Hegelian. I need metaphysics and metaethics, and Marx can never provide it. I need theory and practice. I assume the top-down a priori, and I see us [[fff]]ingly working toward it. Marx lacks prescriptive telos. Kant is his savior even if he denies it. The author points to it in several ways, thankfully.
*** Politics is clearly an external corrective in some cases, especially insofar as it corrects balances of power necessary for enabling others more fairly (in line with early Rawls, imho). I think the author has missed the boat here.
*** Any discussion of the natural is going to need to be an evolutionary account which rides on game theory, imho. That's not where he wants to go, and I'm not in love with the misuse of the word natural to slip content into arguments.
*** I think Marx would still adore my pragmatization of [[TOP]], in fact, it looks more Marxist than Hegelian (but, there is the special sauce ;P...I've never met another Kantian that can give this account, though I've seen attempts to idealize the bottom-up process). I adore that Marxism is really about decentralization of power, votes of how we live our lives together. I cannot deny it. I'm the insane man who thinks he's always right, but even I must push for extremophilic and resilient democracy (knowing full well how much I despise the masses while paradoxically treasuring them).

* Think About It
** https://theoutline.com/post/7142/be-yourself-is-terrible-advice
*** Identity validity is a hard problem: it's what it means to be ethical. I'm fine with the advice when it is justified. Unfortunately, even the journey to becoming more virtuous has paths which are more virtuous than others.

*** See, my bed is made: [[Aispondence]]. I'm building Noah's fucking Ark here. 
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds
*** Well, that certainly didn't change my mind.
*** Ineffectiveness and inefficiency don't mean we ought not. Yes, we know rhetoric is better. Not listening to your cognition is a choice to some non-trivial [[dok]].
** https://boingboing.net/2019/03/13/principal-agent-problems.html
*** Auditability and formal verification are crucial starting places. The privatization of this problem is insane though. Still, this is not an argument against e-voting in general.

*** And, yet, I still see a decline in piracy.
** https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/exiting-vampire-castle/
*** I appreciate the desire. Utopia aint gonna build itself, and we are required to punish. There's no escaping it.
** https://archive.fo/prSOO
*** But, I think enlightened self-interest is not what matters (at least as that is usually understood). I'm slow to blame the Left for failing to coalesce all the way down here, and I'm opposed to what I find to be rhetoric. I'm interested in acting from duty, and that is seen as an archaic perspective by most people, not just Leftists.
** https://thelibertarianideal.wordpress.com/2018/12/24/networked-tribalism/
*** So much excellent work here, but decrying tribalism is tribalist. It reeks of pomo and the denial of objective truth. We have different notions of [[The End]]. Solving the Principle-Agent problem aint easy though.  
** https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00095/full
*** The core cannot be fleshed out in context without already making commitments to justification, identity validity, and what it really means to empathize with those who lack empathy. It appears empathy comes in orders, and empathy as a whole and in the ultimate analysis requires us to turn it off with some folks in some contexts. Moral psych though is rarely their skill; they think they can do this valuelessly like so many other scientists.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/opinion/data-privacy.html
*** Once you reveal information to someone, you are trusting them to only reveal it in contexts you deem acceptable (in many cases, none). I'm not convinced we have a blank-check privacy right (as much as I would like to). I think we have privacy rights against centralized power in many cases though, and that has some profoundly hard to solve problems (or unsolvable). The some but not all of obscurity can only be solved when we can define what counts as justified deception (even through omission), and it gets ugly when it sits in conflict with free speech.
*** We don't have a prima facie right to not be judged. Some people do deserve that protection though! I think the more powerful you are, the less you deserve privacy. I also think you owe it to your peers to be open; practical accountability is something we are theoretically required to have.
*** I'm not convinced privacy is wielded to construct meaningful relationships, but I agree it allows people shape and fit themselves into the social structures around them. Many of the privacy problems I see are really other kinds of problems we've decided to let individuals attempt to solve through privacy management because we aren't interested in solving the root cause.
*** In practice, the pursuit of privacy itself is chillingly oppressive in many respects especially because so few give enough of a shit to use tools which enable it.
*** I'm convinced political animals are morally obligated to deprivatize themselves in profound respects. I'm not pomo, radically pluralist, anti-perfectionist, or deluded into being a member of tribes who claim they have no tribes. Putting our identities on the line is uncomfortable up to being obscenely vulnerable, but quite necessary. 
*** Interesting to me, I think there are parts of my identity which are quite obscure compared to the average. Googling my offline identity will net you very little; my job search has forced me to part with my preferences here against the powerful.  
*** As usual, little or no distinction between moral and political here, but this is not a technical piece. 
** https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712249664/the-end-of-empathy
*** I can see the onus is on me here. I can't leave it to psychology to define empathy; they are shit in conceptual analysis. I also think the crisis of capitalism is going to have profound dialectical impact on the extent to which people experience empathy.

** https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/04/instant-loading-amp-pages-from-your-own.html
*** Don't need AMP to do this. I already have a broken version of this on my wiki. Still have a root trust problem. Fascinating to see this is the claimed solution to a privacy problem when I think it simply centralizes that sensitive information even further.
