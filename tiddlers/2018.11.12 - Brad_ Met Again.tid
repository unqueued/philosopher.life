title: 2018.11.12 - Brad: Met Again

I went to Brad's today. We talked about our pasts. He's actually been a private and public prison guard as well. He showed me the scars of getting shot (he also once shot himself literally in the foot). He got his throat cut in prison during a riot because they weren't being fed enough. He thinks very poorly of both inmates and guards. 

It turns out he had ransomware from something he pirated. He wouldn't setup port forwarding (or allow me to), and he wouldn't install virtual machine. I setup Signal for him though, so that's good.

He considering selling me his primary machine instead. I would very much like that. We benchmarked the machines; 150 Gflops from 6 cores (12 threads) is nothing to sneeze at. The secondary machine sucked, well below what I expected.

He likes to soup things up, including his vehicle. I think he has nothing to do with his time. He sells computers for money on the side at another shop.
