title: 2013.11.07 - Philosophy of Law: The Concept of Right

Right/Duty come in pairs.

A genuine legal right is enforceable (by some entity, not necessarily the claim-holder). Unlike morality, where enforceability has nothing to do with having a moral right. Genuine vs. Nominal normative force (genuine entitlements vs. nominal entitlements).

How enforceable? Is it that someone merely attempts to enforce, or does there need to be a certain success rate/threshold?

If a law generates a right, but it isn’t enforceable, is that law still valid?

Liberty/No-Right (somehow not duty of non-interference) pair – Permissible??

Right entails someone’s duty to do or not to do something, always.

Power/Liability Pair

Immunity/Disability Pair







Legal ought, warrant, should, or normativity is nominal. Who cares? Why should I follow them?

The study of law is parallel to the study of etiquette and polite manners, the study mechanics and rules in games, etc. Yes, the concept of law is distinct, but why is it important?

At best, they only have hypothetical imperative qualities: If you want to be polite, then you ought to follow the rules of etiquette; If you want to play a game of chess, then you ought to follow these rules; If you want to do what is legal, then you ought to follow laws. Why we should be polite, or play chess, or do what is legal is not established by their respective rules. These arbitrary rules are not genuine, standalone reasons for acting in a certain way.

So, why is law important? If we take up the legal positivist position, we don’t have the obvious underpinning that natural law theory has. It becomes quite unclear why law is really important, except as some arbitrary instrument to fulfilling moral requirements. Show me why the law isn’t some “pretend” normative structure that doesn’t spiral.
