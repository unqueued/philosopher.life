Well met, nomad! I'm glad you've taken me up on my offer out here in the desert.

Before I continue, I ask you take a close look at {[[Contact]]}. These are some important rules I play by. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I will do my best to explain myself to you. You may also find {[[Help]]} to be a useful introduction to this wiki. You might also be wondering about my motivations for reaching out to folks on [[/r/misanthropy|2018.09.28 - FTO: /r/misanthropy]]; this is an application of [[Find The Others]], one of my {[[Principles]]}. I encourage you to explore this wiki, since it may give you perspective on who I am and what I'm doing here.

Alright, I have a bunch of questions to start us off:

* What has drawn you to writing open letters with me?
* What kind of relationship do you want to have?
* [[Your name|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Ericson_(disambiguation)]] is famous! Why do choose this name for yourself? 
* Why do you consider yourself a misanthrope and/or why were you browsing https://reddit.com/r/misanthropy?

I [[hope]] to get to know you. I'm not sure what you wish to tell me about yourself. I feel compelled to ask you more, so I'll pull out one of my goodie bags, [[Getting to Know Someone in X Questions]]:

{{Getting to Know Someone in X Questions}}

This seems like a manageable introduction. I'm happy to pass messages however you prefer. If you are interested in using your own wiki to do this, you might check out http://tiddlyspot.com/ (there are many different excellent hosting methods). Feel free to take as long as you'd like to respond. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
