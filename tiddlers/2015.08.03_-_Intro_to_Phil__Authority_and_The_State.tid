title: 2015.08.03 - Intro to Phil: Authority and The State

Authority and the State

    What’s a genuine government?

    What’s a genuine law?

    What is the relationship moral obligations and laws?

    We’re only touching the surface of these problems.





Our Obligation to Respect the Laws of the State: Plato, Crito

    City-States

        Our governmental geographical borders and politics are larger and more complex.

        Radical democracy

            Although, you still had to be a land-owning, adult, male, with a certain background.

            We live in a democratic republic, which is supposed to have similar democratic views underlying it.

                We don’t really though. Recent study of the laws passed show that it doesn’t matter what normal people want, it’s only what extremely wealthy people want that dictates what the law will be.

    The point of the state is to benefit the people. If it isn’t doing that, then it’s not a useful or good government.

        Socrates doesn’t care about religious nationalism, etc.

        On his view, it doesn’t have some supernatural moral status that some nationalist’s apply to it.

        We obey and conform to laws because, ultimately, it’s best to live in a society which conforms to laws (assuming those are the right kinds of laws, etc.).

    Anyone may leave at any time, with their property.

        That’s definitely not the kind of state we live in, or most any of the countries around the world for that matter.

        You need permission to leave, you need permission to enter.

        This text shows a different world view. A world without the same sorts of boundaries. Where there were still resources and lands undiscovered, untapped, and open.

    Socrates chooses not to escape from prison.

        He obeys the law. Even though he disagrees with it, and even though he will pay dearly for it (they’ll force him to kill himself).







Sovereignty and Security: Hobbes, Leviathan

    Divine Command theory (Aquinas)

        Probably failures

        Note that there is a difference between the claim that God has a providential hand in selecting the leaders of governments and the claims that Kings made that they were in fact the people selected by God to be kings.

    The purpose of government is to avoid wars.

    State of Nature

        A description of humans before there were governments.

            Natural condition of homo sapiens

                That said, there are arguably social rules and governments even among the more intelligent apes. We probably evolved with a strong social view embedded in us and around us.

        Possibly a hypothetical circumstance

            You might just try and imagine what it is like. Even if it never existed. It’s a thought experiment.

            It’s also perhaps a kind of social contract we’ve implicitly made when we agree to have a government and be governed.

        Competition for Resources is the catalyst for violence

        Brutish and short lives of people in the State of Nature.

            Life sucks without a government.

            Might makes right.

                Solely survival of the fittest in competition with the weaklings.

        Arguably, this state of nature claim isn’t just about governments, but perhaps about morality as well.

            For example, I know many atheists who are glad that divine command theory came about, since they’d argue it is at least better than the state of nature, and that the development of morality and government through religion has, at least until recently, been an overall good thing in history.

    The Social Contract

        A hypothetical contract.

            We don’t actually sit down and write it out or agree to it.

            What kind of contract is that?

        A voluntary choice to give up our natural freedoms in exchange for security.

        We have traded our absolute freedom for the safety provided by a government which rules over us, enforces laws, keeps the peace inside the state, and prevents foreign invasion.

    The limits of the Leviathan (the authority)

        Leviathan doesn’t have a right to unlimited power.

        Leviathan only has the right to the amount of power necessary to provide the security sought after in the social contract.







Consent and Political Obligation: Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government

    Lockean State of Nature

        Governed by natural (defined as divinely ordained), morality, based on rational self-interest.

        Law of Nature

            We are equal, independent, and we are morally obligated not to hurt other people (life, liberty, property, pursuit of happiness, etc. – all that constitutional stuff).

    Self-Ownership as Natural Law

        Right to their bodies

        Right to their labor

        Right to the fruits of their labor

    Social Contract

        Locke agrees to a social contract which justifies a government which protects our self-ownership.

        Voluntary Act

            We have to consent.

            Do we literally consent?

                Did we ever really find ourselves in a state of nature, consent to a contract?

                    No.

                    We were born into this.

        Tacit Consent – Original Compact

            By having lived within the state, we tacitly consent.

                What if you didn’t have a choice though?

            Using the highway, we consent.

                What if this was the only way to leave the state so you didn’t consent?

                What if there were not states to go to?

                    That is, you don’t consent to any of them, but you can’t live anywhere.

            This Original Compact furnishes us with moral obligations to obey the state.

                What about when those moral obligations conflict with other moral obligations?

                    Nazism?

                    What if the state isn’t protecting self-ownership? Is it a government at all?







Society and the Individual: Rousseau, The Social Contract

    Social Contract

        “each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will”

        General Will

            Public person formed by the union of all other persons

            Abstract embodiment of the sovereign power of the state

        Giving up the power to your person to some degree, but gain the power to others?

            Nothing is lost?

                Not obviously true.

    General Good vs. Individual Good

        Morally, we are not allowed to enjoy the benefits of a government without making the due sacrifices required by obeying the government.

            Taxation without representation flipped.

                No representation without taxation.

        Anyone who doesn’t follow the general will can be justifiably compelled (coerced) to do so.

    Infallibility of the General will

        Wtf?

        Completely lacks adequate protection from abuse

    Unanimity is required for the social contract

        But, who will do that?







Property, Labour and Alienation: Marx and Engels, The German Ideology

    Americans have been conditioned to be allergic to Marxist concepts.

        Failures of communist states do not show that socialist views are entirely incorrect or wildly misguided.

        Marxism is sometimes viewed, by its opponents, as a kind of conspiracy theory.

        There are many variations of this point of view, just as there are many variations of Libertarianism we find in Locke and Nozick.

        It’s time to be charitable. You may find you actually agree with a lot of what someone says, and you just didn’t realize it at the time.

    Theory of economics, history, human nature, and the relationship between morality and law.

        History consists of conflict between various classes

            Generally, the wealthy aristocracy and the poor.

        At all times, societies are divided up between people who own the "means of production" and those who do not.

            The means of production are the things needed to make products.

                E.g. factories and machines and things like that.

            The people who do not own the means of production will always struggle against the people who do own them.

        Eventually, Marxism argues, the workers (proletariats) will win the class struggle permanently.

        Marxism argues that capitalism is a bad system because the workers produce all the value of goods through their labor while the owners get most of the money.

            Interestingly, a Lockean with a strong proviso interpretation might even see how this is true.

                Own our labor, the fruits of our labor, etc. But, that doesn’t seem to play out in capitalist societies in force.

    Dominant classes create the dominant ideology

        The purpose of this ideology is to help the dominant class to maintain power and unfair economic systems which help the elite.

        7 corporations owning all the major media outlets is a sign of this.

        Lower, non-dominant classes accept the dominant ideology as natural

            They lack exposure to the possibility that the ideology is wrong

            They aren’t educated enough to see they are manipulated

        Working classes not only lack the knowledge to have the will to oppose this enslavement, but they also lack the economic and militaristic means to oppose it as individuals.

            Only a unified revolution can stop it.

            It requires working classes become conscious of it, and then to act in their self-interest.

    Criticism

        What do you mean no property?

            How does the world work?

        Some inequality and some kind of market (doesn’t need to be unrestrictedly free) may actually have the best consequences in the end.

            You might maximize the minimum this way.

        Libertarianism, Self-Ownership

            Most of us just have bad luck

        Why should we think Revolution is naturally going to happen?

            There may come a time when revolution just isn’t possible.

        Many socialists consider this Marxist view to be extreme. Marx may be on the right track, and he’s nailed some core notions and practices down, but maybe his solution isn’t the best one.







The Minimal State: Nozick, Anarchy, State and Utopia

    Should there be a government at all?

        Yes, a minimalist state.

            Only as large of a state as required to protect personal property rights.

        His basic foundation is the “inviolability of other persons” and a libertarian view that “there is no justified sacrifice of some of us for others.”

    Foundation for an Entitlement Theory

        What are persons?

            “Sentient and self-conscious; rational (capable of using abstract concepts, not tied to responses to immediate stimuli); possessing free will; being a moral agent capable of guiding its behavior by moral principles and capable of engaging in mutual limitation of conduct; having a soul.”

            This isn’t sufficient though. It’s missing something, on Nozick’s view.

            In Nozick’s eyes, a person must be able to formulate a “life-plan”

                A person must have “the ability to regulate and guide its life in accordance with some overall conception it chooses to accept.”

        Nozick’s argument then joins together the capacity to form life-plans with having a meaningful life, a life of moral worth and value, and an identity which merits special treatment.

            Nozick concludes that persons have certain rights which others have a duty to respect and to refrain from violating.

        Personhood is about possessing the right to make choices about property with regards to one's life-planning; justice is concerned with the protection of that right.

        It is here that Nozick provides a lens of property rights to examine justice.

            In the Nozickian world, property is the medium by which persons can create and execute life-plans.

            The use and ownership of property enables persons to pursue the sorts of things which make them persons.

        Nozick believes only persons can own property.

            Only an agent capable of having rights would be capable of having a ‘right to property’ or entitlement to a holding.

        Self-Ownership (Locke)

            These are moral rights.

            On this view, over-taxation is a form of slavery which unjustly steals a person’s ownership of themselves

        Self-interested persons will seek to protect those rights (and themselves) and enforce the duties of others.

            Through society’s invisible hand, a natural set of “mutual protective associations” will arise from social contracts and market forces which would eventually give rise to the minimal state.

        Justice, in Nozick’s view, is about preserving and protecting legitimate entitlement to property.

            By protecting property rights, the medium by which persons can execute life-plans is protected, and the special nature of personhood is actively guarded and cultivated.

        The minimal state exists to make sure persons’ rights to themselves and their properties are not violated and that others follow through on their duty to not violate others’ property rights.

    Entitlement Theory

        Nozick maintains that a person may come to own property through one of two processes:

            legitimate acquisition (principle of justice in acquisition)

            legitimate transfer of property (principle of justice in transfer)

            There are no exceptions (except the principle of rectification)

        Principle of justice in transfer

            This principle is concerned with maintaining fair and valid social contracts as the sole means for persons to choose how to distribute goods among themselves.

            This secures trading and gift giving, while also preventing fraud, theft, and any sort of activity which violates a person’s current entitlement to a holding.

            The ability of the owner to transfer a holding is true of all holdings.

                All property is transferable.

                Any property which for any reason could not be transferred is not ownable.

            Lastly, legitimate transference is justice-preserving and historical.

                Entitlement to a holding which has been passed from person to person relies upon the repeated application of the principle of justice in transfer throughout the history of a holding, continuing all the way to the point of that property’s legitimate acquisition.

        Principle of Justice in Rectification

            The historical aspect of the principle of justice in transfer becomes complicated by the fact that the current world is thought to be unjust, and that current holdings have not been generated in accordance with the above framework

                To apply the entitlement theory in an unjust world, past injustices must be rectified.

                    For example, if you are given stolen goods, would you have a legitimate right to those goods?

                        No. The rightful owner is the victim from whom the goods were stolen.

                    One-time exception to how property is owned here.

                    Nozick has a principle of rectification which corrects historical injustices, recreating a justice-preserving chain of legitimate acquisition and valid subsequent transfers.

        Principle of Justice in Acquisition

            Lockean concept of Mixing labor

                A person legitimately acquires a currently unowned thing (the world is assumed to be initially unowned) by mixing their labor with it

                Nozick might go so far as to say that persons are mixing a part of themselves into objects which they will acquire

                Generally, it is the mixing of labor which results in an increase in the value of an object that appears to be the engine of this principle of acquisition.

                Nozick explores the difficulties in the mechanics of legitimate acquisition, the exact details regarding the meaning of mixing one’s labor are never fully explained

                    Dumping a can of tomato juice in the ocean doesn’t make it your ocean

                    Chopping down an unowned tree to make a chair, now that’s your chair.

            Weakened Lockean Proviso

                In Nozick’s view, the principle of acquisition must take into account the effects of acquiring a property upon the rest of the persons of the world.

                Nozick concedes that property rights have limits, and appropriation will need to take into account, to a very minimal extent, some of the life-planning necessities of other persons.

                    In order to judge what objects can be acquired and transferred (owned), Nozick wants to provide another principle which helps to regulate the principle of acquisition.

                Can you own all the water sources in an area?

                    Water is necessary for all life planning

                    Nestle wants to privatize water ownership.

                How should we draw these lines?

        Ultimately, Nozick believes a free-market driven minimalist government will naturally arise from the sum choices of individuals seeking to protect their ability to effectively plan and conduct their lives.

            Not much justification is given for it.

    Criticism of Patterned-Justice Theories and End-State theories

        Ideal distributions of wealth have a pattern, on these theories (see Rawls)

            E.g. merit, or need, etc.

        Gifted basketball player example

            You’d have to continually re-distribute

                So?

        Justice is about being blind to the results (end-states), and instead only about applying the correct principles (consequences be damned; this is a deontic theory).

            This is direct conflict with Rawls, who obviously cares about having the right basic structures and distributions.

                (Also a deontic theory though, interestingly)

                    Consequentialism, to some extent, is embedded in all moral theories.

    Critiques of Nozick’s view

        Nozick himself renounces the work.

        Conflict with other moral theories

            Self-Ownership is exceeding strong on this view.

            Note, you don’t have to help the drowning little girl in the pool 10 feet away from you. After all, you own yourself.

                You don’t have the right to hold a person’s head under the water, since they won themselves, and with respect to that action, you don’t own yourself.

                Property rights are self-ownership based.

                The only exception are the moral rights/duties which emerge from the moral minimal state.

                    You do have to pay taxes. That isn’t true enslavement though.

                You still don’t have to help the drowning girl though.

                    The moment you start adding those requirements, you will find huge cracks in this theory which isn’t supposed to be, by definition and on principle, concerned with the welfare outcomes of others (excluding the proviso for acquisition).

        Do we really get a small state out of Nozick’s principles? Maybe the minimal state is still very large when we think about it.

            No welfare, it seems.

                Although, what if welfare were the only way to protect the assets of the wealthy?

                    Just enough welfare to prevent a Marxist revolution.

        The Proviso maybe should be incredibly strong

            Nozick may have been wrong about it.

            He doesn’t give enough evidence to show why his very weak proviso is correct.

        Marxist Critique

        Rawls’ Critique

        Impractical, Devolves into an Aristocracy that won’t uphold this justice

            One of the first things an observer might notice is that the Nozickian world certainly brings greater benefits to the most talented and resourceful persons. Nozick might say that they deserve those benefits (regardless of whether those traits are innate, conditioned, or based on choice), not as a result of end-state patterned principles, but simply as a product of the natural selection of the free market and the likelihood that such agents would plan their lives in certain ways by virtue of their gifts and talents.

            In a hypothetical implementation of his entitlement theory, it is not difficult to imagine the population's minority (being ultra-gifted, talented, and highly skilled persons) as coming to own an overwhelming majority of property to the detriment of everyone else (but not so much as to trigger the very low baseline of the proviso).

                Even if critics could agree to have an elite class arise, what would make us think the elite class would continue to uphold justice?

                What would prevent the elite from having undue influence on the implementation of the entitlement theory or the free market?

            Wouldn’t the elite class, which holds the lion’s share of market influence, strategize and act to maximize their benefits by warping the previously free market to their advantage?

                The elite could artificially raise prices, collude, and execute anti-market practices to boost their profits.

                These things, done carefully, are certainly possible even within the strictest applications of Nozick’s justice system.

                For necessary goods and services, artificial increases in prices can be considered a type of tax in the free market (benefactors and payers of the tax may vary).

                The elite’s influence on the market might be so profound so as to “tax” the less well off for necessary goods without violating the proviso.

                    Nozick is against undue taxation. But, his theory seems incapable of handling the problem of this taxation.

        Slavery

            Non-Persons are screwed

                In Nozick's system, beings who are not mentally capable of planning and executing life-plans are no different than the rocks, trees, land and other disposable objects in the universe.

                Personhood testing would need to be constant.

                    How would you even know who counts as a person?

                    This metric is vital to defining the population of actual persons. It would be easy to imagine a “life or death” testing of all beings. Testing would likely have to happen constantly to make sure “so-called-persons” continually matched the criteria.

            Nozick’s entitlement theory must allow for slavery (the complete ownership of another human or agent).

                Property is property; and even persons (who own themselves as a legitimate holding) can be owned.

                Persons can legitimately transfer self-ownership to another.

            Fully embracing Nozick’s entitlement theory would very likely lead to the enslavement of humans and agents that do not fully qualify for the status of personhood.

                Imagine that you found an unowned mentally deficient human on the side of the road (who didn’t qualify for personhood/self-ownership). You could put a leash on that human (thereby mixing in your labor with it) and legitimately acquire entitlement to that human.

            Personhood problems again:

                Should the extent of inviolability, personhood status, and merit scale with measure of life-planning capacity of an agent?

                    Perhaps the possibility of life-planning more effectively than others will make one agent more valuable than another.

                    After all, if life-planning is really the essential ingredient to personhood, and the capacity to life-plan varies a great deal amongst agents (and merit is acknowledged by the quantity of said aptitude), then a personhood bell-curve could be generated, scaling reward to aptitude.

                    Or is the line of personhood entirely binary and modular - you either have it or you don’t?

            It isn’t just mentally deficient adults who are marginalized, or senile elderly humans, but even children in the Nozickian world.

                Strictly following his person-making requirements, we would surely have to admit that young children aren’t persons; they are simply incapable of the sort of life-planning which Nozick expects of persons.

                Nozick is aware of this problem, but does not really give an explanation for how children aren’t slaves.

        Parental ownership of Offspring

            The problems of child slavery run deeper because the possibility of ownership of children isn’t simply based upon their lack of the ability to form life-plans, but also because they are a product of labor which grants legitimate acquisition rights to the mixers of labor.

                Since persons have a right to the products of their labor, it would follow that parents have the right to the products of their sexual, incubational, and post-birth cultivational labor. The human reproductive cycle appears to be a valid means to appropriation of newly created humans within the entitlement theory.

                In Nozick’s world, parents are fully entitled to their children, in the same way a person can be entitled to the growth of their fingernails or an autumn harvest of crops.

            On this theory, don’t parents own their children forever (unless ownership is otherwise legitimately transferred)?

                It would be an illegitimate transfer for parents to lose any degree of ownership in offspring without a social contract; parents could refuse to give up entitlement to their offspring.

            Nozick needs to stop this. I have many questions:

                When do children come to own themselves?

                Do parents own their children until they have developed into comprehensive life-planning moral agents and so on?

                What would prevent parents' altering their children's mental status or capacity in order to prevent loss of property?

                Even if a child might eventually develop person-making characteristics, should we not view those as the fruits of parental labor over time?

                    Human development is really a complicated mixture of labors of a village of agents. Perhaps communities own, in some part, their members.

                Why can’t producing children just be a more fun process than producing a robot child, but where you own both?

        Problem of Self-Acquisition/Transfer

            How do people come to own themselves?

                Nozick provides almost no formal account of this issue - which is unfortunate because it is fundamental to the foundation of his entire entitlement theory.

            Persons, by definition, own themselves.

                You aren’t a person if you don’t own yourself.

            Only a person can own property.

                Self-Ownership means you are an object of property that you own.

            In transfers, one person transfers a property to another person.

                Maybe my parents owned me to begin with. Unfortunately, they can’t transfer ownership to me, since I’m not a person.

            In acquisitions, only a person can acquire property.

                I can only own a car because I am a person.

                I can only be a person if I own myself

                How can I acquire ownership of myself if I don’t already own myself?
