I have a new idea. Somewhat technically challenging but not as much

Super insightful breakdown of the nature of fascism
Nov 16, 2019 5:07pm
Thank you! 
Nov 16, 2019 6:16pm
I'm grateful that you pick out what is salient for me (and us) out of ChapoTrapHouse, btw.

One of my problems with subbing to it is that it overtakes the rest of my subscriptions, and I prefer not to multireddit too hard.
Nov 16, 2019 6:17pm
It's an excellent sub in some respects, but the signal-to-noise ratio isn't always as high as I'd like (especially since I don't tend to follow that particular subculture closely enough). 
Nov 16, 2019 6:17pm
I also aim to to spend more time reading my enemies. 
Nov 16, 2019 6:18pm
Haha have you ever listened to the podcast? There are elements of the sub I don't like and the podcast hosts have been known to criticize it (rightfully on most points, imo)
Nov 16, 2019 6:55pm
Aye, I've read a little right accelerationist and "dark enlightenment" (lol) literature
Nov 16, 2019 6:56pm
Nick Land is a real thinker (if wrong), but these other clowns like Mencius Moldbug are fucking jokes
Nov 16, 2019 7:02pm
And they're basically just trumped up STEMlords
Nov 16, 2019 7:02pm
Aye, lol.
Nov 16, 2019 7:03pm
The Rationalist^^tm^^ crowd are a set of cultic reactionaries I also watch and think about it.
Nov 16, 2019 7:11pm
I find the whole expansive phenomenon so pathetic
Nov 16, 2019 9:28pm
They're so bad at reasoning and so arrogantly oblivious to it lol
Nov 16, 2019 9:29pm
It's tricky. I can point to several geniuses in the crowd. Some of the things they say are correct, but they are not nearly as skilled in philosophy as some other disciplines. I feel they do a good job in their rhetoric (and I'd argue manipulation) of making it difficult to provide counterarguments to their audience (who don't really want to hear a profoundly opposing point of view).
Nov 16, 2019 9:31pm
My favorite thing to do to a LoGiC reactionary is to trap them into calling, e.g. a character attack an ad hominem. I then get to run laps around them explaining in detail why not just any attack on someone's character is a fallacy. Or similar with appeals to authority
Nov 16, 2019 9:32pm
Fuck yeah, lol. That is one of my gotos! Lol
Nov 16, 2019 9:32pm
Right. It goes back to Plato. Sophistry is always easier than philosophy because as he says in the seventh letter, truth is not something attainable by a straightforward application of a "method" or argumentation. It's cultivated by "long engagement in dialectic"
Nov 16, 2019 9:33pm
Not that they actually give a shit about virtue theory. 
Nov 16, 2019 9:33pm
Reactionary sophistry will always be more easily accessible than leftist thought because the latter is by definition grounded in deep dialectical engagement
Nov 16, 2019 9:34pm
Of course not. You're absolutely right. That's their metasophistry. The appearance of caring about virtue
Nov 16, 2019 9:34pm
I am convinced one can build reactionary memetic dialectical structures just as complex. That doesn't make them honest though.
Nov 16, 2019 9:34pm
Virtue of the practice of being a reactionary sophist runs deep.
Nov 16, 2019 9:35pm
Hmm i6ll have to think about that. I guess my initial reaction to that is that dialectic by it's very nature weeds out sophistry (eventually)
Nov 16, 2019 9:36pm
Its. I can't type
Nov 16, 2019 9:36pm
You have more faith in humanity than I do.
Nov 16, 2019 9:36pm
Oh no no
Nov 16, 2019 9:36pm
You mean logical dialectic? That I will agree to.
Nov 16, 2019 9:36pm
I'm like Heraclitus. I have tremendous faith in the Logos and polemos' role in its unfolding. But little in humanity's willingness
Nov 16, 2019 9:37pm
I think they have the capacity, not the will
Nov 16, 2019 9:37pm
I agree to that!
Nov 16, 2019 9:37pm
My idea is this. I'm going to train a neutral network to do solid deepfakes. I'm going to deep fake 1 or 2 images and make a fake tinder account. Issues with the deep fake can hopefully be resolved with training the neural network well, using faceapp and photoshop for minor changes, and filters if need be
Nov 17, 2019 10:19pm
Neural network*
Nov 17, 2019 10:19pm
Once I make the account I just sit and wait. I don't force it to be uncovered
Nov 17, 2019 10:20pm
The attack may work without deepfakes. 
Nov 17, 2019 10:23pm
Technically, yes. And the profile will include [[REDACTED]] I have access to. But given that I have access to them via a public Facebook profile, it's not a leap to reasonably suspect that they were just pulled from there. Whereas if I can make convincing deep fakes...
