Hi h0p3,

I've really enjoyed seeing your letter to me dated 06.25 develop. However long it takes until you consider it 'done', I appreciate you taking your (and my) words seriously. I also appreciate the constructive condescension you've shown me as my superior in this art. I'll refrain from returning the flavour until the meat browns.

<<<
Wow. That's awful. You've suffered more than I could imagine. You've been on a rollercoaster these past couple years. I'm glad to see you still standing. Some of the most empathic people I have met are those who survived trauma, suffered, and grieved enormously. You pass through fire with grace.
<<<

Rollercoaster, yes, but don't get the wrong impression. I am blessed in many ways, and my difficulties never lay outside the bounds of what the average person in our condition could expect to experience.

<<<
What made you ready this time? (Re: Dating Selah)
<<<

Unsatisfying answer: Who says I was ready this time?
I'm tempted to say something more like, well, if previous attempts resulted in confusion, but this try resulted in an engagement, doesn't that justify a post hoc assertion of readiness? But that's fuzzy even for me... I don't know man, sometimes I just do stuff.

This recently came up with my brother (we are both fun at parties): there is something called "Death Thought Accessibility." Your name and emphasis are important to me. I often do not understand what people are saying to me. I'd like to know what you think about the idea.
<<<

Interesting.

“What is necessary, after all, is only this: solitude, vast inner solitude. To walk inside yourself and meet no one for hours—" (Rilke).

Experiences I share with you will likely be misunderstood or transformed in the transmission. Not because you are autistic, or a Deist rather than a Theist, but because information loss is the tax we pay on communicating while remaining distinct. But you mitigate a ton of this by asking clarifying questions, and by obviously adopting the mindset of a serious listener. Likewise, a lot of what you've written (not to me directly), I find difficult to grasp, but I am making efforts to think about you and understand you. Despite our vast differences, I don't feel especially far from you.

I sometimes wonder if alienation is a communication-level phenomenon. Like, if we all just understood each other, meaningfully, maybe that would be enough. But the voice cries out in the desert (not you, the other one): Repent! Is that it then? If so, then understanding is only a prerequisite to change, which is the necessary act. The extent to which you and I will diminish our mutual estrangement will be the extent to which we've changed meaningfully to more resemble one another. I don't feel far from you, but we are estranged insofar as our goals and actions don't cohere (which is arguable).

"Then all things will be put under Him, that God may be all in all." We shouldn't merely understand each other, but act to transform each other to be better workers of Righteousness (neither of us are walking this path perfectly, though I think we're both trying - the goal of all meaningful communication is to orient one another towards that path , thus we get greater coherence (again why I appreciate the way you're writing 06.25, the points you contradict, you don't merely refute, but you're trying to get me to understand!)).

So Death-Thought Association: I've heard social priming studies are on the rocks recently, but assuming there's something to this research...they suggest that threatening one's worldview will increase DTA. Have my death-cognitions increased since we started communicating? You've been very gracious, but you are challenging me.

How about you since becoming a public mind? Has your wiki made you feel less alienated? More?

I know you would never treat prayer like you are just using some cosmic vending machine. It's serious. That practice has helped me habituate myself to talk about what matters most when I'm all alone or with others.
<<<

Let me share with you a cosmic vending machine story.

A few years ago, journée Saint Jean-Baptiste (public holiday), some friends from church wanted to have a picnic in the park. No one brought a frisbee (lame), so I left to go find one. A few blocks later on the main street I realized that most stores were closed; public holiday (doh!)...ALSO turns out that I'd left my wallet back at the park and had no way of buying one even if there were an open shop that was selling (double doh!).

So I zigzag my way back, hoping to find one in a dumpster or something. All the way, I'm praying to God for a frisbee. I don't normally pray frivolously, but at that time, I felt that praying for this frisbee was the right thing to do (and given what happened, I feel (post hoc) vindicated).

Now I give up checking out the alleys, and just walk straight back to the park, a heart full o' faith, and then, right in front of me, this lady walks out of her house with one of those large circle plastic sleds for children. It's the middle of summer, and she decides now to throw out a perfectly good saucer sled! I ask her if I could have it and she says yes. I walk back to the park a hero, we toss it around, and it flies like a comedically oversized dream. Bonus: It rained later that afternoon, and the 'frisbee' did double duty as an umbrella.

I'm not sharing this just to be contrary. I live in the conviction of the seriousness of prayer, and the immense abomination of plying Divinity for earthly gain. But I do want to broaden how you interpret my thoughts when I talk about God in relational terms. In a vacuum, an anecdote like that would be trite, or blasphemous, but in the context of a submitted life, it's wine from a water barrel.

<<<
While not realtime, you are the first person I've prayed with in many years. I aim to honor the practice as best I can. I agree one can say true things in a prayer, and seeking or coming to terms with the truth during such moments is something I hold in high regard. Thank you for praying with me.
<<<

Thank you for honouring what I hold sacred. I've re-read this letter a few times, but in addressing this paragraph, at this very moment, my heart and throat swell.

<<<
What were you eating?
When did you know you wanted to marry her?
<<<

Shish Taouk.
Not right away! I've been in delirious, jackhammer to the chest-love before, and this...wasn't immediately like that. Instead, everything feels just so right when I'm with her; when we're doing stuff together, or not doing stuff. Pictures in my head of Selah stooping, swinging her arms, tilting her head, pointing with her nose, my chest warms, she looks at me, and I wake up. But on our very first date, I remember thinking "She doesn't know what a podcast is? This can't go very far!" I don't know at what point I knew that I trusted her with the future; that I love her; (I feel my anemia) but I do, and she is happy to be with me, somehow, and I can only hang my head and be loved.

You may or may not like me, understandably (I appreciate your patience), but I like you DEATH.ofrobinhood. I'm going to offer my silence to you again. If you think you should say it differently to me, and if my argumentation and disposition are getting in the way, then please present it as you prefer and ask me to quietly listen.
<<<

I find you an interesting and provocative person. Maybe 'like' isn't the right word? Though I have high moral expectations of others in general, I have difficulty not empathizing with the person before me, regardless of how far off the map I think they are. I may not be oriented alongside a person, but I actively dislike very few, even people I recognize as evil. SO, I like you, but my liking is not worth very much.

I admire you, which is rarer with me. I think I really started thinking positively of you a week or two after I started casually reading your wiki, I found a letter you'd written (to your sister? sister-in-law?) pleading with her to leave her job at a vampiric (redundant?) life insurance agency. I love that.

There are a handful of people in my life who are very strange, or intense, or violent, or whatever, who I absolutely make time for. I feel like I would upend my plans to spend time with you regularly. You sweat salience.

That said, forgive me if I'm hurtful here, I'm also half-expecting a reversal of affection at some point in our exchanges. Your letters have thus far been very complimentary of my character, but there are many things about me that are unlikeable. I have not yet resisted unto blood.

<<<
What was bleak, absurd, godless, or tragic about his life?
<<<

In the sense that the guy couldn't catch a break. I'd rather not list a man's misfortunes to defend a careless statement, but enough to say I didn't mean his life was all those things in sum. From the outside, it just looked like a series of bad things happening to a person, with no justification or resolution. Here lies the evil of searching for narrative significance in another person's life. I'll stop myself here from advancing farther in judging things I know nothing about.

My neighbour has become more erratic, and even creepy. Sometimes she will harass Selah and I with nonsense accusations "you're stealing my identity." "you're profiting off me." "you're a vampire." "you're a demon.", other times she'll just wordlessly follow me around. I'm probably not as worried for my safety as I should be (Selah visits frequently, but doesn't live with me), but we've recorded an encounter, which might be useful. The landlord wants to kick her out, but that would likely mean homelessness for her at this point, so I'm trying not to involve him too much before we can find a way to get her help.

Btw, I find j3d1h's art really smile-inducing (not just because I find Undertale a lot of fun). I especially like her tribal wolf and vaporwave designs! Has she ever done longer form comics?

In service of T42T, here's some ancient animation work of mine:

I...would appreciate you not adding the link to my Wiki entry ;)

Peace,
