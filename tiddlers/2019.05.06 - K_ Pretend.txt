Seems like a cool dude. 

Have a great day!

Aye. He seems to be a man of honor.
MAY 6 8:58 AM
Poor freelance animators have it rough these days.
MAY 6 8:58 AM
Aye. Most freelancers in general. The army of reserve labor turned contractor so that we can outsource liabilities and foist logistical costs onto the workers.
MAY 6 8:59 AM
And, you have a great day too! Lol.
MAY 6 9:00 AM
What you up to?
MAY 6 9:00 AM
Work. I’m taking a hiatus from my horror novel and giving Fantasy a fair shot to see if the writing feels more natural.
MAY 6 9:06 AM
Sounds fitting with your DnD work too.
MAY 6 9:07 AM
Any particular books or authors stand out to you in fantasy?
MAY 6 9:07 AM
Also, how's work going?
MAY 6 9:07 AM
Well the world I’ve been pouring into is secretly part of an already established world so it would be done purely to accommodate the two years of work I’ve already been doing. Hahaha
MAY 6 9:17 AM
Nope. I’m eager to start reading some Brandon Sanderson because I’ve heard good things.
MAY 6 9:17 AM
Work is fine. I don’t have a lot to do this summer so I have to pretend I’m busy. :(
MAY 6 9:18 AM
Not fun pretending, but I hope it will still be productive time for you there.
MAY 6 9:43 AM
It's cool that you get to re-use your work.
MAY 6 9:44 AM
Makes good sense to me.
MAY 6 9:44 AM
It's going okay so far. I still wanna finish my horror novel, but I'm not sure I've got the chops to write something truly scary yet
MAY 6 9:45 AM
Yeah it's frustrating, but money is money.
