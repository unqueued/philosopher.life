title: 2018.03.28 - Deep Reading Log: Underground Railroad

I don't know what to say about the physical "railroad," but I'm not disappointed by it.

The book seems to be a laundry list of horrifyingly racist activites, attitudes, structures, etc. which the author has woven. It's like we flit from racist scene to racist scene getting a taste of the systematicity of the problem.

The unethical medical tests are disgusting. The book does a damned good job of explaining the nature of an underclass systematically generated through a sole category: being black.

It's very interesting to see how those in power who falsely take themselves to be attempting to free black people seek to do so only on the grounds of maintaining their own happiness/safety. I assume I'd be accused of brosocialism, but I see all class disputes on the grounds.

The cadavre body-trade problem is really odd.

I'm actually lost about what the train really is doing. It's doing a lot of work, and I'm too slow to understand it.

I'm sorry, but I'm actually fascinated by racist language. I like new words, even when they are evil.
