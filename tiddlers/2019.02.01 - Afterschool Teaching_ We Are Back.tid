title: 2019.02.01 - Afterschool Teaching: We Are Back

Asked Dorsey about lab and TW. He grunted on both. I'm 90% sure he thinks I've overstepped my bounds in his body language (as well as my gauging of the reactions of his friend). Tough titties. As long as Delp and Mitchell have my back, I have all the capital I need to push for what I believe my children deserve (at the very least) in this case.

Friday is always the easiest day. There are fewer students, and it is a free day (though, I am receiving conflicting instructions and opinions on the matter). Delp has recommended we read to them. Hm. I have offered. Is he being pressured from his bosses? They just had the director's meeting, I believe.

I get the feeling they have assumed that my background would make it so that I would radically transform everything they are doing. If they helped me control the students, we could. If I'm spending my time managing behavior, I won't be able to teach. Motivation is never my strong suit. If the kids aren't interested in learning, I'm not going to make them. I can't. The stuff I would be teaching requires willing students who are going to struggle. As much as I can be disappointed by my own actual children failing to try on their own, when it comes to the dialectic, they pay attention. I can't get the same of public schoolers (which isn't to say that is even mostly their fault).

For comparison, my kids and I went through the first chapter of my dissertation today, and they got it. They saw several steps ahead, asked good questions, wrestled back with their own opinions and biases, and questioned the rhetorical structures. They took some notes, and they participated in the dialectic like adults. I can be this useful to the students in the afterschool program, but they have to actually want it. The fact is that most of the adults have never even heard of what I want to teach the kids, and they adults themselves lack the integrity and willingness to learn. I can't fix that kind of moral stupidity in everyone at once.

I'm pretty sure I'm forced to just work on an individual basis. I'm going to question them like Socrates, interrogate, interject, offer opposing points of view, and force them to question themselves. They are going to have to want to listen and think with me. I don't see the signals, and I don't have the support of the rest of the staff. There are limits to what I can be responsible for accomplishing in a given time frame.

I help with their schoolwork, and I look for teaching opportunities. I'm not here to coerce. I'm not here to censor. I'm not here to say no to technology use. I'm not here to instill nationalism, mindless rule-following, respect for authority, traditionalism, conservative-oriented outgrouping, Christianity, or merely convenient behaviors.

I'm not convinced that what admin values is correct at all. This is nothing like what I would give my own children in these circumstances. I cannot dictate it all.

Whitney was fine. At this point, I'm calling more of the shots while still deferring as much as I can. I assume Matt will primarily do the paperwork and glad-handing (that he did). 

I had the kids do more cleanup.

I complimented 5NP on his improved behavior. He's getting better with me. I am not sure why.

7Sf is sick today. She's gotten worse quickly (I have seen 3 sick students today), and I had her call her dad. She started crying and it lept out of her into me. Delp saw, and he tried to give me paperwork mid phone call to take my mind off it. I've tried to build space for her to rest, and I keep checking in. 

Whitney is talking with the high schooler a few years her junior. Yeah, there is sexual tension there. She's straight up flirting, lol; if I can see it, it must be ridiculously loud and clear (mind you, I'm beyond awful at picking it out [which, perhaps, is reason to doubt this case]).

Oh, wait, the crew came up to preach. The mother could not be more proud. It was fascinating to see. If you could inject Christian memeplexes harder into D.A.R.E., this is what you'd get. I do appreciate some of the [[redpill]]ed aspects. They are teaching some bits of critical reasoning, and that can be applauded.

I shit you not: the preaching kid said Reagan is his favorite president with a spiel. I could spend my social capital to correct him up front, but I think it would be better for me to offer a followup discussion instead. 

The preacher talks about the evils of media, but he clearly hasn't experienced almost any of the media these kids are listing. I grew up with this bullshit. The propaganda has been well-designed by the mother.

They started spouting terrible science about substance use, blatantly false legal "facts," etc. I did speak up then. I will take them to task for direct, provable (less value oriented) lies in front of my children. The mother stepped in to misdirect eventually. She is teaching her boys to be rhetoricians.

Delp asked me how I was liking it at the end of the day. I said I thought the work I was doing was valuable.

I'm so grateful to have the janitor there. He's my only actual friend in the entire facility (though I could be wrong about him). I aim to show him profound respect all the way down; it disgusts me the way he feels it necessary to play a social cowtowing game among his "betters." I ain't playing that game. Fuck that shit. I'm hyperpersonal, there with him as myself, and I only expect P2P interactions. He needs to know I give a shit about him even if no one else does. He might never understand who I am (I won't either, lol), but I aim to understand who he is and show him that he matters to me because he does. Salt of the Earth, you are [[salient]] to me.
