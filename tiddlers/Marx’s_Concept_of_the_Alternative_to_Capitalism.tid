title: Marx’s Concept of the Alternative to Capitalism

As usual, deconstruction is far easier than construction. 

I'm pleased to see another view on Marx's critique and use of Hegel. From what I can tell, Hegel doesn't need to be an idealist either to some extent, particularly if we deny contingency. That which arises just is necessary for the absolute spirit. Hegel's ethics blows. Marx at least attempts to say something, but I'm still not convinced he has a sufficient view in metaethics.

I'm pleased to see Marx is a lifelong defender of democracy.

‘It makes every man see in other men not the realisation of his own freedom, but the barrier to it’

That's about right. In the end, the process might be what is respected. I am convinced [[The Original Position]] is a starting point Marx needs. There be the metaethics.

<<<
He writes, ‘Constructing the future and settling everything for all times is not our concern’. He does not want to ‘dogmatically anticipate’ the new world. Instead, he wants ‘to find the new world through criticism of the old one’.

I can agree to some extent. I call it tentpegs and Bob turtles. I also don't think Marx should be responsible for solving everything (nor any other individual), though we must do our best.

This is one of the reasons I'm constructing my prescriptive construction the way I have, btw. Maximizing the resilience of democracy and the virtuous knowledge of its participants has to be right. I'm not in a position to say much beyond: decentralize power [[irwartfrr]] (practically a truism).

The ideal towards which we must strive, Marx contends, is to unmask and transcend ‘human self-estrange-ment’ in the ‘unholy forms’ of existing society. This cannot be achieved with-out  a philosophy based on ‘the categorical  imperative  to overthrow  all  relationsin  which  man  is  a  debased,  enslaved,  forsaken,  despicable  being’.

Preach, yo. =) I've never seen this before.
