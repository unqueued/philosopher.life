Should let the wood do all the talking. It's loud (though not noisy).

My brother had a good day yesterday. Both parties were fun and didn't take too many spoons. Good! 

We talked about the substantial discussion in friendship again. My brother continues to ask excellent questions, and I continue to have no resolution to the issue. Of course, part of the problem is that I can't effectively define [[The Good]], which makes it difficult to define [[The Good]] life of humans and friendships in some non-trivial way. I think we are engaged in philosophical, contemplative living with each other (or ought to be).

My brother is doing his woodworking by hand. I know he's worried about it, but I'm not worried at all. I think even if he has a mistake, he'd find a way to capitalize on it and actually show it off.

We talked a bit about [[The Remodeling]] and my job hunt. 

His workplace is hell. He's undergoing backbreaking work. 

We talked about [[Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell]] and [[Mostly 4 Millennials]]. I will never be as talented at curating for my brother as he is for me (though, I can't say I'm very good at curating for myself either?). I will keep trying though. I'd like to be able to repay him in salience.
