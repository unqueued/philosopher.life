!! If money wasn't an issue, what kind of house would you have?

Why, Lady Melisandre, you give me the wish of wishes, yet again. I cannot tell you what [[The Original Position]] must look like all the way down (I can't by definition). Since I am allowed to speak in functions which I cannot resolve (but presumably you can, my genie), I would choose that complete remodeling of the world which fits [[The Moral Law]] [[irwartfrr]].

I would like to have a house, but I cannot say I will ever have one.
