!! About:

//Sharpen your [[blades|Poem: Recycling "The Blockchain Blade"]] and commit yourself, [[righteous]] disciple-assassin. Split, pull, kite, mez, tank, spank, stun, crit, pop CDs and consumables, abuse the geometry, cheese, coup de grâce, savor, and `/dance`, Platonic Guardian. Roll NBG, rinse and repeat. Grind, customize & modularize your UI lenses, fuck the ~~police~~ devs, automate and macro in all layers, mine packets, finetune config, securely virtualize, multibox, hack the console, drop them tentpegs, and minmax like an anointed grandmaster 4eak, you Psykotic Uber Goober.//

Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, of tent-dwelling women most blessed.

He asked water and she gave him milk, she brought him curds in a lordly bowl.<<ref "v">>

She put her hand to the tent peg and her right hand to the workmen’s mallet;

she struck Sisera a blow, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.

-- The Song of Deborah, Judges 5:24-26

My cup runneth over, I'm guilty, you are blowing my mind, cool story bro, I assent to your preaching, your truthtelling makes me feel [[hope]]less, my rage knows no bounds, plz allow me to slap a qualifier on that badboi, ur stupid & evil,<<ref "nu">> or someone ~~on the internet~~ in [[The Great Human Conversation]] is wrong.<<ref "g">> Therefore, I must lustfully empty myself [[irwartfrr]] into this raw and flavorful log for the sake of the wiki. Philosophy has always been a memetic martial art. Let's kindly slit some throats, sniff and gobble them assholes, unleash the beast, blow our wads, feast like perilous angels, mercilessly nitpick, slurp out the creampie marrow, and celebrate merit with ~~arbitrarily-contextualized New Criticism~~ due process.

Spoutin' off in [[Prompted Introspection]] has taught me many lessons about myself and how to reason about my [[4DID]] representation in this wiki. While [[Leet]] and necessary, unfortunately, that log's questions are too fucking vanilla to sufficiently achieve the crucial scaffolding [[reconstructive|DOR]] dialectical and horcrux-pensieve practices of pulling myself into the wiki all on its own. I need to rapidly wrestle with fit [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]] to extrema. I must tango with spicy [[antipleonasms]], fire paint out of my asshole, and habitually increment the [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]. Sometimes I will be extra fucking violent, unhinged, and unhedged in here; this is the bloodthirsty Darwinian hypercompetitive dialectical gladiator pit dojo. Ready to get got? `/roar`

Unlike [[Prompted Introspection]], which is designed to eliminate my autonomy in topic selection, this log will enable me to pick out what matters to me in whatever timeframe I see fit.<<ref "cf">> This is a different method for extracting the full bouquet of my bias. Instead of facing whitebread blah, this naughty pulsating project is meant to have me vivise~~x~~ctually dive into soundbites of curry, mole, essential extractions, vivid herbs, durian, fresh coffee, vegemite, bourbon neat, 90% dark chocolate, vinegar, and ต้มยำกุ้ง. Gah, where is the salty [[salience]]? `/summon`

With guts, take me to the logos-limit, eros.<<ref "n">> `/g INCOMING! ONE MOB PER MESSAGE!`

!! Principles:

* Wra'stle and wrangle them [[antipleonasms]]. Wisely blow shit up. Find the real sculpture inside that marble slab.
* Be flexible, voracious, and hunt for something that strikes you as [[salient]].
* Incubate and curate feeder lists like [[Generic Prompts]], otherwise use [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]].
* Tangent and speak gibberish if you must. It is difficult to be articulate enough about these crystalline memes.
* Preface: "Respond to the following gem:"
* If you wish, whimsically pick out the [[salient]] antipleonasm and gutturally respond to it. Your selection is hereby [[/b/]]ified.

!! Focus:

<<<
America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.

Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.
