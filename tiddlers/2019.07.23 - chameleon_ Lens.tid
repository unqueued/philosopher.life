Dear chameleon,

It's great to hear from you. While I'm writing slowly to you, I have been reading what you write on your wiki. You have a wonderful lens. You'll have to forgive me for being so ridiculously slow; that may not be conventionally acceptable. I ask you to take as long as you need to reply as well.

(wow it's been a while since I made ascii text)
<<<

It is dripping, haunting, and bright. It's gorgeous! Thank you. [[kickscondor]] has also made [[beautiful]] text art in our [[hyperconversation]], and I cherish it.<<ref "t">> Art is one of those gifts I hang onto (even if irrationally in some cases). I am, of course, enjoying all of your text art. I tried making one of Kona, but I decided not to post it. I just like [[yours|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Text%20Art%3A%20Kona]] more. 

<<<
Thanks again for your letter. It isn't often that I get long-form correspondence outside of my professional life.
<<<

It is my pleasure. I'm surprised you get non-boiler plate long-form correspondence in your professional life. You must be an actual professional, unlike me, lol. I don't know much about programming though beyond a job I had long ago. I just dabble.

The traces I get to see of your life are fascinating, btw. 

<<<
Over the last few days (the workweek) I've been taking a deep dive into your wiki, learning a lot and making plans of my own to learn more. I realise now how difficult an undertaking your wiki must've been; mine is just barely taking shape as I write this. 
<<<

I can see your work has been explosive.<<ref "i">> You've been blowing [[Recent]] up. Your work is so fresh it needs to go live with its aunty and uncle in Belair.

Working on it each day will snowball. I see you've made a lot of design decisions I wish I knew to make back when I started my wiki. You will find that I have no idea what I'm doing all too often. It seems to me that you already understand more about the mechanics of TW than I do, lol.

Yes, this wiki has been an insanely difficult project. I have shed many tears, spent many late nights, and annoyed all who know me (I can never shut up about it). I'm glad I have integrated it so much into my life. I will be interested to know know where you go with the relationships between tooling like emacs and TW. 

<<<
I still have to create a [[Philosophy]] page and outline my <<tag Ideology>> in more detail; it's nothing but broad strokes and strongly held positions for now. So I can hardly blame you for being a bit disorganized :)
<<<

It's a trainwreck; it is what it is. It's going to take decades to have a semblance of anything I'm satisfied with. It's a hard problem, and I'm too often blind. I appreciate how honest, diligent, and organized you are in your creation. There is a great deal of structure to your wiki.

<<<
I'm unsure if I'm autistic myself - a childhood test came up negative, but the pediatrician said I showed the signs - but I am definitely not neurotypical, and have always found autistic people easier to befriend.
<<<

I often find autistic people easier to befriend too. I mean this as a compliment, you are joyously weird. I adore your honesty; it is one of those traits I prize above almost all others in the pursuit of wisdom. Weirdness and honesty are a painful mix sometimes.

Autism often presents differently in females. My wife is autistic (that and schizophrenia run in both our families; our offspring are in for a treat), but most would never know. I'm grateful to have the people in my life who speak autistic.

<<<
>I wish we all had more trusted friends to share the stories of our lives with.

Much agreed!
<<<

Are the dearest people in your life also not so neurotypical? Do they read your wiki too? What do they think of it?

<<<
On a deeper reading, your wiki makes more sense. Perhaps it can be put down to my previous delves being of the "bored-at-work" variety, when my mind is normally in a bit of a haze, so I'm not really in the right headspace to read philosophy. So, on the contrary and after a much deeper delve and WikiWalk, I'd like to say your work is more transparent than I had earlier realised... At least, I feel like your "position" is starting to crystallise in my mind's eye.
<<<

High praise, thank you. I like the term WikiWalk. There is a kind of hypertext journey to exploring wikis, no doubt. You will find I'm not the most skilled WikiWalker, but I do my best. I am not a good interpreter in many contexts.

<<<
The [[Stories]] I was referring to are very private at the moment. If you'll forgive the hardware analogy, my real name, address, etc. are ring0, whereas my stories are ring1... For now, they'll stay private, though I might go into the metadata.
<<<

I'm there with you. I get it. I have had to make a lot of difficult decisions in this particular arena. 

I am a big fan of unifying my self-representation and having one place that pieces it all together (even if only in shambles). This may be of no use to you, but you may find it useful to have two wikis, one private and the other public (public being inside or extracted from the private). Going the nodejs route is significantly easier in a number of respects for this kind of tooling. Use a public tag (safer than using a private tag), and when you want to post to your webserver, parse the the .tids for what is tagged Public, push them to another directory, and compile from there (unless you are just serving for nodejs, which is not my preference even if most people appear to do so). 

<<<
Perhaps if we pursue the penpal route further, I can show them to you, though I will have to get the assurance that you're not going to mirror them or methods to access them on the wiki, due to their private nature.
<<<

I would be really sad if we don't penpal. I'm not here for some short-term thing unless that's all we get to have together.<<ref "s">> I'm sometimes a slow and painful person to speak with, but I am listening and thinking with you. 

Despite the tension, I beg people to be pseudonymous and yet radically open.<<ref "tw">> I have had several people show me their private thoughts who trust me to reason about it on their behalf. I do not prefer to hold anything I'm not allowed to talk about aloud unless it is my moral obligation. As weird as this may sound, I aim to transparently hold secrets. If I choose not to say something, I want it to be evident that I had a [[good]] reason for it. 

For now, I'm going to ask you to post what you are willing to show everyone (which is wonderfully open). I believe I should earn the right to see and reason about your private writing. I am grateful that you are willing to trust me, and I want to openly establish I'm worthy of it. It is my honor to grow a friendship with you.

<<<
As much as anything, the Darger reference was for myself :D I really need to make a [[Henry Darger]] <<tag Senpai>> page. Even if I'll likely never read Realms of the Unreal, that sort of dedication to art, art for its own sake, is a distant dream of mine, and a literal, direct inspiration for much of my own art.
<<<

I look forward to understanding the art of your life. Wikis cannot capture everything but perhaps as much as one feasibly can. It's such a gunky and yet organized medium. I'm super excited to see how your work evolves over the years.

<<<
Still, I don't think the wiki is a waste. I share your views on art, for the most part, especially the maximization of art, if you'll forgive the oversimplification. So, I propose that your wiki in-itself is art, certainly art to [[me.|chameleon]]
<<<

Thank you. I'm still on the hunt for what counts as [[Art]] too. I don't meet many people who are maximalist and inclusive in their definitions of it. I'm learning to appreciate that dedication to a distant dream of art for its own sake.

Why do you make art? I know you just said it, but it is not easy for me to wrap my mind around.

<<<
Have no fear! Apology accepted, and you've already done more than enough to make it up to me, I dare say, with your response! But a response-response-response (a response to this letter) would also be appreciated, of course :)

I'd like to ask the past me to stop being such a [[Twitter]] addict and not to assume based on a cursory glance, especially not as soon as I see a certain popular philosopher!

//facepalm @ myself// 
<<<

Thank you. I intend to respond, though I fail sometimes. It seems to be part of my protocol to be "dogmackic" (dogmatically ack-ing). 

You appear to have far more grace here than I do. I hope you will be able to let me off the hook for my legion of unfortunate twitter-like moments too. I'm especially prone to lack a robustly hedged-conservative tongue. I regularly shoot myself in the foot which I then have to put in mouth. I aim to be kind, and preferably nice. Sometimes I'm just stupid or evil, and my dearest friends sacrificially point this out to me.

<<<
Don't worry about "nrx", it was an ill-conceived comment. And if you do, just read [[El Sandifier's book instead.|https://www.amazon.com/Neoreaction-Basilisk-Essays-Around-Alt-Right-ebook/dp/B0782JDGVQ]] Having read it myself, it seems like the sort of thing you might enjoy - a bizarre, Eldritch-philosophy deep-dive into some of the internet's strangest thinkers.
<<<

That book looks terrifying to me. Thank you for the recommendation.  

<<<
I've come to have a greater respect for Kant in the year or so since I made that comment, even if I can't really agree with (what I interpret as) his philosophy (quite yet).

...

>You are correct, I'm especially indebted to Saint Kant. He is a difficult man to wrestle with.

Hence my embarrassment at my snap judgement!

I feel like I need to read the man first-hand. At the moment my knowledge is drip-fed, second hand explanations, moral arguments, and Philosophy Tube memes.
<<<

He's a beast I keep having to reinterpret. He gets strong reactions out of me all over the place, but I'm still unable to answer him satisfactorily. I feel fortunate to have second-hand explanations because he's almost impenetrable for me in some cases. His metaethics is the centerpiece of his work for me. Here's hoping we both feel like we understand him a decade from now, eh? 

<<<
You're very welcome. I personally see myself as a weird internet stranger, if I'm honest, so hopefully this can be a peer-to-peer conversation, and hopefully as a team we attract more of [[The Weird]] to our sphere of internetworkery. If you want to know just how "out-there" I get, keep an eye on <<tag Waifuism>>.
<<<

Fuck yeah! I think helping people have their own voice is one of my callings, and I hope to participate in a community in which we all own the memes of production from soup to nuts.

Your Waifuism is weird for the normies. The lines I draw in the sand are about what is moral rather than conventional. While I may not be able to appreciate it thoroughly enough, it's not too out there for me. I probably won't understand chanspeak as well as you deserve, I have a history I cherish with that community. I find it delightful that you speak up from a perspective which is generally persecuted in many circles. I adore that you are comfortable [[letting it out|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Expert%20Wikier]]. You don't present merely a face, and I admire your courage. 

About the [[FTO Mode: Alien]], I mean it as a guest I've not even begun to understand. [[FTO Mode: P2P]] is always my goal.

<<<
Thank you very much for the "single-file firefox" pointer, and for keeping the browser addon information on your wiki. It's through that that I finally bit the bullet and got this bad boy set up. It's a single page served by my web server - [[How to make a wiki]] roughly describes my wiki-workflow as of the time of writing.
<<<

I'm glad it was a useful bungee jump cord for you to take the plunge. I have been watching it unfold. For philosophical, political, and technical reasons, I'm a huge fan of serving static files, especially a unified (bloated in my case) singlefile. I'm probably over-the-top irrational about it even. 

<<<
Bob sounds interesting though.
<<<

It's been getting better, and it was the reason I jumped ship from singlefile. There are still a lot of problems I face with it, but it has been getting better. Bugs disappear when you upgrade, and if you build around the assumption it will fail at times, you will be better off for it in the end. At this point, I could not imagine living without the tool. It is uncommon that I pay money for software, but I do pay for that.

I strongly recommend moving to Bob as soon as you feel able. 

<<<
Can I convert my singlefile wiki to one others can edit? I'd be interested in doing so, that way [[my husband|The Abyssal]] can add to the wiki too!
<<<

This is technically possible, and I think it is reasonable if you have strong synchronization and do not have overlapping. It's like asking if you can edit from seperate devices, imho. There are some race conditions you will face, and you'd need to find a way to meaningfully merge those conflicts or never have them in the first place through behavioral conventions.

You could also parse the wiki as singlefile or break into .tids, then automate the merging given timestamps (throwing up errors for exceptions/conflicts). 

Bob is the best tool for simultaneous access to the wiki. It likely handles this problem better than anything you are going to devise by hand. It's often the case on Sundays, during [[Family Time]], that all 4 of us will be editing my wiki (or our offspring's, who also use Bob). 

Hey, maybe your husband would want to make his own wiki too!

I'm interested in how you set up [[your|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.07.25%20-%20WikiWoes]] own [[RGM]].

<<<
The other thing I'd like to ask is - how do you add a little bit of space to the left of the pages in your wiki? On mine, when fullscreen on a 1080p monitor, the lines are too long.
<<<

I don't know what you are mean here. Could you take a screenshot and draw on it for me? I probably still won't know the answer, but I'll see what I can do.

<<<
I'd also love to know how you make those creative footnotes, which seem to work with arbitrary text.
<<<

$:/macros/danielo/footNote is what I use. There are a few footnote tools around, so you might want to have a look. Also, this place is a treasure trove: https://dynalist.io/d/zUP-nIWu2FFoXH-oM7L7d9DM. All the mad lootz.

<<<
Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. Looking forward to an engaging penpallery :)

- [[chameleon]]
<<<

Me too! 

Btw, [[kicks]] wrote about your wiki [[here|https://www.kickscondor.com/chameleon's-wiki/]].

Your [[Development Levels|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Development%20Levels]] is something I've pondered. I have no idea how to do it well enough. I tag things as a Draft or [[/b/]], but epistemic status is another barrel of monkeys. Trying to cleanly (and rapidly) navigate backlink relationships or understanding the centrality of a particular tiddler to the rest of the wiki is one place I want to go (don't think that will be happening anytime soon). I'm also reminded some of [[this|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles]]. I still have no idea what I'm doing on these fronts, lol. I'm not really sure when something is finished; I put timestamped footnotes in older journal entries though. In any case, I think it's awesome that you are starting out your wiki with all this in mind. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
