title: 2018.12.03 - Prompted Introspection: Dressing Differently

!! Why do some people choose to dress differently?

This is a classic [[Redpill]]ed question for me as an autist and ethicist. I am reminded of this prompt: [[2017.06.22 - Prompted Introspection Log]].

Most people choose to dress as a signal to the other primates around them. Our limbic systems generate blink-of-eye inductive, probabilistic emotional inferences that we can't even consciously attend to. Whether or not our species "ought" to be this way (or "ought" to eliminate it through morally fair signal control) is a different issue (however ridiculously important it is).

I openly rebuke the claim that fashion is a profound expression of who we are (or your identity is NPC shallow), though it is a valuable signal in some cases. Most people will even agree to some semblance of that claim (to a point). It is clear, however, that they are not willing to look inside and see that they aren't really trying to be rational about it (and, ofc, we can only be so rational; I'm not denying our [[fff]] circumstances). 

To dress differently from the rest of the human herd is generally a signal that you want to be seen as different. You'll note, for example, that when someone moves to a new area, if they adopt the customs and appearances then they are non-verbally (perhaps even subconsciously) claiming the move was a status improvement to their identity. Those who maintain their customs are expressing something like the opposite.

My wife is eclectic in her style. She has turned punk recently. I don't know what the hairstyle is called, but the right side of (leaving the top alone) her head is buzzcut, and she keeps it curly. Students who are otherwise oppressed by admin and the Christian college see a signal that they can trust her. I admire that.

Dressing differently, like any kind of communication, can serve crucial purposes.
