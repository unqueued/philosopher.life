** Uh, maybe I'm lacking humility here, but this seems obvious to me. People who start collecting money by happenstance can only give 1 away per turn. This is a huge bottleneck. There will eventually be some strong winners that appear to prevail. But, even more importantly, given a sufficient amount of time, clearly everyone in the room will eventually, at some point, have had basically all the money minus one (the one they gave away, assuming one must give to another).

** A fascinating problem. We've known it for a while. Company's are loathe to pay people for their work, of course.
** I don't know why Apple doesn't just start throwing more money at it. I assume it would be a price-arms-race with other bidders.

** Could The Atlantic hug the DNC's nuts any tighter in their mouths? 
** Dewey and Rorty are pragmatists, no doubt. Go ahead and shoot at the fabled ivory tower. Or, how about you grow a fucking pair and try to answer the philosophical problem of post-modernism itself. You will see that even pragmatism may fail you when you needed it most. It's a serious skeptical problematic, and you can't sweep it under the rug. Further, compromise is much harder than it appears at first glance. In some cases, it is not obviously possible.
** I don't blame The Left. I blame the idiots not listening to The Left, which is most of humanity.<<ref "1">>
*** You can't reliably fix a problem without first identifying it. The Left may not have the answer, but they are still miles closer to one than the rest of you lot.
