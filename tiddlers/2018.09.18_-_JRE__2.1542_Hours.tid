title: 2018.09.18 - JRE: 2.1542 Hours

My brother called me! His voice is just now starting to come back, and he can ignore the pain on the meds. We talked about how he's doing. It sounds like he's coming out of the gate of hell here. He's down to 249 pounds too, lol. Sleep positioning options are already better. He does not regret it, and he's going to have fun with the doctor about how painful it has been. It's outstanding to hear him in good spirits. The load is lighter!

We talked about [[Find The Others]]. It is a very different experience, and I appreciate his thinking about it with me. I love that my brother openly recognizes that I am autistic; I enjoy that he makes fun of me for it in a graceful way. I told him that I ended up contacting many people I trust over our conversation to ask for their advice as well.

He believes it is not safe for me to speak to [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] both psychologically and legally. Even he is now keeping them at bay more stringently. He says something weird is happening. I am paying very close attention, sir.

In a regretful way, he says he has a hard time explaining what they did wrong (although, he seems to think they did serious damage to us). One move he makes: all parents screw up their kids. I talked about the [[dok]] issue (some evil really is more evil than others). We talked about the perceptual distortion, and I can appreciate why it's hard to explain it.

He noted that I tend to have two kinds of modes on my wiki (at least sometimes): one is extremely emotional (angry, etc.), and the other is very cold and calculated. He initially guessed that I was taking my emotions and slowly rewriting them into something cold and calculated. The primacy issue, even for me, is not resolved. This is clearly [[Self-Dialectic]] territory. I thanked my brother for seeing something extremely important to me in my wiki. That is empathy!

I asked if he wanted a cold, calculated expression of what they've done wrong. He said, "yes." I have considered it. I'm not so sure my brother would find it useful though. I voiced my concern that at the bottom of what made it wrong would be a rich set of moral axioms (that's what makes the argument actually logical!). I don't think he wants to engage in that reasoning, but I also think it's one of his fundamental struggles. We talked about tentpegs and wandered on this issue. This is a very influential problem for us.

We talked about his woodworking, his knowledge and tools may be prepping him for a partial transition. He's trying to find a way to enter the field under the table. His friend Tobiah is a carpenter, and it's clear that my brother is wildly more prepared. Sometimes, I wish my brother would just go [[Polymath Craftsman Log]]. He could do it, and he would love it. 

He is worried about me. I am touched that he aggressively pursues my health. He counsels that I keep the ketamine ready at the hip. ''I do, and I will.'' We walked through the signs that I need it. I'm not there, and I fight the wolf; I must keep him off my back at all costs, drowning me, forcing those goggles over my eyes.<<ref "i">> He can see the difference with the ketamine.

We joked about my cultic personality and ideas.<<ref "w">> He half-jokingly said he has signed up for it. We talked about different actual cults, I made a joke about our donors' business pattern, and we continued joking about my autism. //Children of h0p3// is the official name. First rule, don't talk about //Children of h0p3//. We have secret handshakes, I forget what the formal "goodbye" was, and my brother says he will be the enforcer. Lol.

Talked about Charlie a bit. He wants to get to know Charlie more. I think my brother would find the man fascinating. Charlie is literally an idiot savant, a special genius. It is one of the reasons my wife and I immediately connect.

We talked for a couple hours. I'm really glad we did. It has felt like forever.

As usual, my memory of conversations over the phone is pretty poor. What the fuck is happening to me? 25 years ago, I would have repeated the conversation to you almost word for word (or so I remember...). I swear I can feel my memory getting even worse and worse (even more signs of depression and other things). Let us hope I solve what I must before I lose what faculties I have.

 Also, her reaction and others reactions to their doxing reminds conjured up a little image
25 minutes ago
 You open your door, a stranger walks in says hi, says they like your furniture, then they stand behind your curtain, like a retarded kid playing hide and seek

 The worst part is that she has a non-trivial chance of reading these words. /wave
23 minutes ago
 Oh, im not calling her retarded
23 minutes ago

 Someone else walks in, says hi
21 minutes ago
 They say, anyone else come by recently?
21 minutes ago
 At this point you are wondering how they havent noticed that person behind the curtain
20 minutes ago
 So you have to recognize that hiding behind that curtain is an attempt at seeking privacy
20 minutes ago
 Just a really retarded one
20 minutes ago
 lol
19 minutes ago
 To what extent are we all supposed to say as a group "oooooh no, i dont see where little johnny went??"
19 minutes ago
 Or is their intention enough to require us to not point out their obvious hiding spot
18 minutes ago
 And just to be clear, she seems way smarter and more knowledgable than me about how to actually hide her identity
17 minutes ago
 Seriously, saw all your letters to each other, and it made me a hardcore sense of imposter syndrome
16 minutes ago
 Made me feel*
15 minutes ago
 I feel the weight of your argument. I really do think that people have to work harder to secure their anonymity and privacy (I think it is our moral duty...it's a kind of literacy in the 21st century). Exactly how to draw those lines, I do not know. I try to play by fairly tame rules of exploring the identities of others online. I think it's important that we can talk about the people standing in the room though as they've presented themselves. Kickscondor clearly has secured his anonymity against me (since I'm resolute on being gentle).
14 minutes ago
 I really appreciate how much thought Sphygmus put into wrestling with the issue.
14 minutes ago
 You could learn to hide your identity quite well, imho.
14 minutes ago
 Ooor, i can sharpen these chisels.... hmmm
14 minutes ago
 Lol
13 minutes ago
 no, seriously
13 minutes ago
 The fact that you know how to fire up a Tor browser and play by some basic rules puts you lightyears ahead of most people, imho.

<<footnotes "i" "I am reminded of how effective House is at determining he is dreaming or hallucinating across the seasons. Obviously, I will never be so skilled. I have read some of self-check habits of lucid dreamers which produce the right disposition and openness to questioning the nature of their reality. Sometimes I think I have some of that skill in various modes and respects (of course, what delusional person wouldn't? :P); it's part of being a good philosopher escaping the cave. I hope to cultivate the self-awareness, to know which goggles I'm wearing, etc. without too much effort. It is a painful enterprise.">>

<<footnotes "w" "While running an errand with my wife today, she was telling me about how much she loves being able to say 'hey, google.' My immediate response was: 'you mean, you love that your phone is constantly listening to you?' She told me even the family members of the prophets don't listen. I'm not even being prophetic here; this is baby shit. I can't even convince my wife. Am I retarded? Maybe. We laughed at the absurdity.">>
