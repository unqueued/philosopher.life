P is a necessary truth. It's truth (and existence, imho) is given from nothingness. It's a big ball of all necessary truths. Are there any necessary truths which arise from something but not nothing? I don't see how. That seems to miss the point, ofc. 

But, we are in [[The Dialetheia]] territory. I may never be humble enough before it.
