!! Audit:

* I'm still wandering in my Prompted Introspection Logs. It isn't bad, but it also isn't great. 
* Weekends seem the most productive days on the wiki.
* Magic, EQ, League, DND. Someone is in search of a drug.
* I ended the [[Philosophy Probe Log]]. It wasn't bearing the fruit I wanted. I should feel free to spin them up and end them. Again, take risks and shotgun approach.
* Not only did I do a good job of speaking with myself, but I feel like my family heard me too in our family meetings.
* The frustrations of the job hunt did not last very long. 
* There were several disruptions and a lack of direction this month, but it seemed to even out. I think the wiki may be in part responsible for that. 
* I think the DNSmasq trick has helped. I need to automate it moreso.
* I really didn't move my links. I don't feel like it. Sometimes, I'm just not in the mood to do this work. It doesn't exactly feel like procrastination, but there is something similar to it. 
* I think adding Samwise Gamgee has been hilarious. Is it another incarnation of Bobert?
* The script has been immensely useful. I like making my life easier. Maybe that's how I should do the links?
* I straight up miss Cannabis. I'm not as happy without it. I don't see myself being able to do anything about it for a long time.
* I haven't talked to my friend ALM as much as I'd have liked. I'm not always sure what we would talk about.
* I didn't really get to make a ton of DIY tools. I do have the flange wrench and 8 dogs almost finished. That's a good start.
* So much fireman time.
* I seem to rotate between my various gaming drugs. Nothing seems to be holding my attention for long. Even League barely holds it.
* I need to compare my calorie average intakes over the months. I've felt fatter this month.
* I complimented myself more this month than I usually do. That's perfectly reasonable.
** When you do a good job, you do a good job.
