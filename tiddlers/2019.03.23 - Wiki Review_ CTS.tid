title: 2019.03.23 - Wiki Review: CTS

* [[2019.03.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Free Expression]]
** Edited.
** This isn't quite right either. Too often, I have no excellent response to Chomsky; his arguments are fairly watertight, and when they aren't, it's not easy to demonstrate it.
* [[2019.03.22 - Afterschool Teaching: Cleanup]]
** Completed.
** I am rarely that openly personal with those who have power over me. Well, I hope it doesn't bite me in the ass, but I desperately want to be honest.
* [[2019.03.22 - Prompted Introspection: Inventions Since 1985]]
** Edited.
** It's interesting to see who thinks it may be coming and how they react.
* [[2019.03.22 - Wiki Review: Rambling]]
** Hey, it's almost entirely not up to you. That doesn't mean you can't improve. Be fair.
* [[2019.03.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Noice]]
** Completed.
** [[CTS]] is sometimes taking up more time. [[TDL]] and [[Review]] have as well. It's good to see the core taking up time; I often am not as reflective as I would like to be.
* [[2019.03.22 - TDL: Deep Clean]]
** Yeah, it's hard to tell what is the best use of my time here. Perhaps I should just go with the flow. 
* [[2019.03.22 - Music Exploration: Halcyon Seed]]
** That is a terrible sign. If it doesn't matter, why record it? Just explore, right?
*** Science, bitch.
* [[2019.03.22 - Link Log: Puke]]
** A surprising portion of those links are directly relevant to what I'm doing in this wiki.
