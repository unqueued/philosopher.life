We talked for a bit before he put Raylan to bed. I listened to his infinite patience. 

We talked about a conversation with Carolyn over FB. She is garbage. I am surprised he even tries. They have demonstrated multiple times they have no interest in a dialectic. It is a [[T42T]] violation. He doesn't want to become Bob, and I'm glad to see him fight it. I continued to make my case against using that medium, and he acknowledged it while adding significant ammo.
