!! Stages of Positive Disintegration: 

* Level One – Primary Integration
** Primary Integration is the most basic, primitive level of development. This level is driven by the first factor, with the satisfaction of basic needs and desires as the individual’s only concerns. Those at this level (generally young children) have no need for deep or meaningful relationships with others, and disregard empathy, sympathy, or any acknowledgement of the needs and concerns of others.

* Level Two – Unilevel Disintegration
** Level two is governed by the second factor and focused on conformity and social comparison. In this level, the individual is concerned with “fitting in” and is easily influenced by their social group. Some individuals at this level will begin to question the values and beliefs imposed upon them by their social group, and will begin the process of discovering their own personal values and beliefs.

* Level Three – Multilevel Disintegration
** Individuals who began questioning their own beliefs and values in level two will begin to form their own beliefs and values in level three. They will notice the discrepancy between “the way things are” and “the way things ought to be,” a realization that will likely spark negative emotions, such as shame or guilt, as they look back on their mistakes and question themselves and their moral standing.

* Level Four – Directed Multilevel Disintegration
** The questioning and discovery of level three give way to increasingly goal- and value-directed behavior. The individual realizes who they are and who they want to be, and how they must act in order to be authentic. Those at level four truly care for others, and act in accordance with this empathy.

* Level Five – Secondary Integration
** The highest level of development in Dąbrowski’s theory is marked by alignment between personal values and behavior, and the individual tailors their actions to work towards higher goals such as the betterment of society in general. The individual has formed their ideal personality and experiences peace with one’s self. All motivation is in the higher forms of empathy, autonomy, and authenticity.



!! Frequently Less-Adaptive Coping Styles and Strategies:

* Becoming narcissistic. 
** Convincing myself of my own importance and that what I am doing is extremely important to the world.

* Knowing the “truth.” 
** Convince myself I'm right and know the truth. If I can convince myself that I know the truth about life and the universal meaning of existence, then I can gain comfort. Often, this illusion is accompanied by an intolerance for others’ questions, beliefs, or style of living.

* Trying to control life, or at least label it. 
** Convince myself that if I organize myself and my thinking in controlled, logic-tight compartments, then I can control life. Labels give an illusion of control. If I have power over things around me, then I have power over my life and my destiny.

* Learning to not think. 
** Sometimes it is simply less painful if I choose to just not think about things that matter, and certainly to avoid using critical thinking skills. I will selectively ignore areas of my life.

* Learning to not care. 
** Convincing myself not to care; it is less painful that way.

* Keeping busy. 
** Avoid facing difficult personal issues or my fear of empty space/time, during which I might be forced to face their issues, by keeping busy. 

* Seeking novelty. 
** Substituting aesthetic experience for authentic close relationships and meaningful self-examination.
 


!! Frequently More-Adaptive Coping Styles and Strategies:

* Coming to know oneself. 
** An individual must "separate the wheat from the chaff" when it comes to his or her values and perception of the world. One’s unique characteristics and personality must be recognized, valued, and accepted by oneself. 

* Becoming involved in causes. 
** Something beyond yourself to feel connected and worthwhile.

* Maintaining a sense of humor.
** If you push a tragedy far enough, into absurdity, it becomes a comedy. A sense of humor can ameliorate our feelings of hopelessness about existential issues.

* Touching and feeling connected. 
** Feed your skin contact hunger.

* Compartmentalizing. 
** Just because people are upset in one area of their life does not mean that they should be miserable about everything.

* Letting go. 
** People who are intense often try to impose their will on the world around them in virtually all areas yet find themselves unsatisfied or unhappy with the outcome. Let it go, and go with the flow.

* Living in the present moment. 
** Living in such a way makes it easier to deal with whatever you are doing at the present moment. People in disintegrative states often focus heavily on the past or on the future, which looks so bleak to them, rather than living in the present.

* Learning optimism and resiliency. 
** Optimism significantly affects how people respond to adversity and difficulty. Although there is a genetic predisposition toward optimism or pessimism, and even toward depression, depression is greatly influenced by how an individual has learned to react to what happens in his or her life. 

* Focusing on the continuity of generations. 
** For some, focusing on the continuity of generations—children and grandchildren—is comforting.

* Being aware of “rippling.” 
** Butterfly effect. Each of us creates—often without our conscious intent or knowledge—concentric circles of influence that may affect others for years, even for generations.
