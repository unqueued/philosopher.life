!! Audit:

* I only get to be part of myself on the job. It's still not working.
* I never figured out what happened to Lucas
* I've grown a lot over the past month.
* I've used every tool I own on the jobsite, except the chalk line (no chalk in it though).
** I have many tools I've not been able to bring.
* I need a more complete toolbox.
* I need a 4' toolbox of sorts for the longer tools.
* I need a large aluminum pipewrench
* I'm very lucky to have learned and practiced with Chris-M
* Yates and my bosses are dicks
* I'm glad I continue the !! Break! points, but I need to make sure I don't fail to say what I need to about the end of the day.
* Some days this month clearly sucked hard.
* Our finances are much better.
* I kept struggling to find ways to be useful.
* IBEW makes a lot of sense. Of course, I can't start until June. I need to pick up another job between then and now. I can do it.<<ref "2018.12.03">>
** Maybe I should consider plumbing until then?
* I need to take the PLC classes
* I am proud of never missing a day or being actually late.
* I am pleased that I've stuck it out, although I didn't have to.
* Tons of spelling mistakes, but typing on a phone sucks.
* Greg is a smart cookie
* Magnets rocks.
* Mondays are rough. I need to smooth this out more.
* I am barely keeping my head above water.
* I feel like I'm slowing down on a job that is speeding up.
* The Pit sucks. Clearly, too many don't give a shit about my safety. Do not believe their lies.
* It was great to see my old classmates. It felt like fate, somehow (which is ridiculous, I know).
* It is clear, after speaking to my old classmates, that I have come a very long way from where they are.
* The new tiddlywiki editor and bluetooth keyboard has got me back in business. I feel like I've expressed myself, and I think I've felt better at the end of each day because of it as well.
* I analyze social situations better when I can type.
