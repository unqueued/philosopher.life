title: 2018.12.19 - Seeking Sphygmus: Mile-high Start

So, I'm going to act like I know what I'm seeing (I'm probably going to be close!) and prepare for her correction. She reveals more after a mini-remodel.

The All-In-One button is productive! I will slowly get there too, lol.

I have explored the open sequence tiddlers (for a time, I had explored the entire thing, but I am uncomfortable responding to drafts [that may change in time]). I'm trying the [[Root]] entrance this time. I have noted that most people hate my [[Root]] entrance, but I'm not sure what to do {[[about]]} (;P) that. 

Sphygmus is using Unicode symbols to enable her to have the visual cues first in the title.

* 📝 := log
* 🎨 := art
* 📌 := project pin?
* 💀 := retired; "u ded" ;P

I need to think more about this. I've seen others approach this through different colored tags (which would never work for a colorblind person like me). The ability to glance at a list in a blink of an eye and without having read it while still immediately having a feel for what you are looking at (or where you are) is nothing to sneeze at. I fear my brain might not be wired to take advantage of this tool-approach either; I need to test.

//Focus://[[Root]] is [[Root]] for her. I am not convinced the [[APFVD]] structure is working for her (my teleology is so pointed that it makes sense to me, but I'm biased!), and I will be interested to see where she goes. I don't know how much she has in her private wiki either, nor I do know her goals with the wiki (I'm feeling like a bad friend for not being able to clearly articulate that).

I just noticed (bad vision) the "+" signs for "New Tiddler" here. I will be interested to see what happens if and when she has a hard time containing all the projects. I still haven't figured that one out.
