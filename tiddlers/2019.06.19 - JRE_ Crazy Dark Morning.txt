How are you doing?
WED 7:57 PM
Lots of emotional ups and down today, not necessarily tied to actual causes.
WED 8:02 PM
Interesting. I'm sorry. That sounds especially frustrating.
WED 8:03 PM
I like to know why I'm feeling the way I do.
WED 8:03 PM
Called doctors office Tuesday, left message asking whether I need to make an appointment to try new meds
WED 8:03 PM
Ended up telling me to drop by after work to pick up samples of a new one
WED 8:04 PM
Cool. =)
WED 8:04 PM
So today was the first day of transition
WED 8:04 PM
Ah
WED 8:04 PM
Felt crazy dark this morning
WED 8:04 PM
Sarah rodrian has pointed out to me several times how hard I am on myself, and turns out self-hatred can be dialed up
WED 8:05 PM
But by mid afternoon I felt a lot better, so hopefully that doesn't keep happening.
WED 8:06 PM
Before I took meds, I don't remember having such clear internal arguments about whether I'm a piece of shit in my head
WED 8:07 PM
Thought loops that feel like a self-imposed character assassination
WED 8:09 PM
Well, as I have said before, you are the best man I know.
WED 8:10 PM
I think you are being too hard on yourself too.
WED 8:10 PM
I am glad you are thinking about it.
WED 8:10 PM
I know you don't have much control over it either.
WED 8:10 PM
The thoughts aren't even arguments I can fight, they are just pure mental declarations.  You are garbage, you are evil, kill yourself, you are better dead
WED 8:11 PM
ugh. =(
WED 8:12 PM
I am sorry.
WED 8:12 PM
That is hell.
WED 8:12 PM
I'm sorry you are experiencing so much variance. I will be interested to see what it's like after a few days pass.
WED 8:12 PM
You should call me immediately for any reason whatsoever.
WED 8:12 PM
I would if it got super overwhelming
WED 8:13 PM
I love you, [[JRE]].
WED 8:14 PM
Its like that schizo woman, I can still tell they aren't worthy thoughts, but pointing them out to others doesn't make them less intrusive.  So its not like I totally agree with them, just a battle of the mind
WED 8:15 PM
Yes. It's gotta be crazy hard. I've not been in your exact shoes, but I've been in some similar ones.
WED 8:18 PM
[[j3d1h]] taught me a pickup line:
WED 8:20 PM
"Hey baby, I just shit my pants. Can I get into yours?"
WED 8:20 PM
Gonna wait for a gnarly fart and then say that to rebecca
WED 8:22 PM
There is a possibility I have found a source for cartridges.
