I am tickled watching [[xdo-delete-columns.xsh]]. Probably about the same time either way, but now I have a chmod'ed script to fuck around with and i3 is configured for it.

I'm still thinking about what I'll be doing for the kids here for X-mas here. My daughter demonstrated she can play WoW on her computer today, but that game is older than she is. $400 requires used parts across the board, I think. I could just buy a nice graphics card for both computers and be done, but that would be a huge mistake at least for the 2nd gen i3. I'm still trying to find a good route. I think this is simplified if I have two machines: one linux, one windows for the kids. Trying to guarantee passthrough with good stats on my budget isn't likely. My son would boot down for games, but my daughter wouldn't.
