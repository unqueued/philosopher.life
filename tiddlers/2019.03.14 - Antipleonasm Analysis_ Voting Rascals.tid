title: 2019.03.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Voting Rascals

!! Respond to the following gem:

Unfortunately, you can't vote the rascals out, because you never voted them in, in the first place.

I don't know what this claim is targeting, but I'm happy to read it out of context and into mine with facile New Criticism.

It's clear that our voting powers are illusory. We hold elections, but it's pure theater. There is, of course, a theoretical possibility that we could elect just anyone and revolutionize our government, but there is only an appearance of validity enough to generate and satiate optimism in reactionaries who have no intention of honestly evaluating the political state of affairs. It's a sham. I don't know if it has always been a sham or when it might have changed, but I don't know a great number of things.

It is clear that the will of the people is not represented by our governing institutions and basic structures. Voting matters to me, of course, as I outline in [[The Original Position]]. It's precisely because I have such strong standards that I can be so skeptically disappointed. My dismay is justified.

I think my only real point of contention is the use of "rascal," which is almost too playful in connotation for me.
