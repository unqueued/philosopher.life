Dear h0p3,

It is good to read your wiki! I was amused by the //Calendar// tiddler appearing today, when I just deleted my own tiddler that was meant to serve a similar purpose. I love my wiki, but trying to do time management in it just didn't work for me -- I hope it goes more successfully for you!

> I'll be interested to know if it is like riding a bicycle for you (assuming that plays any role), and insofar as it is still not a second skin after that, I'd like to know if you will be reaching for another second skin.

I'm not sure changing the color palette and other general styling of my wiki is exactly //substantial// work, but it feels like it was a good way to get comfortable again in my wiki -- like, relearning the controls in a video game after stepping away for a while. --- plus, I appreciate the spark of fun that really embracing the【﻿Ｏ　Ｕ　Ｔ　Ｒ　Ｕ　Ｎ】𝒶єŞŦ𝒽𝐞т𝕚ς has brought for me.

I'm definitely back on the //wiki review// and //carpe diem// horse again, knock on wood. My wiki reviews have almost become essays recently, which is interesting -- multi-paragraph long nested bullet points and so forth. 

> It's not a mere performance to me, but I'm your audience and friend...I am interested to know how you are doing and what you're thinking!

So I mentioned in my last letter the QuestBridge conference in San Francisco I went to, and how that would probably be a letter all to itself. I want to preface this by saying ''thank you'', thank you, thank you. For listening and telling me you're listening. I don't think I've mentioned it before, but I'm the eldest of two and --

I've grown a lot, socially. I've grown a ''lot'' since being a junior high girl in a sweatshirt dress<<footnote "sew" "Take a sweatshirt and sew a long strip of flannel or other fabric around the bottom to get an article of clothing I wore a lot as a kid in fall & winter. I...wouldn't be caught dead in one now but they were comfortable and warm and I was already weird so I don't remembering thinking anything of it then.">> walking every school day afternoon to an 8th grade public art class with maybe 15 or 20 other students and feeling overwhelmed, shy, and intimidated.<<footnote "snk" "and super snarky in my head? and also checking people out? man -- I think about who I was then and I think quiet--shy--nerdy--dork but I really don't give myself enough credit for being spunky and passionate and interested and gutsy and opinionated, especially in my journals!">>

Sorry -- this is a letter to you but so much of writing ''to'' someone is about noticing what is important to me<<footnote "hp" "like -- when I'm writing to myself it's a feedback loop but when I'm writing //for// someone else it's new and I'm not just telling myself the same thing over and over. does that make sense?">> and so, for myself, I want to take out this footnote and highlight it really big:

!!! I really don't give myself enough credit for being spunky and passionate and interested and gutsy and opinionated, especially in my journals!

''Storytelling'', and telling the stories of ourselves, was the rough organizing theme in one of the conference's keynotes. The guy was the sort who usually gets chosen for these kinds of keynotes -- rough early life, goes to college, works for Google, goes into Investment Banking, blah blah. I'm sure there were several pithy points of advice woven into the keynote -- and he was successful at being a charismatic and gripping speaker -- but I think the rough organizational idea was more interesting than the speech itself. 

How do we tell ourselves the stories of our past? What language do we use? How does that shape our memories and how we view ourselves in the present -- and how does that affect the ''actions'' we take every day?

I had this moment of realization at the conference, as I was eating breakfast standing at a table with two other women: If a clone of me had walked into that room at that moment, she could have assumed that I was yet another person who already had friends and a group and interesting conversations and that she was the only person walking into the crowd with no one she already knew to eat with.

How many of the conversations happening around me did I assume, by default, were just people who already knew each other? And what disservice did I do to myself and other people through excluding myself by default because of that assumption?

I had an argument with my co-worker one Saturday, along the lines of "what makes art art?" A key part of his definition involved "communication with another person" and I was pushing back against that so hard.<<footnote "." "[[here|190302 – Carpe Diem: Chats!]], actually. self-note, sorry!">> I wanted to say that art is still art, even if the artist works for 2 months on a canvas & just hides it in their basement and keeps doing this for years and //never// shows anyone -- that artist's work is still valid, I wanted to shout!

But I think I was wrong.

I pushed back against that definition because I felt afraid of communication and wanting to say things out loud where one or many other people might hear. I felt afraid of even the possibility of having a voice louder than just a private journal page.

> There is only one way I get to know who I faithfully take to be you: you tell me who you are and keep performing with me in our play. That's online or offline.<<footnote "musik" "soundtrack for this letter: [[Stories We Tell Ourselves – Edie Brickell]]">>

hugs, sphygmus<<footnote "pps" "this is still  a draft -- I think? or one in a series of more letters.">><<footnote "." "'a) lots of people more eloquent than me have said these things about self-narrative. b) thank you for listening to me talk about it. c) anxiety spiral brain is triggered so I'm going to end this letter here!">>
