title: 2019.02.05 - Afterschool Teaching: Flu

I showed up first for the first time in a bit. I've been adjusting my schedule since I now see that my prep is completely pointless. I got my work done, setup the snack, and talked with Whitney. The high schoolers sat and listened in the background as we talked about the nature and structure of schools (through university). Sportsball culture is a disease, and even though she loves basketball, she made my argument for me. She even cussed (which is considered inappropriate in this context and highly unlike her). We talked about the differences I see between my own children and the students I have; we discussed what this job is really about.

They never called us, so we were a couple minutes late. That's not a problem. I was handed the older students again, and I think Whitney is enjoying following the process given to her by Mitchell. I let my kids get louder than Matt prefers (or many others). As long as they are working together, I'm not going to maintain absolute silence. There's a difference between respectful indoor voices and whispering. I will happily isolate students who need it. This is afterschool though, and I don't need a dead quiet library (even though that is obviously my radical preference...that is often how we work in our house).

Baines is fair and she gives a shit. She is cordial, freely gives her resources (I am grateful too!), organized, and personal (not merely personable). I have watched her even when she thinks I'm not. Dare I say it? There is a non-trivial chance she's an actual teacher. I am beyond excited to have someone to respect as much as the janitors.

I still have students coming to me for math. Cool. I'm glad to be of use to them. Some listen and some don't, but that's normal too. 

5Hf is sick! I am irrationally protective of my namesake. She is a tiny child and every bit the kind firecracker (into annoyingness). Had her call her mom, just in case. I gave her space to rest in the classroom before the office could hold her. It is exceedingly rare that I touch other humans, but she needed to know I'm there and feel her pain, so I patted her back as I talked to her. 

People are getting sick all over.

Eventually, Matt took my spot. He has been communicating effectively enough with me today (though I suggest he is annoyed with me at times). I went and took Whitney's with the 5th and 6th. 5NP has been well-behaved for me (minus lying to me to impress me...)! WTF is happening? We talked about games and famous Youtubers. I annoy them to no end, I'm too old, etc. Some people like my music, some people don't (to be expected). 

6Df is a well-behaved student. She clearly trusts me. She also wanted me to help her with the talent show. She wants to write music and poetry (she's come to the wrong person; I know as much as Jon Snow). We talked about talent, drafting, approval-seeking, and knowing when you've got something you love.

The computer lab is wonderful. I have a walkie today because of the game. I received the usual inquiries into what I'm doing on my stood-up phone and bluetooth folding keyboard. I am regularly asked how much it costs? Wat.

I blindeye allow the students to use the headphones and robotics equipment. I let them surf whatever. If they have done their work and they aren't disturbing others, I see no reason not to let them play on their phones, chat, listen to music, and explore (I wish I could actively encourage it; I could show 'em how it's done). I, of course, have to explain what the rules are and the repercussions of not following the rules to the children with an unwinking wink. They need not hide from me, but they do need to hide from the pseudo-police in this facility.

Matt decided we would all pay for the kids to have a "celebration" since we can't have anything called a "party." I suppose that means I'm working for free that day. Great.

Janitors are feeling the sickness run through us. One has been hospitalized. Asking about their families too. Teachers and students are dropping like flies; some other schools are said to have 30-40% OUT!
