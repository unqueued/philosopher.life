Wireless work?

Wireless interwebs? Yes. It was the only way I could get the Manjaro download to work. :O

Manjaro should be able to install without wireless, though it is preferred to be connected.

After that, my suggestion is to walk through every piece of software you can find. Just to know where it is, what it does, and you can customize the look and feel.

My suggestion is to have 4 workspaces minimum, and set your hotkeys to navigate them.

I like to use ctrl+alt+[directional-arrow-key] (or something similar)
