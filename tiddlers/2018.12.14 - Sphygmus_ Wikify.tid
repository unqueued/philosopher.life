omg okay this wikify stuff is incredible
FRI 2:12 PM
I don't know what the "wikify" function means.
FRI 2:13 PM
Still scratching my head.
FRI 2:13 PM
It looks amazing from afar, lol.
FRI 2:13 PM
I'm gonna have to revamp my button in light of this
FRI 2:14 PM
phew, delay not intended
FRI 2:23 PM
I'm still not 100% sure what wikify does but I've got to the point where it replicates the functionality of my button's hack for making bulleted libks
FRI 2:24 PM
*links
FRI 2:24 PM
given that this is built in and doesn't require hacking my own JS I'm definitely rewriting the button haha
FRI 2:25 PM
I'm at work, so I'll be akfish. I will respond, ofc. :smiley:
FRI 2:29 PM
I am too! Hence the delay. :sweat_smile: Hope it goes smoothly for you! :)

Wikify may solve several kinds of problems for us.
FRI 2:30 PM
Hm, I may have rejoiced too early - stuck on getting the linebreak with ** in between each link.
FRI 2:36 PM
If nothing else the wikify way works great for creating hard coded bulleted lists for monthly audits
FRI 2:37 PM
ha! Figured out the indented bullet.
FRI 3:01 PM
If you had a space to insert the prompt for the prompted introspection so it auto-inserted when that tiddler was created from the button, would that be useful?
