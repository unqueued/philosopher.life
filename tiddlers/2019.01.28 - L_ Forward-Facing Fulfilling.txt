How's your day going?
THU 12:33 PM
Pretty well actually! I have been having a very good week mentally \o/
THU 12:41 PM
I think watching [[K]] play Kingdom Hearts is the most emotional I’ve ever seen him get over a video game. It’s very cute hehe.
THU 12:42 PM
lol
THU 12:43 PM
I'm glad he's got a story that is emotional for him.
THU 12:44 PM
I'm glad you've been doing well this week too. It sounds like it has been greatly needed.
THU 12:45 PM
It has for sure. It’s been nice!
THU 12:56 PM
How are you all fairing in this stupidly cold weather?
THU 12:56 PM
Working hard. It's us three sitting in a 10" by 10" square in the living room pouring ourselves into learning (and vv.). It's good.

The wiki is the best explanation, as usual. =)

[[k0sh3k]]'s been working. I'm envious that she has a job that she literally hates having days off from.

That's vocation right there.
THU 1:03 PM
That is amazing actually. I wish I could find that too.

I realized today that the most fulfilling part of my job is also the most forward facing. I think that says a lot about me.
THU 1:04 PM
But it’s making me consider different aspects of the “what to do when I grow up” idea I keep mulling around in my head.
THU 1:04 PM
What is forward-facingness here?
