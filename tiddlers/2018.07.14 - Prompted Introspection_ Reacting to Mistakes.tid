title: 2018.07.14 - Prompted Introspection: Reacting to Mistakes

!! How do you react when you realize you've made a mistake?

Depends on the mistake and its context. It ranges from [sometimes I literally don't care] all the way to [sometimes it makes me want to take my life]. It really depends on a number of factors. I have strong elements of psychological perfectionism (which is only partially related to my metaethical perfectionist tendencies), and I have the usual issues which go with it. See [[h0p3's Mental Deviation]] for the gambit. 

I am quite aware of my mistakes and the mistakes of others. As an autist, I am continually surprised by how my models radically lack predictive merit in almost all aspects of my life. It's why I think I'm in survival mode in working on this wiki; it's the only chance I have to model it effectively enough.
