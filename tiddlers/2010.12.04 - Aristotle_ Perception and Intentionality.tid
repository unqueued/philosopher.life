title: 2010.12.04 - Aristotle: Perception and Intentionality

Aristotle never gives a direct account of intentionality.<<ref "1">>  He does, however, provide rich accounts of some foundational topics to intentionality, e.g. the nature of reason and intellection, belief, //phantasia//, and perception.<<ref "2">>  These notions aren’t so straightforward though; they must be understood in context. For example, Aristotle believed in the primacy of ontology (an awkward worldview for many moderns), which was subsequently mirrored by language and epistemology; he carefully constructs these conceptual relationships throughout his work, and they are powerful constraints in a consideration of his theory of intentionality. It is also crucial to understand where and how Aristotle is reacting to various philosophers, especially to Plato, as this illuminates the context of his words. Lastly, the clear differentiationism found in his descriptions of the souls and teleological ends of plants, animals, humans, and God may prove useful in an examination of Aristotle’s intentional outlook, especially to moderns who wish to investigate the intentional similarities and differences between non-human animal and human minds. Combining these various elements, it seems conceivable to ‘piece together’ and sketch out central features of a theory of intentionality which Aristotle might likely have given. 

Of course, generating such an account, however carefully we might try, is fraught with the peril of not living up to the standard of the account of intentionality Aristotle might have actually given himself. As a component of this peril, there exists a danger of overstepping our bounds by eisegetically injecting modern notions of various philosophical thought into Aristotle’s worldview. If we are to offer a charitable account of intentionality which Aristotle himself plausibly might have provided, it must be done in keeping with his worldview. So, in an attempt to hedge myself against committing these offenses, I’m forced to speak both tentatively and conservatively about Aristotle’s account of intentionality. 

Also, in appreciating the both Aristotle’s extensive body of work and the breadth of matters which must be considered in the construction of a systematic theory of intentionality, I realize that the scope of this paper must be narrowed. It is my hope that I can offer a piece of what might count as part of a larger perspective on Aristotle’s account of intentionality. I’m going to focus upon aspects of Aristotle’s theory of perception, particularly as it relates to a more comprehensive theory of intentionality, seeking to comply with, if not further support, his overarching philosophical commitments to essentialism and teleology.

The// De Anima// is the richest source of information concerning Aristotle’s theories of perception. Let’s first briefly cover the conceptual framework of perception, pointing out its place within Aristotle’s teleological agenda, and then we’ll be in a position to examine the mechanical stages of perception with more detail. 

#The basic structure of perception is agent, medium, and patient.

#Perception can only transpire from movement or affection, pointing towards both perception’s similarity to intellection and also the potentiality of its proper objects (accidental sensible qualities).<<ref "3">>

#Only things with souls can possibly perceive, and perception seems to be some sort of qualitative alteration of the patient (that which is perceiving).<<ref "4">>  This is qualified, however, as Aristotle’s distinction between 1st potentiality, 2nd potentiality/1st actuality, and 2nd actuality comes into play in the explanation of the alteration. 

#Sense perception is a shift from 2nd potentiality/1st actuality to 2nd actuality, parallel to the geometer actively employing intellection, which Aristotle explains isn’t a normal sense of alteration (perhaps not even alteration at all, depending on the interpretation).<<ref "5">>

#Perceived objects affect the perceiver in such a way that the perceiver becomes like that which is perceived.<<ref "6">>  

#Perception is a certain sort of causal process (the word ‘cause’ had a much broader meaner for Aristotle) whereby the perceptible object acts upon the patient.

As to the mechanics of perception, all senses have a sense-organ. Eyes are for sight, ears for hearing, etc. The sense-organs are the perceivers, not the animal or human which has the sense organ. To be clear, the organs are the material cause, and the capacity for perception is the form which inheres in the corresponding organ, and thus perception isn’t reducible to merely the matter of organs. 

There are proper objects of perception – namely, color is something you see, and sound is something you hear, etc. In turn, perception of an object is actually perception of certain qualities inhering in the object which corresponds to the sense-organ, e.g. the quality of sweetness inhering in honey is what you taste, but you can’t taste other accidental qualities of the honey which don’t correspond to the sense-organ – you couldn’t taste its weight, for instance. 

As a plenum theorist (denying an incommensurable gulf or void between perceiver and object), Aristotle held that each sense has a medium through which the object or agent being perceived can transmit its form to the sense-organ. For everyday sight, air is the medium, or while underwater, the transparent water is the medium. Worth noting, the exact causal structure of the mediums of perception and how these mediums relate to third parties is a controversial issue; it is, unfortunately, beyond the scope of this paper.

Exactly what occurs when the form reaches the sense-organ is where we begin to see Aristotle’s intentionality unfold.  Here is an example of the process: the blackboard, as an agent, acts upon the patient by transmitting blackness and its various visual features through the air (the air being the medium) to the patient’s corresponding sense-organs, viz. eyes. The patient’s eyes are in turn //hylomorphically //altered, as the form of blackness is enformed in the patient’s eyes, altering his or her eyes to take on the sensible form of blackness which also inheres in the blackboard. The capacity to see, in this case, is the capacity for the patient to take on the form but not the matter of blackboard qua its visual accidental qualities. 

The controversial aspect of this theory of perception is what it means for a sense-organ to become like (in form, but not matter) that which it perceives, particularly given Aristotle’s emphasis on the physiological nature of the sense-organs. The germane passages are unclear:

<<<
As we have said, what has the power of sensation is potentially like what the perceived object is actually; that is, while at the beginning of the process of its being acted upon the two interacting factors are dissimilar, at the end the one acted upon is assimilated to the other and is identical in quality with it.<<ref "7">>
<<<
<<<
Generally, about all perception, we can say that a sense is what has the power of receiving into itself the sensible forms of things without the matter, in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a signet-ring without the iron or gold; what produces the impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but not qua bronze or gold: in a similar way the sense is affected by what is coloured or ﬂavoured or sounding not insofar as each is what it is, but insofar as it is of such and such a sort and according to its form.<<ref "8">>
<<<

The “Likeness” principle makes great use of Aristotle’s understanding of potentiality and actuality (central tenets of his teleological view of the world). In the case of perception, there is a relationship between your potential-based status prior to perceiving the blackboard vs. actually perceiving the blackboard, which Aristotle wishes to highlight. It seems as if both likeness and unlikeness are essential to both perception and intellection, and, again, this makes sense given Aristotle’s painstaking distinction between what is accidental and what is essential to the world. Perception is all about sensing that which is accidental in a particular. The relationship of “Likeness” is found between the accidental qualities of sense or sense-organ (depending on the interpretation) and the corresponding accidental sensible qualities of the perceived object.  Exactly how we should further interpret this “Likeness” remains unclear. There are two major schools of thought.

Richard Sorabji, in his work: //Intentionality and Physiological Processes: Aristotle’s Theory of Sense-Perception//, defends (at great length and with very detailed exegesis) a literalist, physiological explanation of sense perception. Interpreters in this vein construe the process of perception to be a physical change in the eye itself, eventually pointing towards functionalism. This requires a somewhat literal interpretation. Essentially, the sense-organ factually becomes like that which it perceives, usually considered non-representational (though Brentano’s physical theory is considered representational), but in plain likeness and exemplification of the form of the perceptibles inherent to the object being perceived. The nose which smells cinnamon from a bun literally becomes like cinnamon; both the nose and bun share the accidental property of the cinnamon smell.

Of course, the physiological interpretation is problematic to us as moderns. Our scientific understanding of sensation gives us very good reasons to deny many aspects of Aristotle’s scientific views, but does this rule out all physiological interpretations of this passage? Perhaps it is still possible to defend it in light of our empirical knowledge, and perhaps the literal ‘taking on the red’ is still a process in physics, whereby light waves of redness affect the red-sensing cones in our eyes, or something along those lines. Oddly enough, the modern scientific understanding of retinotopic maps for visual perception is strikingly comparable to the physiological interpretation. 

One standing problem remains: I don’t understand how the literalist account of perception isn’t going to actually be a normal sort of alteration or affection, the taking on and shedding of accidental properties, which seems to contradict Aristotle’s potentiality/actuality qualifications given to both perception and intellection.

The other major interpretation of this ‘Likeness’ issue is the cognitive argument. In this case, the sense is really an awareness of what is perceived. This interpretation relies upon a stronger distinction between the actual sense and the sense-organ, emphasizing the awareness of the sense rather than the physical nature of the organ. M.F. Burnyeat’s paper, //Is an Aristotelian Philosophy of Mind Still Credible?//, which is in part a response to Sorabji’s work, is famous for this cognitive argument.
 
Burnyeat’s interpretation is that there isn’t a major physiological change, only a cognitive one. Now, he isn’t talking about the mind’s ability to think about what we’ve perceived (an important epistemic point in Aristotle that both the physiological and cognitive theories can maintain); rather, he’s talking about //awareness //of the actual sense which inheres in the sense-organs as taking on the ‘Likeness’ of the form of the object perceived (without its matter). Interestingly, in some manner, the awareness of perception is found in the sense-organ itself (not what you might expect). The cognitive argument emphasizes awareness, which I can appreciate because Aristotle himself indicates that perception is pregnant with awareness. The cognitivist is making the claim that it is the awareness of the sense-organ which takes on the ‘Likeness’ of the perceptible object (which is more metaphorical and abstract than the physiological argument). The cognitive argument makes strong use of symbolic representation in a way that the physiological account does not.

It is unclear what it means, although intuitively satisfactory, for perception to have awareness, and it is even further complicated by the notion (which is not intuitively satisfactory) that this awareness resides, in some manner, in sense-organs. Further, problematic to the cognitive interpretation is that it fails to account for Aristotle’s fixation and emphasis upon the physiological aspects of sensation. Why exactly would Aristotle spend so much time explaining the physical process only to then not have used it in his argument about taking on the form of the perceptible object?

It seems plausible to me that we can interpret this ‘Likeness’ issue using both the physiological and the cognitive theories. They aren’t entirely mutually exclusive. I think a hybrid theory might solve some of the problems of each of the individual theories. It seems plausible as an interpretation because it follows the physiological process which Aristotle emphasized, and the cognitive awareness component can make sense of Aristotle’s alteration qualification, such that perception is some sort of ‘abnormal’ alteration parallel to intellection. I rather like how the hylomorphic aspects of perception can be handled and understood by such a hybrid. Essentially, perception’s material aspect is explained through the physiological, and in a manner there is ‘Likeness’, and perception’s formal aspect (further taking on the form but not the matter) is explained through cognitive awareness of an object’s corresponding sensibles. It seems plausible that we should interpret Aristotle as claiming that perception of an external object’s sensible properties is a conversion from a physiological process to a cognitive one.

Perception is also conceptually parallel to Aristotle’s notion of intellection. Sense perception and intellection are both object-oriented because one can’t understand the epistemic without making reference to the ontic world. The major difference is that the objects of intellection are in some manner internal to the mind (the form is an object in the mind, although the form must reference the ontic world), while the objects of perception are considered external (relying upon accidental particulars). Fundamental to Aristotle’s teleology (and the difference in purpose of these two capacities) is that perception is of particulars and intellection is of universals. Structurally, perception and intellection are the same; it is only the scope of their proper objects which are different. The relationship between perception and reason is more than that of teleological analogs, however, for they are actually directly linked in Aristotle’s philosophy of mind. Perception precedes and feeds intellection.

Plato’s refutation of certain accounts of knowledge and intellection in the Theaetetus heavily influenced Aristotle’s //De Anima//, particularly with respect to perception. Aristotle claims that the sense is never wrong about the special objects of perception, and he derives this from Plato.<<ref "9">>  Plato denies ‘being’ in the predicative mode (‘X is Y’, which is separate from the existential mode ‘X exists’ or the veridical mode ‘X is true’) to the five senses. Because the senses cannot be wrong, they can never formulate a proposition. For example, as one can’t be wrong about perceiving color, Plato thinks one can’t state a proposition about the color. As soon as one can formulate a proposition, truth and falsity come into play. If one says ‘the moon is flat’, one is making a proposition, which is subject to truth values. Truth is not applicable to the senses, for Plato. Sense perception, for him, cannot be knowledge. Knowledge does not occur at the level of the senses, only at a higher level. 

Aristotle is responding to Plato’s view. Aristotle agrees with Plato as to the inerrancy of perception with respect to their proper objects, such that one can’t be wrong about taking on the sensible form in perception. The patient can’t be wrong about the fact that agent acts upon him or her because the patient is ‘aware’ that he or she has been affected. Aristotle, however, claims that while one isn’t wrong about perceiving an actual object, one can be wrong about the judgments one makes from that perception. Aristotle thinks that knowledge is strongly connected to perception in a manner that Plato doesn’t (in this way, we see elements of ‘loose empiricism’ in Aristotle’s account). The major counterexample Aristotle introduces against Plato’s view are the ‘common sensibles’, which are accessible to more than one sense in any particular instance. Aristotle considers these to be a proverbial ‘monkey-wrench thrown into’ Plato’s theory of perception.

Aristotle believes he can handle the common sensibles where Plato can’t, and this is accomplished through the development of ‘common sense’ (making intelligible the common sensibles), which is the focal point of consciousness where the senses meet and are unified.<<ref "10">>  Aristotle thought that Plato’s view of perception using the five senses perceiving a single common sensible led to the generation of five selves, which further led to unintelligibility of the world and self. Crucially, for Aristotle, it seems there is perhaps only a conceptual distinction between the senses and perhaps not an actual one.<<ref "11">>  They are actually unified, and they also have a unifying concept. Common sense is over and above the five senses, and, namely, it is the awareness that you are sensing the same thing with your different senses. The unification of the common sense enables Aristotle to deny that you have two or more senses for the same object (also denying that there are two or more selves). He treats the senses as having the same structure, as if they all adhere to the same conceptual apparatus. Unfortunately, Aristotle is not so clear about the ‘common sense’-organ. In the //De Anima//, he suggests there isn’t one. The ‘common sense’ is closer than the five senses to capacity for intellection, and so, perhaps like the fact that the intellect has no organ (according to Aristotle), the common sense might not as well.

The five senses give us the data, the common sense unifies the data. Each of the five senses is incapable of falsehood. And, while at the level of the five senses, propositional judgments are not formulated; propositional judgments must be made by the common sense. For example, I judge that the object I am seeing is also the object I am touching.

As perception is related to intellection directly, the intellect can’t think of perceptibles insofar as they aren’t intelligible. And, insofar as perceptibles aren’t intelligible, namely their accidental qualities rather than the essential ones, the capacity for perception is doing the conceptual heavy-lifting. Particulars are intelligible and understandable insofar as they participate in the forms, and the forms are the domain of the intellect, not perception. Concept formation within the intellect, however, relies upon input from perception. Unlike the intellect, there is no hierarchy of lesser or higher perceptibles as there is for intelligible; rather, the senses have equal epistemological status amongst each other, as do the sensibles amongst themselves.<<ref "12">> 

There is another topic of intentional interest which can be derived from Aristotle’s theory of perception – namely, Aristotle’s view on the intentional states of non-human animals vs. humans. Aristotle is clearly a differentiationist as set out by his very distinct teleological ends of animals and of humans; humans, unlike animals, have the power of intellection and essentially partake in the activity of Aristotle’s God. In Aristotle’s pyramid of souls, the vegetative and reproductive capacities are found in all forms of life (other than God’s, but he is a very special exception in the teleological framework); what distinguishes animals and the higher beings from mere plants are the capacities of motion, perception and memory (not all animals are said to possess memory, though; only some). While animals and humans are clearly differentiated by the possession (or lack) of reason, they both have perception in common, and perhaps both could be said to have intentionality (although most likely in differing degrees).

 Unlike his teacher, Aristotle denies that animals have beliefs. Aristotle thinks that beliefs are connected with reason (in a manner unlike Plato), and so to those animals he denies reason, he also denies beliefs.<<ref "13">>  Interestingly, as Aristotle diminishes the role of belief in animals, in order to make sense of the dynamic activity that animals do demonstrate (which the capacity for ‘belief’ handled for Plato, but cannot for Aristotle), he realizes he is forced to give a much more expansive account of perception (than any other philosopher had at the time) to make up for animals lacking the capacity for belief. The result is interesting because it recognizes some kinds of predication and judgment on behalf of the non-human animal kingdom. For example, a dog can perceive a scent. He perceives more than just the scent, though; he may also be able to perceive the direction from which that scent came. Since the dog lacks reason and belief, according to Aristotle, then the machinery of perception is doing the heavy inferential and predicative lifting. The direction is predicated of the scent, and this sort of predication is contained within the dog’s perception.

Aristotle’s emphasis on perception and his expansion of the definition of its capacity imparts several intentional features to its possessors. Animals benefit from this, and it seems that Aristotle’s teleology goes a long way towards establishing the similarities (and not just the differences) between humans and non-human animals.
 
Despite Aristotle’s careful construction of his account of perception and its relation to intellection, there are serious limitations to the realms of these related faculties from the perspective of more modern notions of intentionality. Unfortunately, neither of Aristotle’s theories of intellection and perception are meant to handle or make sense of some important modern intentional concerns, e.g. dreams, imagination, future hopes, hallucinations, spiritual experience and faith. It is likely that phantasia, a capacity connected to perception and experience, is the device which handles many intentional concerns which perception and intellection cannot explain.

There are many unsolved portions of this puzzle, but this should serve as a good sketch of his theory of perception and its relation to intentionality. Unfortunately, Aristotle’s theory of perception is far from sufficient for an adequate theory of intentionality, but I think it is a necessary component to his theory of intentionality.
