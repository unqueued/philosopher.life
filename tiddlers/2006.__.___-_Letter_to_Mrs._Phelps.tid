title: 2006.??.?? - Letter to Mrs. Phelps

//Not posted on Hypercynic, but it was a significant letter I wrote around the same time.//

Dear Mrs. Phelps,
 

I apologize for any silence or lack of communication on my part. I am a very (very) vocal person within the proper context or group of people. In most cases, over the past year, the verbalization of my opinion would not have resulted in anything truly useful. In cases that I don’t know exactly what I ‘ought to do’ I prefer to follow some principles of Utility. Hence, my lack of communication overall—for any seeming rudeness I apologize. I meant no harm. Now that I am finished teaching at JHHS, and moving on to other things, I feel it is appropriate and useful to “open up”, so to speak, and express my true opinions. I questioned whether I would actually give this letter to you at all. I have considered the possibility that you may dismiss my thoughts, and perhaps passionate opinions, as childish rhetoric or the expression of some inexperienced and ungrateful colleague. I believe, however, as you are truly a kind and wonderful person, you will be objective and charitable as you read this letter. Please excuse my casual and fragmented writing style, as I hope the way in which my ideas are expressed will not take away from the validity of the statements.
 

I have accomplished so much in such a short time. Last year I was single, childless, and without a college diploma—now I am somehow concerned with money, housing, marriage, children, insurance, and all of the wonderful responsibilities of adulthood. Part of my ‘Rite of Passage’ into adulthood has been holding a real job. Teaching English is a real job. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to teach high school English over the past year. You have guided me through a testing and time consuming educational experience.
 

I am happy with most things in my life, with the exception of my job as a teacher at John Hardin High school. There are a number of reasons that I have not been happy about this component of my life. I wish to explore these reasons, partly because it is important for me to understand what has occurred, in some therapeutic sense, and in part because you have a right to know. The year did not go as smoothly as I had hoped. A number of barriers and problems arose that have caused me to realize that I am not meant to teach here, or in the public school setting at all. I feel, at the very least, as you provided me the opportunity to teach in the first place, I owe you a proper explanation of my reasons for not pursuing a career in teaching high school English.
 

You once phrased my experience as being “baptized by fire.” That statement is so very true. Everyday I came to work, I felt as if I were in a hellish war zone. Teaching is difficult, especially when you’ve never taught a population like John Hardin’s before. No matter how much meta-teaching one might receive in a college class, I believe people are never truly prepared to teach in the actual classroom (I know I certainly wasn’t prepared). Ironically, nothing we teach can completely prepare these kids for the real world either. Even lacking preparation, I do not regret the journey or the job. I have lived and learned, and I am pleased and greatly honored to have taught at this institution. Regardless of my conclusions about teaching here at John Hardin, I want you to know that you have my deepest appreciation and respect—you have given me an opportunity that few will ever have. This year has been life-defining and is sure to set the course of my life. Thank you for being a friend, a mentor, and an investor in my future. 
 

I love both learning and teaching. I am called to these professions, specifically teaching, as a vocation and a purpose. Teaching is more than a job or a lifestyle; teaching is my calling. To whom much is given much is required. God has blessed me with an unmatched mind, I must, therefore, use what God has given me to help others by distributing knowledge and thought. I am designed to teach others to think. You would expect JHHS to be a proper location to fulfill my purpose. So, why would I choose to not teach at JHHS?


The purpose of a school is to learn, teach, acquire knowledge, and think. Unfortunately, I find here at John Hardin, and probably in public schooling in its entirety, people are not usually concerned with actual learning and teaching. There are exceptions to my basic generalization, but overall, as a relatively objective outsider, I have found this to be true in most all cases. Don’t get me wrong, learning does occur. But, is that learning concerned with the correct topics and concepts? Is it substantial and sufficiently thought provoking enough to create lifelong learners? --Clearly not. We may, therefore, conclude that John Hardin is not acting as a school in the truest sense of the term—we have not fulfilled our purpose to the fullest extent. 
 

Why haven’t we? Is it the fault of the teachers? To some extent maybe, but for the most part I would say, No. Who is, in the end, responsible for the failures of public schooling? The parents and students themselves of course! There are two significant reasons why schools are failing. Public schooling fails because of a political climate that removes self-responsibility, and it also fails because people, in general, are becoming relativists lacking the desire to seek truth.


School wasn’t always like it is today. In the past, parents and students were held responsible, and were, in general, more concerned with academic progress than the parents and students of today. Why the change in our parents? Here is a tip to understand people: Modern parents and students are dim-witted—they are cogs to be controlled. This doesn’t mean they aren’t actually responsible for their actions, but rather, they are easily distracted and manipulated. Who distracts and manipulates them, and why?
 

Politicians and power-hungry pseudo-teacher careerist administrators are at the very core of the public schools political problem. People want power; power is acquired and maintained via a content public. School administrators and especially politicians will say and do anything to get the vote. The struggle for power of these governmental and educational politicians lead to the public declaration of two principles: 1) The school is solely responsible for the beliefs and behaviors of children, while neither the children themselves nor their parents are responsible for their own beliefs and behaviors, and 2) all children are ‘academically’ equal. These are very dangerous and disturbing ideas. Of course, these ideas are easily spread because they are popular—they relieve the moral burden of a parent, while leaving a ‘way out’ for students. Parents, and society in general, simply do not want to take responsibility for their actions and the actions of their children. A politician can easily soothe the ears and minds of parents with the idea that someone else is actually responsible for the failings of these children. If Johnny is failing English, it must be the school’s  (or teacher’s) fault. Parents want to believe they did what was best for their child, and are easily led to the conclusion that anything that goes wrong must not have been their responsibility, but instead must be due to the menace of chance or the villains we find teaching in the public school system. We as teachers know better. But, most people do not understand this large socio-political problem. Essentially, people are afraid of the truth; People want lies. Politicians are more than willing to give them lies to gain political support (power). Those ideas changed the social and parenting landscape—now, parents want answers from the school system as to why their children are smoking dope, failing classes, increasingly suicidal, rebellious, disrespectful, amoral, and prone to screw up. Parents really believe that it is the fault of the school system and not the fault of themselves and their children.
 

People are cogs in a system. Even given their free will, they naturally gravitate towards their conditioning. The attitudes and behaviors of parents and students cannot and will not change without the proper social conditioning. This conditioning can only occur, ironically, through those who lead and teach them how they ought to think and how they should behave—a duty of a parent. So, yes, they are in the end responsible for their actions. However, I do not see their beliefs and behaviors changing without a shift in our current political climate. Primarily, we require a transformation in that echo chamber which disseminates the ideas of social irresponsibility—we must prevent any incentive for this chamber of politicians to blame the school system instead of the voter. In my opinion, that isn’t going to happen. As a result, the same hogwash will be embedded in the minds of the general public, parents and students, preventing the public school system from holding these parties responsible for their own actions. Without holding parents and students responsible, what incentive do they have to put forth the effort and to maintain the discipline required to learn and grow? 


The second reason public schooling, and even the public in general, is on the brink of destruction is the philosophical evolution from reason to irrationalism, from to truth to “truthiness,” from reality to relativism. We, as a Western culture, have lost sight of the concept of truth. You may have heard something like: “what is true for you may not be true for me” (I got this from students analyzing poetry all the time). Or maybe you’ve heard, “what is right for you is right for you, what is right for me is right for me.” This sort of thinking smacks of post-modern relativism. It is the view that the meaning and value of human beliefs and behaviors have no absolute reference, and especially that moral or ethical propositions do not reflect absolute and universal moral truths—instead all “truths” are relative to social, cultural, historical, or personal references, and there is no single standard by which to assess any proposition of truth. When we think through relativism to its fullest extent (ironic to say the least), we arrive at a number of conclusions, including:


# A blatant contradiction in meaning and significance such that it is impossible to discuss anything as it is “all relative” to one’s perspective. Apparent truths, even axiomatic ones, like 2+2=4, have no meaning, and can be whimsically denied through the relativistic idea that reality is what we perceive it to be.
# Amorality, and consequently, that it is meaningless for the moral or ethical judgments or acts of one person or group to be judged by another since there most likely aren’t universal moral standards in the first place.
# Personal responsibility is an illusion created through some form of social Darwinism.
#  Egoism, or maybe even narcissistic egotism, claiming that an individual should pursue their own interests with zero regard for the interests or rights of others.
# And, connected to Egoism, yet still distinctively different, Hedonism—the complete lack of concern for anything but one’s own happiness (often short-sighted as well).


How do you teach truth to people who don’t believe in absolute truths? How do you instill morals into those who believe ethics and morality are illusions? You can’t reason with a true Romantic, and you sure as hell can’t reason with a post-modern relativist. Society has generated a group of idiots…a lot of them. What then should we as people (specifically teachers in this case) do? Since politicians will be politicians, and the content of the conditioning will not change, we must then: Let the system fail, and be ready to pick up the pieces! Only when crack addicts hit absolute rock bottom will they choose to rebuild their lives. Let the post-modern world hit rock bottom, and be there to equip them when they are ready to change. Our job, as educated and intelligent teachers, is to do exactly that—to let the public feel the complete consequences of their actions, and then help rebuild and restart. If we expect them to be responsible for their actions, then let them be responsible---let them have what is coming to them. This doesn’t mean innocent students who are respectful, moral, and hard working will be hurt. If anything they will benefit as the superstars of their generation. They will be the survivors in the game of  ‘survival of the fittest.’


So, after reaching these conclusions, I must also defend the premises. Most importantly, I need to show that the school is failing in the first place. I have worked inductively, and I apologize for that. An explanation and some elaboration are certainly in order. The evidence of a social and/or educational breakdown is lacking. As previously asked, ‘why would I choose not to teach at JHHS?’
 

Offered are a few glimpses of my experiences at JHHS that may help answer that question. Hopefully, these examples will show some of the reasoning behind my distress. With the knowledge of what has occurred, and why it occurred, we will be in a better position to understand my choices concerning my future career(s). Provided, in no particular order, are a few encounters and basic overviews of the past year that support my claims against parents, pupils, and politicians.


#      Sports are more important to this school than academics. 
##      Football players are given precedence and special treatment, to the point that administrators will call me during class to “do whatever it takes for Johnny to be in the game tonight.” Where is their concern for the other students in my class? 
##     Our basketball team attends the sweet sixteen (not the actual state championship), and JHHS is let out of school. The very same week our academic team went to the state finals, and JHHS wasn’t let out of school—we barely even heard announcements concerning the academic team. We don’t have “pep rallies” for the academic team or for academically successful students.
##      Coaches are hired for their ability to win games, not their ability to teach in the classroom. Coaches are also the first to receive administrative positions.
##     A ridiculous amount of money and effort is put towards our sports teams, while many teachers don’t even have enough books for each student.
 

There are three arguments that would give us reason to allow sports in our school. The first would be the physical fitness acquired through sports, the second would be the entertainment provided by sporting events, and finally, sports can be used as a means to socialize children. We have physical education to cover the first. Entertainment can be found elsewhere. The last reason, dealing with the process of socialization and mental development of children, seems like the best reason.
 

School is a place to develop a number of social skills, including many learned through sports. These social skills, however, can be learned through avenues other than sports. Therefore, as there are many options to socializing these children, sports are not truly necessary to the development of a child. We have no vital reason to uphold sports as much as we do. School is clearly a place of learning though—academics, rather than sports, should be the priority of school. 
 

#      Tests scores are the greatest concern of the school.
##      We were forced to use multiple-choice and open response tests simply to prepare our students for testing. There was no concern for the validity or effectiveness of this testing method. High-test scores were the only concern.
##     Curriculum mapping is based on preparing students for the test. The curriculum is not concerned with teaching kids to learn and think, but instead to make sure the content is fresh in their minds, so as to help them regurgitate information for high-test scores. In the creation, organization, and execution of the curriculum, cramming content knowledge is more important than making sure the students are thinking.
##     I have been commanded on numerous occasions to “Teach the test.” The commander is not actually concerned for the academic welfare of the student, but concerned with high-test scores and not getting into trouble.
## In order to “teach the test,” traditionally relevant curriculum and activities have been thrown away. For example: English classes no longer read “The Scarlet Letter,” instead they watch the movie.
## As a relevant side note, many schools base their teacher salaries on the teacher’s ability to get high scores on tests.
 

In my eyes, “Teaching the test” is one of the more disgusting educational practices. Even teachers themselves uphold this practice! Why? There are only three explanations: 1) the teacher/administrator actually believes these tests are effective in assessing a student’s academic abilities, 2) the teacher/administrator believes that test scores affect school finances, and, he or she attempts to raise them as high as possible, and/or 3) the teacher/administrator does what he or she is told, and “teaches the test” so as to not get into trouble. The last two reasons are clearly immoral and irrelevant to the question: “what is best for the student?” The first reason, if based on true claims, would seem acceptable. 
 

Are these standardized tests actually effective in assessing a student’s academic abilities? No. Multiple choice questions and open response questions only test a student’s ability to follow certain test-taking rules and regurgitate content knowledge. No good assessment of writing or thinking skills can be found in these tests. 
 

The fact is: nobody actually cares if you can recite the characteristics of Puritanism, or regurgitate examples of Romantic literature, or explain the basic outline of a short story, when you don’t have the ability to think and to apply what you have learned in some meaningful way. Content knowledge is pointless outside of the ability to use it and think about it. The public school system, possibly due to political limitations, has forgotten this fact, and instead has opted for a incredibly awful method of assessment. If I can instill in my students the ability (and the desire) to think, then I know they will do fine in life. Memorizing and regurgitating content knowledge, traditionally found only in grammar school, is easy if you possess the ability to think. 
 

“Teaching the test” is an awful practice. We should be ashamed. How dare we create a generation of kids that view schooling and education as a series of hoops to jump through, rather than a creative and fantastic world of learning? I am not going to live a lie, and think that I am really teaching kids the important aspects of education, primarily the ability and desire to think and reason, when I am cornered, commanded, and forced to falsely teach in a manner that is designed to merely raise test scores.


# Teachers are blamed for the failures of students, while parents and the students themselves are not held accountable for each student’s academic performance, behavior, and attitude.
## When looking at demographics and statistics concerning the academic performance of students, especially of students with low test scores, it is assumed that we as a teacher have failed to reach a certain segment of the population of JHHS. We refuse to accept that it could be the community, family, or culture the child lives within that conditions the child to perform so poorly. We relieve the burden of academic responsibility from the student--as if we as teachers form the primary reason that he or she is failing.
## When a student fails a class, a parent is encouraged, via the allowance of such behavior and the incentive of a higher grade for their child, to call the teacher and complain about his or her child's grade. Teachers are almost forced to respond to complaints by giving the students grades they don't deserve. Bonus and makeup work are already expected, and undue leeway and special treatment are becoming expected. 
## Parents and students actually get away with cussing out a teacher. 
## Students are given far too many chances to commit obscene and disrespectful acts, over and over, until they are finally removed from the school.
## Due to a poor disciplinary system from the top down, and our mysterious attempts to remain politically correct, if a student does something wrong, or is in the habit of doing something wrong, we hold that the child has been conditioned into such behavior, and that somehow, because the child was conditioned in this way, the child is not responsible for his or her actions. Therefore, it becomes the teacher’s responsibility to accept this conditioning, lacking any true objective and impartial judgment, and continue teaching while a student is disruptive.
## Teachers are blamed for not using diverse enough teaching methods. Example: not using enough hands-on, group-work, or technology in the classroom.


While I recognize that some people shouldn’t be teachers, either through their misbehavior or lack of qualifications, I believe most teachers do the best with what they have been given, and do actually deserve their position as teacher. The fact remains that teachers are wrongly held responsible for the failures of students in both the academic and social realms. No matter what he or she does, the public school teacher is someone who simply can’t win.


I am appalled by the social allowances made in this school. Regardless of the household they are raised in, people are responsible for their actions. If a child is loud and obnoxious, even if they are raised in a household or culture where this is acceptable, I should not have to put up with their misbehavior. Let the child bear the rod, and believe me, they will learn not to be loud and obnoxious.


Academically, a teacher cannot force a student to learn. If a child chooses not to learn, then guess what, that child isn’t going to learn. I should not have to motivate children—the child themselves or their parents should be the motivating force. Teachers are expected to be supreme motivators, while; ironically, they lack any real power or control to hold a child responsible for his or her actions.


If a child of a powerful parent has a bad grade, I am pressured to pass or raise the score of that child, even if they do not deserve the grade. The only incentive I have to fail a child is the fact that they don’t deserve it. Failing a child means complaints from all ends, paperwork, phone calls, and stress. Once mommy or daddy complains, the game is over, and I am almost forced to just hand over a grade—whether it be through late work or bonus work, I am expected to cut a deal with these kids. Nobody could possibly believe that we should just fail the child.


Keeping up with a child’s academic performance is not a teacher’s responsibility. It is the responsibility of the parent. I shouldn’t be forced to “save-my-butt” every time a child is too lazy or incompetent to successfully navigate my class by writing and calling home every week.


As for teaching methods: Whatever happened to the good old Socratic method? That method seemed to work. I find that many modern teaching and learning methods are not very useful as they miss the entire basis of education in the first place. Knowledge is abstract, period. Thus, people who are proficient with abstract ideas will, generally, be better learners and thinkers; while those who are not talented with the ‘abstract’ will, generally, be poor learners and thinkers. The fact is: if you are attempting to teach an abstract subject, then students must use the parts of their brain to learn those abstract truths. So, yes, school discriminates against those who are not a specific type of learner. And? Hasn’t this been the case for thousands of years? I see no reason to cater to people who will never be good learners. Give them what they need, and move on. They weren’t meant to be in school for an extended period of time—the world needs janitors and fast-food workers, and that segment of the population can fulfill that purpose.


In the end, a student’s behavioral problem is not my problem. I am here to teach and instruct—to distribute knowledge! I am not here to socially condition students, nor to teach them how to behave. These are the responsibilities of a parent, not a teacher.
 

# It is widely accepted that all children are academically equal (or at least equal in potential).
## Smart kids are punished with more work, while “academically disinclined” kids are simply passed through the grade levels.
## The academic performance levels of students in my classes varied to extreme degrees. I often had classes where I had college level students who are forced into the same classroom as students who could barely read.
## I was forced to teach to the mid-level students in the class so that I didn’t go so quickly that academically disinclined kids didn’t understand the material at all, and so slowly that I bored my smart kids completely to death. In the end, I really did go too fast for academically disinclined kids, and too slowly for smart kids—I had no way to help those children reach their potential.
## We expect all students to reach a certain level of proficiency in areas that are often not directly pertinent to the majority of our students will need in the future. 


The belief that all children are academically equal, or at least equal in potential, is absolute madness. All children, academically speaking, are not equal. Some kids will never be capable of completing Calculus or reading Beowulf. Some kids, even at young ages, would be bored of completing Calculus or reading Beowulf, as they would find these to be too easy. As we have so many students with “equal potential,” we are forced to create an environment that is not conducive to growth for those who are above or below the academic capabilities of the mid-level student.


This system is unfair to those who aren’t mediocre. Students that need help will never receive it because I don’t have the time in class to cover each and every point three times over. Students that are extremely intelligent are bored out of their skulls because I have to go at a slower pace for the rest of the students. 


Did you know that students on the lowest end of the learning curve of Kentucky schools are not referred to as special education kids, or identified as a student that needs tutoring or extra help, until they are at the very least FOUR years behind the grade level they should be at? I’m sure that a student that never learned to read by age 12 is somehow actually going to be emotionally ready to learn to read after social pressures have collapsed whatever hint of self-confidence the child may have possessed in the beginning…yeah right!? There is no hope for those kids inside the public school system. 


Students on the highest end of the learning curve are punished for being intelligent—we as teachers are supposed to “modify” the curriculum and simply hand these kids more work to do than the average student. I refuse to give smart kids more work to do for no reason. If anything, we should at least ‘magnet’ those children together, and let them excel elsewhere. We keep them around because they give us some glimmer of hope for the world and the next generation. 


# Remaining politically correct is so awfully important to the school system. This subversive sensitivity isn’t even used to provide equality among students, but instead, to prevent law suits.
## Giving actual statistical evidence of a claim having anything to do with race, ethnicity, gender, or any background is automatically suspect in the eyes of administrators.
## Discussing issues concerning minorities is discouraged, as if students must simply swallow the opinions of the school without thinking for themselves.
## Controversial issues or statements cannot be evaluated or used because it could “offend someone.” Even if these concepts are the very ideas that our students will approach in their daily lives.


Political correctness is a creation of relativism. You are what you eat, what can I say—even teachers and administrators are brainwashed. Sometimes the truth is offensive (no matter how you phrase it). Tough luck! Truth is truth, and if you are offended by it, then I am offended that you are offended by what I said, and then you’ll be offended by me being offended, ad nauseam/infinitum. To be PC is already absurd to some extent; to be PC because you could get a lawsuit is just pitiful.


Just because an issue is emotional or politically charged doesn’t mean we shouldn’t approach the issue. If anything, those are the issues we should be approaching, as they are currently relevant. It is a good place to start setting an example of when, where, why, and how we as citizens of humanity should be thinking about and pursuing these types of controversial issues.


6) Some teachers and many administrators have become careerists, lacking the moral fiber to do what is right, while adhering to any actions that may boost their professional appearance.


I will go no further in my examples on this subject. I am disgusted enough as it is. Naming names will do no good, and could only hurt an already difficult situation. My experience on this playing field is real. Believe me, I’ve seen far too many cases of backstabbing, gossiping, and flat out sabotage. It has been my experience that these people are socially dangerous. I do not have the means, nor the will to use their vile political tactics against them to defeat them. Too many administrators are willing to give up actual thinking and education for metateaching, test scores, and the ease of simply giving in to the will of the parents or student.



Personally, I have felt discriminated against in two ways (not by you of course).


1) I am discriminated against because of my age.


You told me from the beginning this would be the case. I was an idealist enough to believe it may not be true. I was stupid.


I know I am young, new to teaching, and bound to make some mistakes. But, surely all teachers were clearly, at some point, ‘new to teaching’ and ‘bound to make some mistakes.’ Not all teachers are young when they start. But, age shouldn’t make a difference. It, unfortunately, does make a difference—and maybe that has to do with the mindset of employers in general. But, it wasn’t just the employers; it was also from a few of my fellow faculty members. I really got the feeling from a number of teachers (and even overheard a few) that someone my age should never be teaching, especially not in a high school setting.


While being evaluated, I found that, because of my age, I was critiqued quite harshly compared to how someone older would have been critiqued.


I have been chastised for following directions on the specific occasions that teachers were asked to wear a specific type of dress and color. Apparently, I looked too young. You may have noticed that, excluding six days, I wore a tie and dress pants every day. It isn’t like I was attempting to make a fashion statement—I was obeying directions in the first place. What other teachers were pulled aside because they wore a red t-shirt for spirit week, as they were asked to do in the first place, as if they had committed some obscenely unprofessional act? I call it self-righteous hypocrisy. 


In all honestly, I feel I have damn well earned my position. Maybe I don’t have a master’s degree. Maybe I don’t have ten years of English teaching experience. But what do those things have to do with actual successful teaching? Many of people I see here are “educated” and “experienced,” but clearly lack the very critical thinking skills they are supposed to be teaching. 


2) A past childhood action has been held against me.


You may have found out already, as the rampant gossip in this place would not surprise me: As a “bored and brilliant” 14-year old kid I took the initiative to become fluent in computer science, and inevitably arrived at the stupid conclusion that I should use this skill to break through a number of computer security features on my high school network. Yes, I screwed up. I am not proud of my behavior, and it certainly had a huge impact on my life. I have learned a lot since then. It was one third of my lifetime ago. Because of my actions I have had to grow up quickly; and, I think I’ve been relatively successful.


A number of current JHHS teachers were present at my old high school during the incident. They and a few administrators have held this past action against me. In fact, I have been approached directly on this issue a few times, as if I would do the same thing at this age. It is humiliating and completely ridiculous that my record as a minor should be brought against me today. How would those select teachers and administrator’s feel if I brought everything they did as a child against them today, as if they still had a disposition towards such activities?


The fact is: if people are truly concerned with learning and teaching, then they will pursue it. In general, I fail to see this institution’s wholehearted pursuit of truth and knowledge.
 

Public schooling has become, both internally and externally, a political scene. Teaching and pursuing truth and knowledge in this establishment is like casting pearls before swine.
 

After ranting for ten pages, I would like to show some positive perspectives of my experience.


What did I do during the year?


My job, at least in my opinion, was simply to teach English. English is used to communicate an amalgamation of topics and subjects—if it can be written, basically any type of knowledge, then is a part of English as a whole. With that in mind, English teachers of course have a monumental task. As we clearly cannot cover all of English, we are forced to choose the most significant parts—I believe that a classic approach to English covers most of the truly significant facets. Classical English classes taught reading, writing, logic, literary appreciation, grammar (rote memorization), semantics, rhetoric, and even history. I think the classical approach has been quite effective—it should be emulated. Even though classical English can narrow down the priorities to a small set of significant topics, we as public school teachers remain completely overwhelmed and daunted by the task of teaching even these few and particular skills and concepts. Despite the fact that these are important English concerns, and being that we only have so many resources and so much time to teach, we, as public school teachers, are forced to further divvy up and prioritize their significance. It is no longer a question of what we will choose to not teach, but rather what few things we must teach at the sacrifice of everything else? We are forced to give a bare-bones education to the children. Economizing the subjects we teach is not easy, and so, I do admit that I understand some of the curriculum mistakes English teachers have made. When I had to choose what was going to be covered I kept thinking about what skills were necessary for both practical living and essential to the makeup of one with the potential to continue to grow academically. I decided early on that I wanted to create kids who have both the ability and desire to read, think, and write—period. I didn’t care if they scored well on tests, followed the school’s curriculum map, pleased their parents, pleased me, or pleased the people around them. That doesn’t mean they didn’t score well, or follow the curriculum map, or please anyone—but these were not my goals. So how did I think I could arrive at a classroom of students who could effectively read, think, and write?


While I respect the fact that people cannot learn and truly think without having a few regurgitatable facts to rub between their fingers, content knowledge is severely lacking when compared to the utility and imperative natures of critical thinking and communication skills. Basically, the primary objective of a modern public school English teacher is to get a student to read, think, and then to communicate those thoughts. These primary objectives, of course, include basic grammar, reading techniques, and essay forms. In my class we didn’t just cover “how-to” do these; we also endlessly practiced them over and over again. Secondary objectives include teaching content knowledge, appreciation of historical time period and literature, and the finer points of communication, including some forms of semantics and rhetoric. Even if academics require the secondary skills, I would argue that most people do not need to know such things to continue with their daily lives. While I don’t expect every student to be fluent and skilled in the secondary objectives of English, I do expect every student to be extremely familiar and competent in fulfilling the primary objective of English. I concentrated on the primary objectives. We read everything in the curriculum (because we had to cover it) and more. We thought about and discussed everything we read. We wrote on everything we read. Practice, practice, and more practice—I simply can’t expect good reading, thinking, and writing, if we don’t do it every single day.


Our students lack the ability to effectively read, think, and write. I wanted to change that failure above all others. I asked my students to read, think, and write—we did this every single day in all of my classes (even if it was boring and difficult). No matter where these kids were in their education, they would always be challenged, and, in my opinion, they were significantly challenged in the right areas. 


Was I effective? To some extent, yes. Although the majority of my students never reached proficiency in any of my three English requirements, they did pursue them, and they did grow in those areas. And, I believe they grew more in the areas of reading, thinking, and writing than they do in a normal English class. Did I teach perfectly? No. Could I have done things in a better fashion? Of course! After all, I’m learning as well. Did I teach the subjects as I ought to teach in my situation? Yes!


Many of these students can’t read, think, and write because they have been so rarely asked to read, think, and write that they lack both the fundamental skills used in reading, thinking, and writing, and the confidence to believe they are capable of good reading, thinking, and writing.


My classes, especially during the last semester, without question, chewed, reviewed, and digested more text, with the possible exception of AP English, than any other class in JHHS. We hammered our books and then some. Now of course, I commonly got the complaint, “I don’t understand any of this Mr. X.” So, we went over it again, we discussed it in class, we wrote about it; I did everything short of spoon-feeding them the answers. How else are my freshmen going to become better at reading Shakespeare than by actually sitting down, and reading and interpreting, line by line, a piece of literature created by old Bill? How else are my Juniors going to become better at reading Romantic literature than by actually sitting down, and reading and interpreting, line by line, poetry from Emily Dickinson? You get the picture. True exposure through actual experience with the text seemed like a keen idea to me. 


When I look back in history and literature, I don’t look at someone’s grammatical perfection and say, “Oh my gosh, that is great writing.” Half the time I don’t even say, “that was well said.” In reality, I look for ideas; I look for the thinking behind the writing. I want to see how that literature influenced the world around the author, and how that literature shaped who I am today. I want to see what is happening today, think about those events with an educated perspective, and react and communicate respectively to current events. If anything, I hope I ingrained that belief into my students.


Over and over and over again I asked the same question about every piece of literature or writing assignment: what is the meaning and purpose? Those are the fundamental questions my students should always be striving to answer when they read a book, glance over a magazine article, watch a TV show, listen to a guest speaker at a rally, or are subject to any form of communication.


My students’ first writing-hurdle was to get them to simply get words on a page. Once a person is comfortable with that process, then I can help them (him/her, whatever, I prefer the plural neuter) become better writers. I refuse any meta-teaching example that would say otherwise. If I can’t get my students to write anything in the first place, then what is the point of teaching them the fantastically interesting minutiae of academic writing. Once my students were open to writing, then and only then could we begin working on the important characteristics of good writing and the processes involved in creating a well-written piece. Some students did reach this stage, and the structure, reasoning, and clarity of their writing benefited from advice and practice. Many of my students barely reached this stage. Yet, they were required to work in areas that needed work. It honestly warms my heart to see kids like Rakeya Bennett, bless her heart, actually completing her On-Demand test because they felt more secure in communicating their thoughts (or lack thereof in some cases). 


What did I enjoy about teaching?


I love to see people think, and I did see kids think. I love being challenged by my students, and I was certainly challenged! As I said earlier, learning and teaching is a calling. I am fulfilled in a world of knowledge. A number of times I was able to share that world with my students. Generally, I was fascinated by two groups of students. The first being the academic superstars, kids who I know have the potential to influence the world with their minds. Some of these received the benefit of my empathies, advice, and even new approaches to a number of subjects. The second group is composed of the kids that tried their hardest, even if they didn’t succeed. These kids were great—I loved their attitude towards learning and life. I believe they will be successful and influential in virtue of their sincere effort.


My students were asked to read and write so much it eventually became habit. That is what I want! Only after developing the habit of reading and writing can I help them to cultivate and hone their skills. Most of my kids genuinely benefited from my class, and I am pleased by their growth. Getting many of my students to actually enjoy reading or writing, sometimes on unexpected subjects, was also truly fulfilling. Not all of my kids are going to enjoy the classics or academic writings. And, you know what? That is fine with me. That doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be required to understand the classics or academics, but it does mean we should also strive to help these kids love reading and writing (in whatever subject interests them). After all, the ‘wonderful’ authors we read today were just people that loved to read and write on subjects that were interesting to them. I will be pleased as long as my kids remain, in the pursuit of truth and justice, an integral part of that colossal chain of human communication, in any subject matter, by reading, writing, and communicating from one person to another. Part of “being human” means that you know where you came from, and I think I provided those basics to my kids. I hope they take away the desire to continue reading and writing in the subjects both interesting and uninteresting to them. I was very pleased to see my kids acquire new tastes in reading and writing. I know, as a number of students have written me letters, that I have made a very positive impact in their lives, both academically and socially.


Sometimes I felt like a proud parent of these kids, even if I’m not their mom or dad. My effort this year was well spent on my students. I learned about my students, the school system, and myself. I have had to ask myself, if I really care about these kids, what is the best thing I can do to help them? I believe I can achieve more for the world elsewhere. Who knows where I will be ten years from now? Hopefully, I will be learning and teaching. 


Who am I?


I believe the above question is very relevant for anyone who wishes to teach. You don’t teach for the money. You don’t teach because it is fun. You teach for other reasons, some of which are connected to your identity and purpose. In my evaluation of the past year, the question, “Who am I,” came up often.


I am a pessimist and a skeptic, and for good reason (and hell yes, I am a pessimist about whether it is a good thing to be a pessimist). One should always question the status quo; one should always ask the question ‘why’; one should always pursue truth and justice. The pursuit of truth and the questioning of claims in general are a necessary part of the development of civilization. My lack of optimism about the state of our world, and even the state of this school, does not allow me to simply remove myself from the world. Instead, such an awful set of circumstances requires, as my duty, that I find, choose, and execute the best possible plan to address the situation. The common response to a person who complains about an institution is: “then get in the trenches and fix it yourself.” I believe I have been in the trenches long enough to identity the major problems, and I also believe that fixing it cannot occur within the walls of John Hardin alone. Rather, a philosophical change in the overall population must occur. My purpose is to change that overall opinion, whether it be politically, socially, or educationally, and to pursue truth and justice as realities. I find that Post-modern relativism is highly destructive. The question I have been trying to answer over the past year has been: “what can I do to stop post-modernism?” I’m still trying to find the answer. I don’t believe I can effectively fight post-modern relativism in this setting, thus my purpose is not to teach in JHHS.


I am a hardcore theist, philosopher, existentialist, and Christian (all of which are quite related). I’m not concerned with what will make my life comfortable. I am not generally concerned with other people’s opinions of me. I just know that I have a purpose, and I must fulfill it at all costs. 


Part of my journey has led to me to and through JHHS. I thank you for letting me be here to learn, teach, and experience. 

Sincerely,
