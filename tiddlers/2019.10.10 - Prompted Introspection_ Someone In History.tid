title: 2019.10.10 - Prompted Introspection: Someone In History

!! If you could have been someone in history, who would you have been?

Do I have to be exactly them? Do I make all the same choices by definition? What are we essentially beyond our choices in a context with qualia locked inside us? It wouldn't be me, of course. How much of myself do I keep when I wake up inside their body? I cannot solve the Ship of Theseus problem either. I do not know how to talk about this transition of the ghost between shells well enough. It is easier to think of what it means to transition into blanker* hardware, but even that is flawed. Part of who I am is written into my hardware. It appears even my limbs and context define who I am to some extent. I need more information to give an answer I'm satisfied with.
