* Stunning!
** http://www.socialisteconomist.com/2018/05/how-unequal-are-world-incomes.html
*** I've had a hard time coming up with a way to talk about it. Powerful argument here, and it's in line with much of the other data I'm worried about.
** https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-this-thing-for-which-we-have-no-name
*** This is a weird commit here. I think this person is truly evil. This piece is all over the fucking place. It's still worth your time.

* Think About It
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/magazine/the-strange-case-of-the-missing-joyce-scholar.html
*** Perhaps I can do this for myself
** http://www.socialisteconomist.com/2018/04/work-might-be-meaningful-within.html
*** My worry is that this organic organization is just another State of Nature. In a sense, the goal of the market is to enable anarchy, and we have to powerful regulate it (way, way beyond a Neoliberal's point of view). We can never truly destroy the market because we can't destroy the State of Nature (nor the freedoms we expect for all people in many respects).
*** I think we have to have the Rule of Law, and there is no escaping the centralization of power to some extent. There are decentralizations to build, of course.
** https://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/j-w-mason-market-police
*** I've been reading some in the area. Maybe I should go further.
** http://www.zerothposition.com/2018/06/10/dealing-doxxing/
*** This issue arises for me constantly when I think about the complete lack of privacy and near complete lack of anonymity on this site.
** https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8q8edw/donald_trump_accuses_india_of_charging_100_tariff/e0hkz5h/
*** I agree with much of the argument. I think there is supreme lack of compassion though, and I don't think you've done shit to provide serious alternatives either. When you start paying people to retool and school, to maximize our mobility, etc., then come talk to me.
** https://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2018/05/20/1057106_social-media-linked-to-mental-illness.html
*** I'd like to see some stats on social-aggregators. I use Reddit and HN heavily.

** https://www.wikitribune.com/story/2018/06/02/china/why-americans-dont-know-about-huawei/73090/
