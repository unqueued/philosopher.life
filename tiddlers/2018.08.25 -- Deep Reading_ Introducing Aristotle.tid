title: 2018.08.25 -- Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

//Dedicated to Saint Aristotle//

Prepare to wrestle with me you graphic summary. You invoke my teacher's name! I'm going to take you task. You are free to disagree with me, but you better do the man justice! I'm here to channel Leo Strauss (my teacher's teacher's teacher) once again to defend the honor of a man to whom I am forever indebted.

I appreciate the light historical touches to the intro of this intro. =)
