title: 2019.09.19 - Prompted Introspection: Loyalty

!! How loyal are you?

To whom or what? [[gfwiwcgws]]. I tend to be absurdly loyal, sacrificially. I'd rather end my life than give up my integrity. It's all I have. I aim to be justifiably loyal, which just is to say justified or the Pauline "righteoused." The good ol' boys' definition is garbage. I have anti-social characterstics, but there is clearly a distinction between [[The Moral Law]] and mere social convention. Never forgetti, it's a me, [[h0p3]]. I work hard not to give up on what matters most.

Ironically, depending on the interlocutor and mode of this question, we may suffer the liar's paradox in a way. Even if I were radically disloyal in how I answered this question, how could you know?
