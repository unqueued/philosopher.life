title: 2020.01.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sore

* Woke multiple times, but 1 is when I got up.
** I did get some sleep. I'm grateful for that.
* My offspring failed. I'm shocked.
* Daughter attempted to help speak with Xfinity, but we lacked any immediate access to my wife's accounts. The operator was nice enough to work with me though. We have a working modem.
** I'm grateful that she attempted to save my voice.
* Read
* Fireman Time!
* Talked briefly with [[Charlie]].
** I'm glad I was finally able to get in touch with him. I wish I had a voice today. 
** Talked about [[m17]].
** Told me about his job and the power structures around him. 
*** Nice part about [[Charlie]] is that I can just sit and listen as he rolls.
** I'm touched to hear him say "I love you." 
* Cleaning
* Read+Write
* Interesting to hear about people my wife has met at Yale who are currently quarantined and waiting for the CDC to clear them (making sure they don't have coronovirus).
* Mailed [[m17]] to [[Charlie]].
* Grabbed a slice 
* Returned router/modem combo to xfinity. We are set.
** Manny didn't understand what I was looking for either (just a modem, homie!...then he started talking about wireless AP on the modem we bought ?)...He must have been nodding his head blankly in agreement with me before. I'm grateful that he took the time to try to help.
* Lemon-honey tea, ftw.
* Read+Write
