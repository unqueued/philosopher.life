title: Certainty

//Certainly, after awaiting an eternity, through clear, distinct, pathologically [[hope]]ful, cocksure, and pure methodical doubt we can each and all know that: (1) half a dull loaf is better than no bread, (2) nothing is certain except death and taxes, except, but ofc, the possibility of cryonics and creative accounting, and (3) certainty is certainly an epistemic error in all possible cases. Under closure, belief and doubt define each other to some [[dok]]. [[Faith]] is our plight, or so I have [[faith]]. Insofar as [[The Other]] as the Reality of the Ideal can be [[named]]: the necessarily incoherent, inconsistent, immutable mutability of the incompletion of the closure, [[The Dialectic]]al [[End]] of the [[Dialetheia]], awaits us all. So, pick your Bobbing turtles wisely.//

Anything that admits the slightest doubts I will set aside as if I have found it to be wholly false, and I will proceed in this way until I recognize something certain.

What exactly is [Descartes] thinking? Perhaps this: 'The senses sometimes deceive us. So for all we know, they always deceive us'.  But this is a bad argument – a fallacy. Compare: 'Some banknotes are forgeries. So for all we know, they all are forgeries'. Here, the conclusion is impossible, since the very notion of a forgery presupposes valid notes...we only know that the senses sometimes deceive us because further investigation - using the same senses – show that they have done so.

If you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty.

The quest for certainty blocks the search for meaning. Uncertainty is the very condition to impel man to unfold his powers.

Since we can never know anything for sure, it is simply not worth searching for certainty; but it is well worth searching for truth; and we do this chiefly by searching for mistakes, so that we have to correct them.

Doubt is to certainty as neurosis is to psychosis. The neurotic is in doubt and has fears about persons and things; the psychotic has convictions and makes claims about them. In short, the neurotic has problems, the psychotic has solutions.

* Definitions
** The state of being definite or of having no doubts at all about something.
** Perfect knowledge that has total security from error.
** Total continuity and validity of all foundational inquiry, to the highest degree of precision, such that skepticism cannot obtain.
** A lack of doubt about some state of affairs.
** Degrees of uncertainty
*** Absolute vs virtual/relative certainty: belief that X is 99.999% probable.
**** Certainty, tout court, is the upper limit of confidence.
** Uncertainty
*** a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcome. Epistemic situations involving imperfect or unknown information...
*** [[SO]] uncertainty: represented in probability density functions over (first-order) probabilities, e.g. subjective probabilistic logics that explicitly take uncertain or unreliable source trust into account.
** a proposition is epistemically certain if no proposition has greater warrant than it does
** It is predicated of people, and it is predicated of propositions (and perhaps of ontology for some folks who take fate or causation to be possible veins of certainty).
** Apodicticity, indubitability: Descartes, Kant, Husserl
*** apodeiktikós, a.k.a. demonstrative certainty: incontrovertible, demonstrably true, or certain beyond mere subjective conviction.
**** Contrast to "problematic" modality as merely possible, the "assertoric" that can be empirically tested.
** Either the highest form of knowledge or is the only epistemic property superior to knowledge.


* Confidence vs Certainty
** Confidence should be defined as the probability that a decision or a proposition, overt or covert, is correct given the evidence, a critical quantity in complex sequential decisions. If so, perhaps the term certainty should be reserved to refer to the encoding of all other probability distributions over sensory and cognitive variables.

* Psychological vs. Epistemic
** We can say that a person, S, is psychologically certain of a proposition, p, just in case S believes p without any doubts. 
** The feeling of certainty is not necessarily justified.
** (∀x)(∀P)[Bx(P)⇒P]
*** For all agents and for all propositions, that an agent believes a proposition logically implies that proposition.
** A proposition is epistemically certain if it has maximal warrant (justification).
*** A proposition, p, is propositionally certain for a person, S, just in case S is fully warranted in believing that p and there are no legitimate grounds whatsoever to doubt that p.

* Neurological Explanation
** Our brains are prediction machines seeking energy-efficient feelings and sensibilities of certainty in how we model the world. 
*** When facing uncertainty, adaptive behavioral strategies demand that the brain perform probabilistic optimization computations.
** We are chemically rewarded for pattern-recognition and feeling certain; it's addictive.
** Uncertainty can activate our amygdala.
*** The risks of vagueness, ambiguity, grayness, the unknown, [[The Other]] can be terrifying.
** There are involuntary mechanisms for assessing unconscious cognitive activity, and sometimes our unconscious signals to our consciousness various [[dok]] of confidence, up to and including a feeling of certainty.
** We have to learn to take our guts, intuitions, and sensibilities as tentative ideas that we submit to analysis.
** Recall, we are machines designed to survive the risks inherent in just trying to survive for one more minute.
** The will to power and stoicism is profoundly concerned with recognizing when we’re not in control and recruiting every available neuron to regain control.
** Delusions arise through alterations in certainty judgments, both in low-level interpretations of one's environment and high-level conscious)appraisals of one's beliefs and experiences.

* Examples/Illustrations/Problematics:
** Genius among geniuses Ramanujan was certain about his notebooks. Some were right, and others wrong.
** Uncertainty can more stressful than predictable negative consequences, to the point where we are irrational even with the utilitarian math sitting in front of us.
*** Though, gamblers are addicted to unpredictable good fortune!
** Belief in absolute and certain truth has all too often justified the most inhumane behavior toward those not sharing that truth and that belief.
** Perhaps many take the end of philosophy not to be truth but certainty. Though, obviously, it is [[salience]], the only Object over which we can quantify meaningfully.
** Perhaps absolute certainty is unattainable because our senses cannot give us true knowledge.

* Epistemic vs Ontological
** Certain or uncertain epistemic reality maps do not imply certain or uncertain ontological territories. 

* Econ
** von Neumann-Morgenstern: expected utility model
** Measures of risk aversion, rankings of uncertain prospects, and comparative statics of choice under uncertainty
** Lottery Paradoxes, Fundamental Uncertainty of Probabilistic Inferentialists due to lack of certain epistemic closure and the chance of inconsistency.
** In betting games with logarithmic proper scoring rule, losing an epistemic bet made with absolute certainty corresponds to receiving infinite negative payoff.
** It's a consumer product.

* Physics
** Heisgenburg uncertainty: there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle can be predicted from initial conditions or to what extent such conjugate properties maintain their approximate meaning. It is in general not possible to predict the value of a quantity with arbitrary certainty, even if all initial conditions are specified. 

* Skepticism, Pyrrhonism
** Extreme skepticism: nothing can be known for certain and, therefore, they remain in a perpetual state of knowing nothing. 
** The skeptical perspective seems to be in direct opposition to human nature and only provides us with a viewpoint that is depressing and meaningless without any purpose or order.

The king wanted to go fishing, and he asked the royal weather forecaster the forecast for the next few hours. The palace meteorologist assured him that there was no chance of rain.

So the king and the queen went fishing. On the way he met a man with a fishing pole riding on a donkey, and he asked the man if the fish were biting.

The fisherman said, "Your Majesty, you should return to the palace! In just a short time I expect a huge rain storm."

The king replied: "I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an educated and experienced professional. Besides, I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him."

So the king continued on his way.

However, in a short time a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked. Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the meteorologist.

Then he summoned the fisherman and offered him the prestigious position of royal forecaster.

The fisherman said, "Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see my donkey's ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain."

So the king hired the donkey.

And so began the practice of hiring dumb asses to work in influential positions of government. The practice is unbroken to this day.
