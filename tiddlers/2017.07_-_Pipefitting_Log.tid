!! Audit:

* What happened to those $200 from the school? I need to contact them and find out. That's free money, yo.
* I should give my teacher a gift basket. For reals. I ended up not because he ditched me, but I should anyway. I've heard from multiple people that it is pretty incredible how much he has gone to bat for me.
* This month has been a wild fucking ride, no doubt. I started knowing about the job, trying to get my tools and had tons of transitions to make. Good fuckin' job, mate! Noicely, dohne!
* As much as I don't trust the union, I still see them as the best money. I must give far more thought to it.
* The Harbor Freight tools have a 70.32856% success rate. I'll take it. I feel like I was quite economical and wise. I did the best I could with what I had. 
* My electronic devices have been a godsend. They made being away from home bearable. 
* Ha! I said I should find a Wal-mart when I forgot my towel the first time. 
* I was obviously exceptionally stressed this month. My health took a hit for it. 
** I wonder if this is why my wife's health is so poor as well.
* Mitch turns out to be a higher up that doesn't get his hands or clothes dirty, from what I can tell. 
* James, I found out, is VP of the company. I'm glad I made a decent impression with him.
** I obviously did not understand his importance at first. I was right about parts of my feelings about him though. I will continue to pay close attention, I hope.
* Moral Alien Warrior.
* I'm proud of myself. That was a lot to take in.
* Terry rarely beveled. I'm not sure why he did the few times he did.
* I'm going to miss Jaye. I'll try to keep in touch, but I don't know how or what we'll say and do.
* My teacher went to bat for me multiple times. He kept in touch. He genuinely cares about my success.
* Johanna went to bat for me. She has been wonderful.
* You should, again, consider brushing up on your Spanish. None of the pipefitters speak Spanish, but the other kinds of trades and workers often have many Latinos.
* I had less and less to say about my days. I think the novelty and need to digest has waned. This, imho, is a good thing (at least for now).
* One reason I don't think I could work in the office or as management is that I think it requires too much psychopathy.
** Although, my wife is an obvious counterexample.
* I was right about being on Terry's job for only one more week.
* Don't forget to return Tim's tools, with a gift!
* Terry was a complete asshole.
** You did such a good job putting up with it. You had every right not to, but the sacrifice on your mind and body were worth it.
* The money has been wonderfully useful to us.
* I'm really skilled at losing my alignment pin =(, lol.
* I really need to find a way to engrave my name on tools.
* The portfolio is coming along!
** I've forgotten to put some stuff in there, but they are small. I want to make sure big stuff is there though.
* The new clothes have been incredibly wonderful. Thank you, dearest heart!
* RIP Phronesis, I think. Maybe fixable. Will take to Ponders. They'll make the call. The only mechanics I can trust, unfortunately.
* THC test passed in 8 days.
* Bull has, thus far, proven to be a wonderful foreman. I can ask for help on anything. He's never negative towards me. He honestly wants me to succeed, imho. 
** I'm going to miss him.
** Should I do something nice for him? What would it be?
* How did I forget to Math? 
** Only human, homie.
* Eth well spent. 
* I have relaxed and had more fucking around time.
* Once the tools and vehicle are set, I feel like I'll be in damned good shape.
* This has been an exceptionally crazy month, but also very productive. It was quite a learning experience, and extremely stressful. Keep up the good work, homie!
