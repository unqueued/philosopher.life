Whitney came today. She's feeling much better. She seems better too. Good.

Matt continues to interrupt my conversations with people to steer us away from whatever we are talking about. My assumption is that he has conflated social status with merit; he appears to make the mistake often.

I made my usual rounds. 8RR and I spoke about my weirdness for a while. Oh, sweet summer child, you have no idea. The 5th graders didn't have homework, except 5CM. I talked about how he could have way more freetime if he just did it right there on the spot in snackbreak. Wise boy, he did. He loves the computer lab too. 

7MA needs so much help with her math. We walked through some geometry problems which were a pinch above her grade level, imho (but, I think students her age should be able to solve them). I walked through how to reason about a couple of the problems with her, and I said we'd work in the lab on it.

Matt and his fiance can't math, and he screwed up the distribution of pizza slices (a gift from the baseball team). He was snappy about it.

6DM and I talked about entropy, energy, and heat death. He has a special kind of memetic wanderlust in him. May there be legions like the boy, even with his emotional imbalance and violence.

The lab was quiet and wonderful. I talked with various students. 7MA struggled, but she may have broken through! Good for her. =)

I continue to give my disclaimers. Some take it, some don't. 6CM called me "sir" (that is most unbecoming of this rebel). I continue to beg them to break the rules wisely.

Mitchell is Delp today. Man down blows, but otherwise, I'm in heaven.
