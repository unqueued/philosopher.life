title: 2018.08.25 -- Deep Reading: Dune

It's weird. I celebrate re-reading, and yet I know that often I'm just taking a drug when I do for many of my books. I like it directly because I know it will be pleasurable, and I like the feeling of certainty. Who doesn't? Of course, these lenses do change for me over time, and they still change me differently upon different readings. I don't want to confabulate though.

I am ever in need of Christ-figure lenses.

I need me some poise, yo.

I'm just fucking giddy in this book. It's insane. The Jessica-Hawat encounter is so vivid to me!
