title: 2019.01.21 - Kitty Kat Korner: Ranga and The Lamp

We have a lamp built from fancy lookin' washers. It looks neat because you can see through the hollow areas. Ranga sat for almost half an hour with half his face peeking out and half his face behind the lamp looking through. It must have been an interesting perspective. I have played many such visual games. I watched him from the other side. The cat has clearly been exploring inside the house more these past few days (somehow the removal of the piano has activated something in him).
