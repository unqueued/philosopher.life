Occupation: Craftsman

He needs to build things with his hands. It is not obvious that he will excel in academics. He has to do his best no matter what, since that's part of being a complete a human and achieving eudaimonia. I need to help him be as happy as he can be though. I think moving towards the practical trades will be his best option. 

I regret that I don't have the tools to teach him, but I can get him on his way as I acquire the assets and capital as we need to really practice. I want a shop for him to spend his time working in.

Let's say we did Pipefitting and Welding. I could teach him how. I'd be willing to pay him to learn this even. I want him to practice to the point that at (would apply to the union at 17, or he'd be working with me) that at 18 he could start making seriously good money, learning the socioeconomic and political landscape enough to see how he fits in, to see a path to success, and to see he's already well on his way.
