*** You've solved nothing. You buy the normativity of modality or you don't, and really, you either buy modality or you don't. The normativity necessarily springs out.

* Think About It

*** "the constitution of personal identity is inseparable from the process of self-externalizing"
*** "It is memory,” he claimed, “that really reveals us to ourselves."
*** We are performers before [[The Moral Law]] as well. Who are we trying to impress and why? Choose wisely.
*** "if you perpetually involve people in the work of becoming themselves, they will never be themselves"
**** Really? God damn, I feel like myself pretty thoroughly in this space. There is a metaphysics problem of the being of becoming here as well that I'm not sure can be answered so cleanly. This platform has far more autonomy in it than most kinds of social media though.
*** "Their effect is to stabilize us into routine and predictable patterns of behavior and consumption."
**** Agreed. Control and skinnerboxes. But, that doesn't mean we shouldn't engage in something like this wiki, even if only privately or with a small group of those who we mean to construct ourselves with (and preferably toward decentralized construction of [[TOP]]).
** https://reallifemag.com/new-feelings-screen-protectiveness/
*** The wiki is hardcore, as usual. You simply can't engage in effective empiricism of yourself without evidence. Being open is painful, but it really doesn't have to be narcissistic.
*** "I’m more willing to be exploited than I am to be judged." 
**** Alienation and invalidation are not simple problems.
** https://philosophynow.org/issues/130/Francis_Cricks_Deliberately_Provocative_Reductionism
*** Memory, syntactic sugar, autonomy, and the hard problem of dualism yet again. Still no progress.

*** Lol. Look at that conservative push.

*** What credibility? This is just another iteration of Cold War to maximize the control of the elite and feed the military industrial complexes.
