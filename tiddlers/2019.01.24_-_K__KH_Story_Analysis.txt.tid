title: 2019.01.24 - K: KH Story Analysis
type: text/plain

I’m still thinking about how best to explain it. :joy:

Hope you have a great day today.
THU 8:38 AM
How much of the KH universe have you played?
THU 8:40 AM
I’ve played KH1, CoM, 2, 358/2 Days, Re:Coded, Birth By Sleep, Union X, DDD, 2.8, and 1.5+2.5 HD Remix. 

I promise those names are all real.
THU 8:41 AM
So basically the whole damn thing.
THU 8:42 AM
Aye, have wikipedia open as we are talking
THU 8:43 AM
I wish you Godspeed lmao
THU 8:45 AM
Part of me just wants to find a YouTube video that explains the plot
THU 8:45 AM
Then we can have the conversation easier.
THU 8:45 AM
That's fine too. I have only peripherally looked on KH from afar (I remember when it came out).
THU 8:46 AM
Of course, I don't know how you are going to draw the lines to show me "what you think makes a story particularly good."
THU 8:46 AM
But, that is the adventure.
THU 8:46 AM
Clearly I should write a paper on it. :D
THU 8:47 AM
Lol. That could be a paper.
THU 8:47 AM
A long thesis even.
THU 8:47 AM
Devoting an entire page to each game still isn’t enough to properly explain things. It’s ridiculous and an awful way to explain a plot.
THU 8:52 AM
It may take time to crystallize the gem-like thesis which demonstrates why KH is a prime example of good storytelling. I understand there are mountains of supporting evidence.
THU 8:53 AM
Capturing the essence is never easy.
THU 8:54 AM
(and, I understand the reductions are never complete)
THU 8:54 AM
They skipped two games but this is a pretty good summary.
THU 12:24 PM

THU 12:24 PM
Alright, I have watched it. I've decided my favorite character is automagically Aqua qua Tits.
THU 8:22 PM
It sounds like a never-ending story (one of my favorite fantasy books).
THU 8:23 PM
Don’t worry I won’t tell you how old she is.
THU 8:23 PM
;)
THU 8:23 PM
Aqua is a good girl and the only character with a lick of damn sense.
THU 8:24 PM
Alright, so why do you think this is an example of good storytelling?
THU 8:24 PM
I think it’s a good story told badly.
THU 8:25 PM
Alright, what makes it a good story?
THU 8:25 PM
I think if you peel back all of the convoluted parts then what is left is a cast of characters that are firmly established from the very beginning of their respective stories with clear goals, aspirations, strong sense of alignment and character arcs that are consistent to the point that charcters never fee like parodies of themselves.
THU 8:29 PM
Feel*
THU 8:29 PM
It’s the characters that make this dumb story great.
THU 8:29 PM
The villains don’t have clear goals, but everyone else does.
THU 8:29 PM
You sound like some philosophers I know when you say that. Some have defined autonomy like that.
THU 8:30 PM
Fascinating.
THU 8:30 PM
Just looking at Sora, the main character. We see him in his natural habitat at the beginning of his story. We meet his friend and get to see how he acts on a daily basis as well as learning quickly what his goals are in life.
THU 8:31 PM
Why don't you think any of the villain's have clear goals?
THU 8:31 PM
villains*
THU 8:31 PM
I'm not qualified to say you are wrong, obviously. The video seems to provide evidence to the contrary.
THU 8:32 PM
Mostly because they change what Kingdom Hearts is between every damn games. Haha
THU 8:32 PM
Game***
THU 8:32 PM
Gotcha. Let me explain.
THU 8:32 PM
So Xehanort is the big bad with the ultimate goal of recreating the x-blade in order to open kingdom hearts and harness enough energy to make his own world where he is a god and in charge of it all. First he needed a body because he was old, so he got one, but since he was unable to use the x-blade due to the events in BBS, he instead opted to use the princesses of heart to try to forge the x-blade which didn’t really work out, so he descended into the realm of darkness and just so happened to find the door to Kingdom Hearts at the end of all of the worlds? He also claimed that it was fulfilled with pure supreme darkness but when he opened it a shit ton of came out and killed him. 

And that’s without explaining the heartless/nobody nonsense. So then his nobody finds a separate kingdom hearts that floats on the sky? And apparently it’s the same or different. (They never say!) but it doesn’t work out because the power of anime and friendship is what kills him too.
THU 8:37 PM
So then he decides to go after the x blade stuff again and they find out that he’s been trying to do that all along with his organization, then they drop the news that he’s also a time traveler which opens up several other cans of worms. Lol
THU 8:38 PM
Because he can only travel to past incarnations of himself. But why?
THU 8:39 PM
Why not just go back to the battle in BBS and overpower the kids with his other self?
THU 8:39 PM
It appears there are many versions of the enemy, their identities lack integrity, etc. They each seem goal-oriented, though I cannot say their persistent identities are coherent (but...this may be a sliding scale for all kinds of persons). It sounds like the villains are a result of money-grab bad writing, as you pointed out (bad storytelling, but good story via characters). It sounds like they need conflict, and they have to incoherently generate new conflicts to continue producing games to sell.
THU 8:40 PM
Exactly.
THU 8:41 PM
You like the good characters. That's what makes this a good story.
THU 8:41 PM
The amount of retconning is a massive detriment to it all
THU 8:41 PM
Good characters can hold up a bad story.
THU 8:41 PM
I would like another example of it.
THU 8:42 PM
I’m not fully convinced that the other way around works.
THU 8:42 PM
I am convinced it is much easier to go the other way.
THU 8:42 PM
That's what anti-hero stories do.
THU 8:42 PM
Sorry. By bad I mean unrealistic
THU 8:43 PM
Another example of bad story good characters?
THU 8:44 PM
Do you think you like the story so much because you grew up with it?
THU 8:46 PM
Will you look back on this fondly but eventually find it too unrealistic or lacking in depth?
THU 8:47 PM
I know there is nostalgia here.
THU 8:47 PM
My last read of the HP series had that problem.
THU 8:47 PM
But I talk so much shit about the entries that have problems. Haha
THU 8:47 PM
Yeah? How so?
THU 8:47 PM
That is a long list. You can check my wiki. I do a book by book analysis. The basic problem is that the stories aren't coherent. They aren't realistic enough given the contingent truths. This is part of my problem with X-men. No world that had powers like those would look anything like the stories we've been told if we were being honest about the consequences.
THU 8:48 PM
It is my opinion that good fiction  requires, to some non-trivial extent, the ability to adjust those contingent truths and still tell a coherent story. Coherent world-building (which includes the characters) is an art.
THU 8:49 PM
I understand it's my duty to suspend disbelief in charity, of course.
THU 8:49 PM
I've read them many times, and each time, they lose magic for me because the holes grow bigger and bigger. The meaning becomes weaker and weaker.
THU 8:50 PM
I look at Dune as an epic example of fiction done well (and there is literally an all-powerful Christ figure in there)..it stands the test of time.
THU 8:52 PM
That's part of what makes it a good story and good storytelling (I'm not sure how well those can really be peeled apart, btw).
THU 8:53 PM
Of course, I appreciate the "coherent for whom?" standard. What makes a good story scales to the audience.
THU 8:57 PM
I'm looking for the universals across that relative scaling (assuming there are any such principles).
THU 8:57 PM
The good characters still feel coherent despite the flaws, as you've said. One of my worries is that the good characters only have meaning in virtue of the concept of badness. I think it detracts from them.
THU 9:01 PM
This is one of the problems I had in the original movie version of Dune. The producers turned the antagonist into an incoherent character, and it diminishes the protagonist because of it too.
THU 9:05 PM
Defeating coherent evil is somehow more meaningful than defeating incoherent evil.
THU 9:05 PM
(insofar as evil can be coherent)
THU 9:05 PM
I’ve heard very good things about Dune!

I also completely agree about antagonists too. Because true battles between opposite sides should be fought by a collision of ideals which is lost if the villain is incoherent. 

Have a great day today!
FRI 8:40 AM
You too! =)
