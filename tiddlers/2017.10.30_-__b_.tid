* My children must learn economics, understanding what humans value, understanding their belief->action relationship systems, understanding human as computers, understanding human psychology. This is the Redpilled Science. Add in a practical understanding of energy, what is physically possible, and you have yourself a powerful discipline.

* Old-wives tale psychology in the empathy stories of the Humanities. These are the qualitative sides to the quantitative Redpill Science.

* You must place and lift your tentpegs in the desert. You wander. You develop heuristics and hedges for wandering the desert safely. You dev the right social networks. You develop the right memetic network. Only the Spiritual Sarduakar emerge from profound Survival of The Fittest ancient desert tribalism eternal war, and their memes are truly fit in a sense. Something about them is quite an addiction, powerful, makes one more adaptive and capable of solving the problems in the desert.
** We are existential nomads.

* I want to write a book that would exist in the singularity, to be a corner of it. That's not the claim there will be a singularity, but it is a kind of hope. Hope that the future can be better is not evil. We can take up prudentially, even when we can't take it up alethically. 

* Prudential and Alethic Reasoning
** How much of Prudential can be converted into Alethic reasoning with careful thought?
*** Are there at least possible Alethic points of view which are prudential? What are those?

Most of the Ancients specialists of the philosophers I've known were egoists or relativists trying to move that direction.

* 1/4 < 1/6 iff 1/6 > 1/4
** Obtains in all possible worlds, thus not merely //iff//, but Logically Equivalent
** These have the same semantics in the broad, general logical notions. They share the same truth values in all possible worlds.
** The do not have the same semantics in other contexts, for example, Truth-Function Logic.
*** That logic is incapable of finding important inferences.
*** That logic is wrong sometimes. 
*** Those who are tempted to think the above statements aren't semantically identical (logically equivalent) have failed to be logical in some sense. They have taken up a subset of general logic to be their general logic, at least in that context.
** Thus, the various forms of the Categorical Imperative are semantically identical, and presumably, are logical truth like 4+4=8. Somehow, we made them. They have to predate us though, or they aren't universal. What does it mean to say we made a universal truth? This is a metamodern diamond. It is part of the metanarrative we must take up in faith to have anything in the first place.
*** Essentially, neo-Kantians must see themselves as metamodernly hurling or clawing towards the absolute, unconditional truth (or some semblance of it, even after postmodern deconstructions).

When do you write in paragraphs and when do you write in bullet points? Yes, bullet-points outline and can even form the quantitative aspect of paragraphs, but there is a mindset and phenomenological difference. You are thinking with a different part of your brain when you switch between the two.

When my friend ALM uses the phrase "mumbo jumbo," he is almost always defensively lashing out at what he doesn't understand and often doesn't want to understand. He doesn't like doing theory or skilling up his alteration on his cleric, especially not in real life. He knows it will be painful to look at it, not just because it takes work, but because it requires understanding where he has been wrong, understanding how imperfect he is. He is a man who has been so hurt by others and himself that can't allow himself to empathize, feel, or infer as others. He can only be honest with himself to a degree and from a particular point of view; all else hurts too much.

You know what you don't get to do in Academic Philosophy? Directly call someone evil. It's uncouth. Even the sociopaths know better. They climb that ladder by not saying the truth they know. That lack of intellectual honesty lacks epistemic integrity. And, yet, such a system is still extremely synergistic and productive.

Very few have seen the monster inside you. I can show the world who you really are.

Extended adolescence makes sense in the metamodern narrative. It's a fact of post-modernism that we simply can't know all there is to know, and probably not even what we need to know, but we try anyway. Importantly, what is necessary for the hyper-competitive world and what is necessary for even making sense of the world and ourselves is a standard that continues to rise over the ages. With selection for intelligence and knowledge, it becomes harder and harder to have matured. #Adulting gets harder.

You taught me how to be alone. As Indiana Jones might say, you taught me "self-reliance." I've learned you aren't going to be there for me when I really need it. You really don't care. Lol.

"Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth."

"It's one of my theories that if you make a profound enough correlation that has no actual relation to the truth that people will eat it up anyways."

"People talk to themselves at other people."

"When people give you advice, they are really just talking to themselves in the past."
