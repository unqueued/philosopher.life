//Professor R!, I aim to steelwoman you like so few of your other students. You will be able to say I do not understand, but you will not be able to say I did not try. It seems crucial to have your feedback evaluate my interpretation of you and your work. Help me not misunderstand you. Please forgive me for not speaking your language as well as you do.//

Q: How many Hegelians does it take to screw in a light bulb?

A: Two, of course. One stands at one end of the room and argues that it
isn’t dark; the other stands across from him and says that true
light is impossible. This dialectic creates a synthesis when the
bulb gets screwed in.

* Bare Quotes
** I soon rejected not just Hegel but all forms of traditional Philosophy as a “house of cards,” to paraphrase Wittgenstein.
** I was able to witness at first-hand the baleful effect that Dialectical ‘Logic’ can have on revolutionary politics — in this case, on local party activists.
** I have no axioms (I challenge you to find one) and I am a materialist. [[(source)|https://athens.indymedia.org/post/858294/]]
** Red Menace is my other name. [[(s)|https://histomatist.blogspot.com/2005/10/dkw-stephen-and-feudal-anarchy-in-uk.html]]

* Philosophical Descriptions
** She's been thinking about these problems since at least the 1970's. 
** She explains how Hegelian readings of Marx, starting with Engels, have posed major philosophical and political problems for pro-working-class politics.
** A Logically-Talented Wittgensteinian Physicalist/Nominalist/Materialist Anti-Hegelian Marxist Trotskyist
*** Apologizes for a strict Historical Materialism.
** Naturally talented in paranoic reasoning about the material implications of memetics.

* The Dialectic
** Her enemies believed ‘dialectical’ thinking meant there were no ‘fixed or rigid principles.’
*** Oh. I adore that she is opposed to this. Odd to say one has no axioms though. 
** ‘Dialectical’ arguments of remarkable inconsistency were used to ‘justify’ every convoluted change of emphasis, and counter every objection (declaring them one and all “abstract”), no matter how reasonable they might otherwise seem. Comrades who were normally quite level-headed became almost monomaniacal in their zeal to search out and re-educate those who were not quite 100% with the program.
*** Hrm. Her argumentation, in part, feels like this to me. I'm not against it conceptually (and I'm not claiming she's a hypocrite), but it's a concern.

* Her Enemies
** The Failed Revolutionary Parties
** People who aren't even attempting to listen to her (understandably), or people she perceives as such.

* Feelings
** She's a genius. Look at her go. 
*** It seems uncharitable to claim she is a one-dimensional crusader; she's closer to a philosopher of one book though (which is not conceptually problematic).
** She's exceptionally combative, antagonistic, proactively inserting herself (almost trollishly) into public conversations.
*** Her shadowboxer is anything but plain; she is oddly pointy, detailed yet huge, hard-as-steel, ripped, dressed-to-the-nines, maybe even sparkly, with sick moves. 
** She's mean sometimes (lawd!). 
** I'd love to see her history with and the manners in which she plays complex recreational games.
** Looks like she's been through some hell. 
*** I aim to disagree with her with the utmost respect, in the same way as I do with [[Sir GB]] (a man I owe my life to).
*** That is quite a point of view, a history, and a profoundly sharp system.
** Surely, she would agree: 
*** Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.
** She obviously gives a realist's fuck! DAAAAAAMN! Amazing! Wonderful! Huzzah! It is truly necessary for being a [[good]] philosopher.
*** Now, I'm interested to see if she gives an idealist's fuck. Her home is gorgeously decorated. It's stunning, posh, brilliant!
**** Regardless of her ability to articulate a foundation to metaethics, I adore how moral she aims to be.
**** It is profoundly my honor to know her at all.
** Like, who doesn't have a problem with dogma [[irwrongfrr]]? It is, of course, extremely difficult to define authoritarian, fascist, freedom, justification, etc.
** One thing aspect I enjoy about engaging her is that I don't need to fight for some crucial sections of what it means to be a [[good]] political animal with her (and that's usually my initial practical problem with anyone). We have some commonground I don't find in many analytic philosophers.
** I don't mind her redundancy. I appreciate her drafting and disorganization (yet obvious attention to detail). I suggest we both have the same kind of crazy. =)
*** Hopefully, I will not have earned disrespect.
