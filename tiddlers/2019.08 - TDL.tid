!! Audit:

* I'm doing well with my public children, poorly with my offspring. =/
** Transitions in our computer weren't smooth, and transitions to my work made it very rocky.
*** We've halted downloading most everything, but we have plenty for what we do. 
** It's okay. There's going to be ups and downs. It's okay that systems take time to grow.
* Completely failed to convince myself to write letters.
* WoW was everything on the brain.
* Meal planning was loose, and only partially accurate.
* I made little progress on [[monster-16]]. I've got the basics, and now it's just piecing stuff together.
* Indeed, this is what it feels like when I just want to have fun.
* I'm grateful that I did accomplish many of these tasks.
