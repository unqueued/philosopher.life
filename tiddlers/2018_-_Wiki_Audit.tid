!! Audit:

* That XX-YY dating scheme is ugly as fuck.
* I completely stopped auditing for the longest time.
** Why? I need to have a good look at that in [[The Remodeling]].
* [[j3d1h]] and [[Sphygmus]] show up quite a bit. 
* [[The Remodeling]] has been a huge undertaking. It's doing the work that was originally intended by the [[audit]] as a yearly notion. The object is simply too big for me to traverse (and get everything else done).
* The [[audit]] is clearly interested in turning the sidebar into a beautiful [[SO]] machine.
* Figuring out how to be programmatic from the outside has been difficult.
** There are simply too many things for me to think about. I can't reason fast enough. I feel like I'm drowning.
* Sometimes this log is heaven (music to my ears), but sometimes this log pushes me to the limit. I can't see that far.
** This is obviously a huge source of anxiety for me.
* It seems to me that [[FTO]] and my [[4DID]] have lit a fuse on this bomb.
** It feels like [[Link Log]] on crack, targeting my wiki.
* This log is me taking my project as seriously as I can. It's hard fucking work.
** Does it ever get easier?
** Will I look back on this and feel like I did the right thing, walked the best path available to me, etc.?
** I'm committed. This object is it. It's the only lens I have.
** I have to admit, I feel like I'm losing my sanity.
