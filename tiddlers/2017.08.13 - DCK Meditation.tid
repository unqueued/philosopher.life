Who was I when I was a kid? How are my kids doing comparatively?  

Is this the right question? Even when you do everything you can to equate, equalize, generate equivalences, etc., it isn't the right measure.

Just do your best. That is all you have. Set it aside, and do your best (however vacuous that sounds).

Help your children be happy. It takes time, energy, effort, planning, and integrity to build that happiness. You can do it!

I'm gonna bet that most people think this wiki is a bit crazy. What can I say? Taking the time to write it down is crazy in the eyes of most people. Lol. Who the fuck does that? 

Me.

Closed-eyed is quite strong today. I haven't used in a very long time. It amazes me how such a small dose knocks me on my ass. I understand the tolerance and half-life of the chemical. I use it very carefully, and I'm glad I do. It is not simply temporarily mind-altering, in terms of perceptions (which goes on to permanently affect how I think about and see the world).

I can feel the itchiness of my eczema even through this. That is interesting. It's been a year since I've had it. I'm glad I went to the doctor for it. There wasn't any time for it, and money was a concern. Now, I feel like I can stop holding my breath and breathe. I think we've been doing well.

You have such a good job searching for and cultivating your sanity. This has not been easy. It has been a difficult journey.

Capitalism really is crushing us all. I will find a way for my family survive and thrive, nonetheless.

OMG! MR. ROBOT KEEPS A JOURNAL! Hello World.

His journal doesn't seem to help him. Mine does. The show has many deep flaws in it. 

The problem with his journal was a singular, oversimplified aim for control. It lacked stoicism. On top of that, he had his mental difficulties.

I want to earn enough for my children to see therapists for the rest of their lives. They need people who can help hack their brains. My goal for our survival obviously includes a kind of mental integrity and happiness that I must ensure for my children. We've got a lot of crazy in our family, a lot of crazy in the world, and I think it is worth it. I need to prepare for the possibility that they will have complicated, difficult mental lives. They will. They have my genes and memes.

Inch by inch, I move towards my goal of happiness for my family. I see it in small ways. I see my son, with his tools, with his verbosity, with his expressiveness, his emotion, and thoughtfulness, with his interest in appearance (even though he is autistic, he cares about his appearance), with his desire, will, and even hope. It fills me with joy. I see my daughter, with her awesome weirdcore style, her imagination, her leaps of logic, her penetrating comprehension, and her will to make her life better. It fills me with joy. 

I'm actually happier about how unschooling is going. They are working! It may not be perfect, but I think there is hope here.

My wife continues to work towards what is ailing her as well. I feel stupid saying it, but it was my wife who taught me to take care of myself, to be my own advocate, to actually pursue it. I know I made fun of her WebMD syndrome, but she is right. That is a woman of integrity, let me tell you what. Without her ability to empathize, to pursue healing, this would not have a worked. That was a crucial meme for us. Thank you, my love! You kindle the spark of hope in me. You help me see when I am blind. I could never have dreamed of your love.

Getting the first few gears lock into place is always the hardest, bumpiest part. We're doing it though. The machine is moving. It's still a bumpy ride, no doubt. But, it is moving. I feel like Anakin "It's working, it's working!" (however, shitty the narrative, I'm still bound to some of its emotions).
