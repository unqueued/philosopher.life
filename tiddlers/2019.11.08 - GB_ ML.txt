I understand if you're hesitant to help me

Or refuse to. No hard feelings. I wouldn't completely respect that
Nov 8, 2019 6:44am
I appreciate that!

How's your week going?
Nov 8, 2019 10:31am
Mehta, trying to wrap up chapter 2. You? Getting ready to move?
Nov 8, 2019 1:45pm
Yeah, we're still thinking about how all the pieces are going to fit together.
Nov 8, 2019 1:45pm
Playing with this terribly fun toy (GPT2 was completely released): https://talktotransformer.com/

You should take your most important sentence from that chapter and run it through a couple times just see what you get.

My friend Sphygmus ran this phrase from my {About} through it: I quietly write this existentially isolating autopoietic self-idiom to (and seek the approval of) both current and future}

...generations of autists. It is my hope that by sharing this with you, I may one day be able to pass my wisdom onto future generations of Autistic people and vice versa.

I'm an autist and I have no words for this. I don't know how to explain it. The way it feels is that I've just experienced a very powerful and deeply personal moment of self-discovery. I feel that I have seen into the core of my very own being and the self that others can only see by viewing their own behavior.

This is a very emotional and powerful thing to say, so if I get it wrong or it's unclear in any way, please know I am very, very sorry.

So if you're an autist and you want to...

Lol.
Nov 8, 2019 1:48pm

Haha yeah I played with it a bit too. I ran some philosophical observations through it to see what it would spit out. Some were good, some not as good
Nov 10, 2019 5:33pm
Aye. Same. I am still dumbstruck by it. 
Nov 10, 2019 5:34pm
It is pretty impressive
Nov 10, 2019 5:39pm
I'm not 100% sure it's as perfect as the cautions warrant
Nov 10, 2019 5:39pm
But like deepfakes I think the trajectory of the technology is worrying
Nov 10, 2019 5:40pm
I hear that.
Nov 10, 2019 5:40pm
I have no idea how to draw the lines well enough.
Nov 10, 2019 5:41pm
I will say GPT-2 seems to have more immediate threat because it is cheap to deploy. 
Nov 10, 2019 5:41pm
A sybil attack on The Great Human Conversation online is more plausible with GPT-2 than other kinds of counterfeit human communication. Detection is an arms race here. 
Nov 10, 2019 5:45pm
It's hard to know how it might influence the world, but it would do something.
Nov 10, 2019 5:46pm

Sybil attack?
Nov 10, 2019 6:04pm
One attacker masquerades as many agents, and using all of their voices in some fashion has influence on what the other nodes in the network value.
Nov 10, 2019 6:05pm
It floods a network with information that lacks authority. Automated sockpuppets can be made from something like GPT-2 that would snag plenty of people a high enough percentage of the time that I wouldn't be surprised to see it weaponized at some point.
Nov 10, 2019 6:07pm
Even if it all it did was waste time, lower the signal-to-noise ratio, or sow distrust, it could be influential in various communities.
Nov 10, 2019 6:09pm
Disrupting memetic evolution in a population is a possibility with something like this.
Nov 10, 2019 6:09pm
I can definitely see that. Might well already be happening
Nov 10, 2019 6:11pm
Jesus christ about Bolivia. Every day that passes gives me more reason to get tankier and tankier
Nov 11, 2019 12:03am
I am sure the US is going to install good socialist leadership democratically elected by the people. 
Nov 11, 2019 12:06am
I don't know enough, sadly. 
Nov 11, 2019 12:08am
I think I'm getting tankier too.
Nov 11, 2019 12:10am
I'm sure it won't be a neoliberal who opens the country up to multinationals
Nov 11, 2019 12:17am
Pretty sure this is going to massively tankie-fy a lot of left libertarians and anarchists
