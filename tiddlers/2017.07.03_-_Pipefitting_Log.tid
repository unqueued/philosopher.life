title: 2017.07.03 - Pipefitting Log

Today I received a call/text from AB&T explaining they received the letter. They need an accounting for the $200 meant for tools last semester. I never spent the money in the school account. I can't now. The money is in limbo. I actually had hoped to buy pipefitter books instead with it since I was so advanced in the course that it would likely be the wisest use of the money. Secondly, I need to generate the pricing lists. That's what I've been working on today, with the generous help of my wife. We'll try and contact AB&T tomorrow, and if we can't, then the next day. 

The item list is quite expensive. If we got the entire list with decent brands, it will cost up to $2,000. Let's hope the money she set aside can be spent on it. I need it. I'm willing to front the money if I would be immediately reimbursed upon receipt. In a way, I would prefer that, since I can get it through amazon prime. If it can't be done immediately, then I can't afford to do it. I'm thinking I will be going without tools for a while until this gets sorted. I'll still do my best to handle it as quickly as I can. I hope it won't cause any trouble at work for me at my new job.

My brother has been extremely generous to me, giving me a gift of $500 for my birthday. It may be the most expensive birthday gift I've ever received, and we need it. It's an extra boost in a heavy-transition, high-risk situation. I'm so grateful. Times have been tough, and he has been a shining knight for us.

Tomorrow I'll be studying for the last exam and preparing a small gift basket for my teacher. I want to thank him and maintain that relationship.
