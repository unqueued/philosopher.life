I wish there was a better inspection of the relationship of power and corruption. It's not like the books don't scream it, but it doesn't go nearly as far as I'd have liked. Part of the problem may just be his classism.

Going through two books with "The Dark Lord," I think the unspoken, almost gnostic stealth is worth considering. I consider Sauron to be one of the best evil characters I've ever encountered.

Ring of Gyges, as always, screams out. There are clear differences though.

The traveling name is fascinating. I think the exchange between Gandalf and Frodo in the beginning is among my favorites in the entire series. 

I am always amazed at the difference in the propagation of news.
