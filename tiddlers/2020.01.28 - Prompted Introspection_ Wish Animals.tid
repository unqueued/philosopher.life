title: 2020.01.28 - Prompted Introspection: Wish Animals

!! I wish animals could?? If they could, then?..

~~Be such that they maximized justified eudaimonia in all creatures [[irwartfrr]]~~

`/aims-for-silly` 

//**target acquired**//

I wish animals, including hoomins, could time-travel back //iff// they were going to choose (or act, if choice is not available) more wise (or global-utility-maximizing, if wisdom is unavailable) lifepaths. I see a spiral with loops adjusting its direction and growth. I'd like to reward creatures with mutability and freedom if they were going to use it to do what's [[right]]. 

Sorry, Saint Leibniz, clearly not inclined without necessitation, and clearly not the best of all possible worlds. I realize, you wouldn't be heard (and worse) unless you held the deistic bargain up.
