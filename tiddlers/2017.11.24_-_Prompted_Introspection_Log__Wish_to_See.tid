title: 2017.11.24 - Prompted Introspection Log: Wish to See

!! I wish I could see?? because?..

This is problematic, Lady Melisandre. It is very open-ended. What counts as seeing? Do you mean visually see with my eyes, in my mind's eye, or even something more abstract that isn't even fully visualized but just understood, experienced, or known? Must I answer something that exists, could exist, or might not even exist or possibly exist? I would give a very wide variety of answers. Some of these questions simply boil down to asking what I want, who I am, and what I think is meaningful and valuable. These are, of course, important questions to answer. But, I don't think it is practical or even appropriate for me to try to answer these questions here. That's basically the work of this wiki as a whole.

Hence, I will just take the simplest answer and talk about it.

I would love to see your naked body right on top of me.

I'm not well-traveled, but I'm decently traveled for someone with my background and resources. I also don't really give a shit. You've seen a place, you've seen the people, whatever. Things are things. I see more mind-blowing shit on the internet and in a book than I do in the world around me. Of course, I love the fresh scent of the trees and mountains, and I love a beautiful sunset, but those are not ultimately the things which excite my sensitivities the most. 

The experiences I want most are perhaps just simpler (even if somehow no more practical).
