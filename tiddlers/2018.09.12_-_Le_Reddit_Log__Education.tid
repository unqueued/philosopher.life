We probably agree on quite a bit. I'm going to elaborate.

    no education should be worth decades of debt.

Mine is. My education is priceless. My education is fundamental to my identity. I'd rather be dead than lack my education. I'd go into a billion dollars of debt for my education. Plus, it's not like I'm going to pay it off anyways!

I prefer these claims:

* No one should be forced to go into debt to become educated.
* Liber means book and freedom.
* A free (as in freedom), well-rounded education is a moral right of all persons.
* We must vigilantly educate citizens in order for them to participate in and grant informed consent to the coercive powers of democratic governments necessary to maintain the morally justified rule of law (applying the golden rule in political contexts).
* Education is necessary (though not sufficient) to have the psychological means to recognize (and perhaps formulate the means to preventing and reversing) the centralization of power.

That said, I'm an elitist asshole who thinks a non-trivial portion of the people who have acquired a degree really haven't been educated (we have failed them!); instead, they have a piece of paper.
