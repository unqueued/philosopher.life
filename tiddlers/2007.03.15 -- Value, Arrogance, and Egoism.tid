title: 2007.03.15 -- Value, Arrogance, and Egoism

I always wonder why people call me arrogant. What is arrogance? And, what makes them think I am arrogant? First, we'll need the framework to understand how arrogance can exist:

I have come to the conclusion that value is simply that, value. Everything worth thinking about, worth pursuing at all, has value. Presumably people have value, most would say very high value. People have high value because of their free will, their ability to make moral choices. Of course, we don't &quot;assign&quot; value, that must be innate to the action, idea, or object. We might say that our free will &quot;creates the possibility of value&quot;. But, if we are really begging the question correctly, we must admit that value pre-exists us. Our moral/logic/value-based choices simply reveal the already present innate values of this world.

Other questions come to mind, specifically how we can judge the value of a person. Maybe you've heard people have infinite value (it's a nice phrase to say, it makes people feel good). But, clearly, we could all be &quot;better&quot; in some way, and thus we aren't of infinite value. In fact, we are clearly less than whatever our maximum possible value would be if we are not perfect.

What does &quot;better&quot; have to do with value? Morality is the root of value. They are synonymous. To say something is valuable is to say it is morally good, and vice versa. Remember: morality literally means, what one ought to pursue...that is exactly what we mean by value. To say something or someone is morally better is to say it is more valuable.

Take person A and B, identical in every way, except A is slightly better in value-variable X. The difference in value between A's variable X and B's variable X is essentially the only difference in value between A and B. We must conclude that it is possible that a person can be better or, more specifically, more valuable than another person.

This, of course, does not negate the -minimum- value of a person, as we'd all assume it would be reasonably high. But, we must make the distinction that some people are better than others. Most hate this idea. But, it is undeniable.

We have all been taught, by the post-modern world, that no person is better than another. We want to believe that all people are equal. They are not! Do you think any of us are as good (moral=value) as Jesus? What about the Apostle Paul? What about Mother Theresa? These people, in virtue of their massive moral contribution, are more valuable than we are. But, value also extends even further. What about Michael Jordan? If Basketball and skill in basketball is important (i.e. valuable) in any way, then someone identical to MJ, but lacking only in MJ's basketball skill, then MJ would be more valuable. Value is very hard assess, but clearly it exists and so do the differences in individual net worth.

So, now that you have a brief metaphysical foundation of valued-based thinking in the realm of personhood, we can move on to the real and fairly narrow topic of arrogance.

What is arrogance?

Despite what you may have heard:

Arrogance means thinking you have more value than you in fact have. A person who is arrogant overestimates their value.

Now, now, it would be quite easy for the post-moderns who think everyone is equal to call someone who believed that he or she was better than someone an arrogant person. In the illusionary world of post-modern equality, anyone who thinks they are better is clearly arrogant by definition. But, we know better, we aren't retarded. There are more valuable people than others in the world.

So am I arrogant? Do I overestimate my value?

Many people think so. It generally is said to me in the course of an argument. I defend a position they don't like, and I refuse to think otherwise. I Know they are wrong, and I'll say it. People don't like that. How dare I think I know the answer? How dare I discredit them, and believe my answer is better than theirs? How dare I think I have better answers altogether? How dare I think my brilliance is greater than theirs!

Lol.

I often feel I'm more valuable than others. Of course, I value myself, and especially see that my thoughts as extremely valuable. I see no reason why I wouldn't be (I'm not saying I can't be wrong, but there are only handful of people who have what I have). I see my faults, I see my strengths--both are weighed in evaluating self-worth. I know when I'm wrong, I know when I'm right. If I don't have an answer, then I don't have an answer. I don't claim to be the most valuable person...but I do see value in my opinion (of course I would, I'm just an egoist right?). I have value in virtue of my genius....self-created,Â  not entirely. But, I how I use my mind I am responsible for...

Mind you! Your value isn't wholly based on your decisions. God may not have created all people equal, and therefore he may not have created people with equal value. So what!~ Why are we repulsed by this? Is it the &quot;Democratic flaw&quot;...where we so much would not wish to be marginalized or be at the bottom of the food chain that we play it safe and say there is no up or down, and everyone is equal. Do you really think everyone has a right to vote? F-no. Do you really think everyone is equal? Of course you don't!!! You only say it so that, if and when you found yourself in an unfavorable position, you could defend yourself under the false pretense of equality.

Getting on with it, misassingment of ones purpose and role can be indicative of being arrogance. I know my purpose is to think. To teach, I don't know. I know where I fail, but I know my success. This is not arrogance.

Most ironic are people's attitudes towards what they perceive to be my arrogance. Now remember, arrogance means one thing:Â  People generally hate my so-called arrogance because they are offended by the thought that I am more valuable than they are...These are often the post-moderns who contradict themselves in assigning and understanding the meaning and application of value in this world. They say, &quot;nobody is worth more than anyone else&quot;. Clearly, this is patently false. Some people are worth more than others. In fact, we each have specific and certain value, some higher or lower than others. I claim I am more valuable than lots of people, often in virtue of simply having more valuable trains of thought. Either 1.) I am being magnanimous and truthful, or 2.) I'm being arrogant, or 3.) I am being meek, and fail to realize my full value.

So what if I claim that? So what if I think I'm right? Did they really sit down to evaluate these? No. The irony is that they are steadfast in their foolishness. The fool is arrogant.

It is evident they aren't as valuable as I am. Their very dislike, their hate for my truth stems from the belief that they are equal to me. They overestimate their value, and they are the one's who are arrogant. How foolish are these people to think their ideas could possibly compete with mine? They overvalue their opinions and themselves. Ah, don't we love the problem of egoism?

Moving on, this egoist/arrogance issue triggers a basic protective instinct in me. I see the world of fools around me, arrogant egoists, people who think their opinion matters as much, if not more than mine. I cannot argue with them, I fall prey to the same argument. &quot;Well, of course, Mike, you are an egoist too, of course you think you are correct.&quot; is all it takes to dismiss me. Why argue with them? Why teach them? Why teach the unteachable? Why should I be concerned with them if they are trash. I must shield my family from their foolishness. I have become completely intolerant of incompetance.

Pearls before Swine. They don't deserve it because they don't want it. If they sought the truth, then they deserve that truth. But, I will try anyways. If and When my family is not vulnerable, then I may be more tolerant. Don't get me wrong, I put up with stupid people all day. But, to allow them to influence me is a different matter. We are chosen among a world of pigs and fools. We must protect ourselves from their arrogance.
