title: McManus: Paranoia and the post-modern right

http://politicalcritique.org/world/2018/paranoia-and-the-post-modern-right/

<<<
The paranoia expressed by post-modern conservatives is often directed against a nefarious alliance bent on their destruction, an amorphous enemy against which they have no recourse.
<<<

I feel that paranoia against the ruling class. I think the problem is that conservatives can't point fingers where they really belong without contradicting themselves. 

<<<
The “big other” provides the individual with the standards of behaviour which should be followed, whether or not the individual consents consciously with them. 
<<<

I have no problem with calling [[The Moral Law]] or [[The Original Position]] that thing. 

<<<
Post-modern conservatives politically exploit this haunting anxiety, thereby fostering a paranoiac worldview. 
<<<

Why is your argument not just as paranoiac? Why don't I get to accuse you of a similar otherisation here? 

<<<
 They name and signify enemies, reinforcing anxiety over an absent or ambiguous otherness coherent identity—the elite caste, the mainstream media, radicals, and perhaps most unfortunately, immigrants, all of which form a unified conspiracy to liquidate “us.”
<<<

Maybe I've misunderstood you. If I haven't, then I think we have a problem here. Are you denying the elite caste is my enemy? Are you denying the mainstream media's abuse of power? Do you think the nazi's in my hometown aren't people to have anxiety over?

If you aren't paranoid, you're doing it wrong. 

<<<
The real problem is that the foreign “invader” threatens to reveal that our “big other,” the watchful guarantor of our mores and traditions, is a local construction. 
<<<

Of course, I agree to that!

<<<
The paranoiac worldview of post-modern conservatives is a reactionary defense against all things “other” due to the profound anxiety caused by the possibility that the world might be more complex than their psychic construction.
<<<

This is sweeping. You move too fast. Many post-modern conservatives are this. It's pretty clear that a large number of post-modern conservatives are exploiting this in others as well. Dark-triads, many of whom are post-modern conservatives, are creating and thriving in that chaos. Reactionary (or worse), yes. The motivation for that move isn't simply that anxiety though. 

<<<
To maintain the coherence of their worldview, post-modern conservatives transform the foreign/cosmopolitan/wealthy “others” into a unified enemy.
<<<

Agreed that oversimplifying is a mistake. 

<<<
As we have argued elsewhere, the basis of post-modern conservative arguments are not reality, but the hyper-reality of a culture war. 
<<<

Yup. Conclusion is fine with me.
