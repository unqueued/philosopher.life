!! How valuable is the NCCER test to you?

I'd spend another year pipefitting to pass it. Having the credential is valuable, it opens doors, and it finalizes my work. Ultimately, I think the electrician route makes the most sense, but I also have unfinished business here. This backup plan is worth having, I think. Being able to pipefit when I can't do electrician work is reasonable. Being a part of multiple unions would be nice. This is a great option (even if the pipefitter unions don't accept it directly).
