!! Audit:

* My kids are failing in school. But, am I failing as a parent at this point?
* Sore throats. What if they are allergic to cats?
* It's been a rough month for everyone, I think. 
* My wife writes a short letter to me each night, my children basically nothing in their wikis. I guess it's just me. You can't win 'em all, eh?
* Some of those compliments just sucked. Lol.
* We've done well with what we have.
