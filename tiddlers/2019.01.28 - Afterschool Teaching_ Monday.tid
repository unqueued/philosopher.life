title: 2019.01.28 - Afterschool Teaching: Monday

Whitney showed up very early. We did our paperwork. Food was set. 

I took the 5th and 6th, and Mitchell came by to sort through their lies with the actual materials from teh teachers who assigned the work. He took the hard kids this time (since he went by the book). I had a simple homework session. I can't say they did a great job, but they didn't do a terrible job.

I tried to explain the idea of a turing machine because none of my students would agree that my phone is a computer. They instantly stopped listening. Yup. I'm making learning fun!

We talked about the nature of farts for quite a while. This is a topic I'm interested in, of course, and I want to normalize bodily functions with the repressed children. Even the high schoolers joined in for this one.

Computer lab! Yay!

I don't know why my number was called an no one else got a call. I found out we didn't have school tomorrow first. Matt decided to announce it. That dude is a control freak ham, lol. He knows the value of being the one who delivers the publically agreed upon good sort of news.

Matt picks favorites based upon age and their future value to him in local status ladder climbing. He only picks the winners, and those are the only kids he spends any time investing himself personally. He talks about his social strategies in managing people, but this part he does not elaborate on.
