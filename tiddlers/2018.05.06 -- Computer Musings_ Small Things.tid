Back to seeding torrents of distros I'm using. 

LUSSH failed from m10 to m15. I do not understand why. I could dig, but I don't feel like it.

Setting up pip and pyperclip again on m15. I want to be able to do all of my logs out in the field if I can. The goal is to be completely free when I get home to cook and engage in family life.

Setup more audiobooks on m14. I want to push even harder!
