title: 2018.07.15 -- Jop: Walking

Jop talked about being about planning family time and walking with her husband. I encouraged her to walk everyday with her husband. Adult 1-on-1 time is crucial, and their children are just now old enough they can viably pull it off, imho. I know [[ALM]] will get home from work and desperately hope to vegg-out. He's not really living life if he's not spending at least a few minutes walking with his wife though. Family time is difficult, especially when they are young. I realize there is a great deal of stress in their lives.
