title: 2020.02.20 - Prompted Introspection: Chores Are For Plebs

!! Should you have to do chores around the house? Why or why not?

Does masturbation count as a chore? Sometimes, it can be. "C'mon you bastard: you can do it." If not, then the answer, surely, is an emphatic "no." Why the hell would a grown-ass manchild do anything in his own house? I don't owe anything to anyone, and everyone in the house exists to serve me. It's important to understand that chores are for plebs. I'm above that. Furthermore, if I had to do chores, then I would then be incentivized to maintain order (i.e. having some skin in the game), cleanliness, and make it easy on myself to do chores. Fuck that shit. My goal is to be a giant leech who is completely useless to anyone but himself.

I am an orchestrator of chores too. Principle-agent problem, I realize. I do run the household, [[WINTCIS]]. There's no way our family could survive (let alone thrive) without everyone pitching in. I have a lot of weight to carry around. I probably don't do a good enough job. Minimal effort, a functional threshold, and sanitation are goals, but I often have more important things to do that make it look purty (organization being a kind of functional aesthetic exception).
