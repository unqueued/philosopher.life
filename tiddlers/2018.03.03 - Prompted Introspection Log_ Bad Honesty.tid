title: 2018.03.03 - Prompted Introspection Log: Bad Honesty

!! When might it be bad to be honest?

I like this question. It's an important one to me. I make a classic distinction between //bad// and //wrong//. Insofar as honesty produces disutility for any set of agents, processes, or objects given any possible standard of the good (of any arbitrary thing) in their context, it is bad. Now, I have fully relativized, generalized, and particularized the concept of bad here, and thus I've provided the analytic definition of the badness of honesty. I'm not convinced I can give you a more correct answer without you giving me more content in your question.

I'll throw you a bone though, since your question is one few if any humans are in a position to answer thoroughly.

It's a bad thing when I hurt someone's feelings with my honesty. It's mostly bad for them, but it's bad for me too when I empathize with them. It can cause a ripple of bad effects in many relationships (not just social). We are now into the epistemic problematic territory of consequentialism. Pain and destruction are often results of honesty. 

Note, of course, I have not even talked about when honesty is "wrong," which may be implied by the question. I disagree with Kant when it comes to the categoricity of never lying. There are many tiers of dishonesty and deception. I will lie to the axe murderer at my doorstep. I believe I'm obligated to do so. There are many such cases, many which are not nearly as clearcut. I believe when I do so, I call upon the particularistic gods to judge me, as few can fully understand all of these kinds of exceptions. Objectivity becomes so important, and you certainly commit yourself to a risk in doing so. Unfortunately, risk taking is crucial to being moral. We must act without certainty. It's quite fuzzy to my dismay.
