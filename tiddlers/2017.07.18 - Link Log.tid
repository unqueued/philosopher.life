** Privatizing power is a bad thing. No shit, Sherlock. Power to the people.
** "Free market" just means letting the wealthy and powerful do whatever they want, no holds barred. Yeah, we should let them enslave us because...it's good for us all, right?

** Let me grant that most everyone know something about our world is fucked up. I am continually disappointed in what people point their fingers at and why.
** Trump's base continues to confabulate turn after turn.

** Never heard of Navarro, shows you how little I know. There's so much to keep track of.
** I assume this is one of the major sources of Trump's anti-trade deal policies, e.g. TPP.
*** I still am not sure how this ultimately profits Trump, at least not directly.
** I'm actually unsure what counts as a trade war. It seems obvious to me that we are already in one, and that this is really just a matter of escalation. Capitalism, especially in globalization, is ultimately a war amongst various powerful competing agencies who use and exploit the working class. It's mostly a war on the people as far as I can tell.

** So simple, so obvious, and clearly effective.

** Fascinating cryptocurrency exchange. Parts of this could work, but there seem to be serious problems. Chargebacks and other holes are serious issues. I don't know how to work around fiat currencies like that without trust building that can still eventually be exploited.

** A demon that has never entranced me, at least not yet.
** Unfortunately, Rand may be ever correct in some of her assessments of the description of mankind, but I cannot buy her prescription.

*** Nothing new. But, yeah, with few exceptions in the US, fuck those who make money off dying and sick people.

*** Let's be clear: it was easy to vote to repeal Obamacare when it couldn't happen, as it was a symbolic act. Those who do not now just show their true colors: free political points with voters. The worst part is that these people are the best of the Republicans, since they at least have a modicum (however small) of compassion. Let that sink in.
