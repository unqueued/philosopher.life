* Disconfirm My Bias

*** They aren't as smart as I'd have hoped somedays. 

* Think About It

*** My concern is that I am considered a conspiracy theorist by the ever civil "centrists" (including this rag).

*** Like sex toys, I'm looking forward to it.

*** Possibly. I think there's still far more to the story in our lizard brains.
** https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/02/academic-grievance-studies-and-the-corruption-of-scholarship/
*** Sneaky devils. Of course, that doesn't make everything these people say wrong. I regularly defend the extreme right on some particular points as well (though, less commonly). 

* Fishy
** https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-systematically-pries-technology-from-u-s-companies-1537972066
*** Sounds like a realpolitik attack here. Guess who favors IP? KYS.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/10/social-media-battlefield-internet/571960/
*** ROFL. Memetic warfare is totally real. Our own governments use them against us. Security must be open and decentralized. If you think censorship is the notion (one person hindering another from accessing information), you've already fucked up.
