Have a wonderful day today. Mine will be wet and rainy. It’s 50 outside now and will be 35 by the time I head home.

Wet out here, but not that cold (hopefully). I hope it will be safe traveling too. I do not like driving in that (though, I suppose I'll need to get used to it).

Halloween seems like it would be a great holiday for you (it's [[k0sh3k]]'s favorite). You have any plans?
THU 9:41 AM
Homework. :/ when I was younger Halloween was a month long celebration for me. But I just couldn’t find the time this year. Not even today.

I would be tempted to go as the student not doing his homework as my Halloween costume.

They do trick-or-treating in your area?
THU 9:47 AM
Seems to be dying around here.
THU 9:47 AM
Hahahaha
I’m not really sure tbh. It monsooned last year and it’s doing the same today. We have candy but I expect we’ll be the ones munching. I don’t even think kids live in our building.
