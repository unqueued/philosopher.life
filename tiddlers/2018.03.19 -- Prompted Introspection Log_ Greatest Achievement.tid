title: 2018.03.19 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Greatest Achievement

!! What do you consider your greatest achievement?

Ouch. I have nothing I'm all that proud of at the moment. I was kind of hoping that my greatest achievement is something in my future. This wiki, might be my future achievement (or better).

Pressed to it, I feel accomplished in finding some method to stabilize myself after a long existential crisis-spiral. I've been fighting uphill on a number of fronts, and I'm proud of the fact that I'm still alive to write this sentence. I'm grateful to myself for mitigating (if not overcoming) an obstacle-beast that few seem to wrestle with (and fewer can articulate). I'm happy to see that my family is making more sense, moving forward, and that each year appears to be getting better. I have more hope, somehow, than I did before. I suppose [[h0p3]] really is my achievement.
