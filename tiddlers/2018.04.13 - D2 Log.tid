Well, the sorc can farm Nith, but it's quite unfun. I've not trivialized the encounter. At this point, it doesn't matter. I need rune and socketed items. I'm going to farm The Hole on my paladin now. I don't have engima, but Vigor and the Staff TP on weaponswap buys me plenty of mobility. He can very quickly clear on /players 3, although his survability is not what I want it to be.

I'm purposely wearing 0% MF on him because I want to maximize my speed and pickup the pieces I really, really need. Runes, eth and socket items, and I suppose gems.

Also, I went for it. I built HOTO. If I'm going to grind on him for 30 hours, might as well make it pleasant. HOTO is +3 Skills, which is really the only reason I prefer it. I have +3 Combat skill +20FCR circlet to hit the 125% FCR breakpoint. 11k hammers are fairly strong. My Druid is going to love the HOTO as well, hell, so will the necro, who can concede 2-3 skill points in mastery to pickup 37 to resists, and the FCR is noice too. Basically, I'm going to work my way up to having melee.

It's ironic. The only characters I have that can take down Ubers and Clone are essentially absolute bonkers budget CB-abusers. I pour everything into my casters though. They are the runners. 

The Hammerdin's primary build is completed by level 80, at least as I build it (and with the gear I have). Increasing levels ultimately means higher HP (higher block rate from HS means less dex, more stam; also stam from levels; hp from levels) and better defense (level based advantage; HS increase).
