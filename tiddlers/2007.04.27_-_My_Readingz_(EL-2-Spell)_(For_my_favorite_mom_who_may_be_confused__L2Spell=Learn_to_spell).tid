title: 2007.04.27 - My Readingz (EL-2-Spell) (For my favorite mom who may be confused: L2Spell=Learn to spell)

So, I've had the opportunity (I.E. free time at work) to do some reading. And, on top of everything I always read on the interweb while in the Ville of Louis, in the past couple weeks I've read actual words on paper, including:

6 of 6 Harry Potter series (7th book is coming next month, be prepared!)
'Manufacturing Consent'
Some of 'Anna Karenina'
'This is Your Brain on Music'
C.S. Lewis's Space/Sci-Fi Trilogy

Nothing much to say about the Harry Potter series. I mean, I've read them before, and I'm just prepping myself again for the final book (hard to keep that much storyline in your head all at once). Although, I must say that after a 4th time reading through, I am struggling with the underlying presence of relativistic thought in this book. The struggle between good and evil amounts to something less meaningful in these books. It is apparent in the last part of the series that &quot;love&quot; conquers all, and our enemy is &quot;fear&quot;. Oh, please--Donnie Darko again? I am now having to think about when I would let my child read these stories.

'Manufacturing Consent' was simply fantastic. Noam Chomsky has created a masterpiece essay. 1/3rd of the book is introductory thesis. The stuff in the middle is highly relevant and exhaustive support for his thesis, which is maintained by the last third of this book: pure citation. This book was made in 1988, and it reads like a book attacking our world today. Superb book.

'Anna Karenina' is a loathsome book. Don't read it, please.

'This is Your Brain on Music' is a book by a neuro-bio-physio-psychologist with a few extra PHD's and a wealth of experience in all things music. It is seriously a good read. He dives very deeply into the brain, the mind, other biological functions, and how music interacts with these objects. I found it to be thrilling.

C.S. Lewis's Space Trilogy was...different. 'Out of the Silent Planet' was the first book. It honestly hinted at moral relativism and Darwinian thought. It was decent sci-fi, but we were left more confused than when we started by the end of the book. Wonderfully, the first book is resolved and completed in 'Perelandra' (the 2nd book). The second book was by far the best of the series. It was obvious C.S. Lewis writing. Only he can make you read a story that you would have been unwilling to read if you had only known what C.S. Lewis was writing about in the first place. I am certainly glad I did read it though. The 2nd book is a fascinating account of the fall. Every 40 or 50 pages, you'll find the few paragraphs that he has been working towards for the entire book, and you will be astounded by the astute insight he has in store for us. And, frankly, C.S. Lewis's genius was that he could put immensely complex theological ideas into fun, tightly composed sentences and allegories. He does not fail us in the second book. The third book, yes, he fails. My wife didn't like it because it was &quot;sexist&quot; (which it wasn't blatantly). I just thought it was a poor resolution to the story. He should have stuck with the 2nd book, and left it at that.

And, I'm starting in on Flannery O'Conner's short stories (Epiphanautic Grim Allegorical Southern Gothic Protestocatholic Overly-Symbollic Existential Revelatory literature with a pinch of Egalitarianism, and probably too much detail that we are supposed to glean &quot;deep meaning&quot; from...). You know what, these stories put me in such a good mood. I am inspired to glance off the pages of Mz. Flanz stories, to look up and observe the finer qualities of &quot;humanity&quot; in my co-workers. ROFL. Oh, and I'll define the odd word for you. Epiphanautic is an adjective that refers to sailing or navigating in a metaphorical sea of epiphanies (generally, if there is a sea of them, then you are hallucinating--you just think you are receiving an inundation of divine manifestations of wisdom and insight). Please savor this word. Yes, it is very good.
