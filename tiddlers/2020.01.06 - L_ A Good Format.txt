[8:14 PM] Sohalia: Something to add to my list of favorite pass times: narrating a game of Secret Hitler for drunk people
[8:15 PM] Sohalia: 11/10 would do again.
[10:56 AM] h0p3: Lol
[10:57 AM] h0p3: Some games are straight up better while inebriated too, imho.
[1:20 PM] Sohalia: Trying to get that group to play a game was like herding cats :laughing:
[1:22 PM] Sohalia: It was enjoyable though, in a “live for the chaos” sorta way.
[10:39 PM] Sohalia: Now I’m just poking you
[10:39 PM] Sohalia: Remind me: do you all put up a Christmas tree? I can’t remember for sure.
[10:40 PM] h0p3: We haven't in a long time. Not opposed to it directly, but don't see the point.
[10:40 PM] Sohalia: Gotcha
[10:41 PM] h0p3: This year it was completely thrown off. We worked on xmas, though we got to go out for our Mexican meal (which was awesome).
[10:41 PM] Sohalia: I ask because one of the crafts I know how to make is to use crayons to make glass* ornaments >_>
[10:41 PM] Sohalia: Ew. Well I’m glad you all got to come chill with us for a bit then.
[10:43 PM] h0p3: Yeah, me too. We had a great time.
[10:44 PM] h0p3: I think you and [[K]] were a special kind of glue for the vacation. You made it smooth logistically and socially.
[10:46 PM] h0p3: You have a talent for weaving together the various preferences of the people around you into something coherently unified.
[10:46 PM] Sohalia: Aw, thank you!
[10:47 PM] Sohalia: I think we have somehow managed to become hosts on the regular, and that just causes us to naturally look out for the people around us.
[10:48 PM] h0p3: Aye. I can see that. You know how to generate the pleasantness of effective social gatherings. Seems like half of it is intuition, and the other half a labor of love.
[10:49 PM] h0p3: I can't reverse engineer it fast enough to plan for such a thing, but I feel like I can recognize at least parts of it play out around me.
[10:49 PM] h0p3: Hopefully, we'll get to meet for vacation again.
[10:50 PM] h0p3: Maybe in a year or two (I don't know how schedules work out); hopefully, our lives will be more simplified. I think December was a particularly odd month for most of the people there, lol.
[10:52 PM] Sohalia: Agreed — it was unexpectedly good. I think giving us all a chance to have our own space but still have a common room was the best thing we could have had. Most of us are “let’s sit near each other and enjoy each other’s presence” types of people, so this was a good format.
[10:53 PM] Sohalia: I say unexpectedly because I wasn’t totally sure how sane I would remain being with my family for that long XD it’s been a long time since I lived in the same space with them like that.
[10:55 PM] Sohalia: You all are easy to hang around though. You’ll eat anything (or make yourself something if you can’t), you enjoy board games and quirky videos, and you’re always content to just exist. It’s always a super chill experience, and I love it.
[10:56 PM] Sohalia: It’s very low mental emotional effort to hang out with you all, sprinkled with goofy memories and spontaneously serious conversations.
[10:57 PM] Sohalia: I had to correct that last bit because you make me think too much for it to be low mental effort. But the emotional effort is definitely low, in the best of ways.
[10:58 PM] Sohalia: ╰(´︶`)╯♡
[11:14 PM] h0p3: :heart:
[11:16 PM] h0p3: Also, you guys will enjoy it up here. No carpet, room to yourself, air mattress is great, and we're in the city (and in short traveling distance of big ones) in case there was something you wanted to do up here.
