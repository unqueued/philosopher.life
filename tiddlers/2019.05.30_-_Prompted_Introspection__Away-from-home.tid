title: 2019.05.30 - Prompted Introspection: Away-from-home

!! Tell about one of your first away-from-home experiences.

I'm fairly sure most of my first experiences occurred before I had any persistent memory. I was forced to go to summer camp at Camp Loucon. I have learned I have no business being with or around most people from a young age. It's not like I don't want to be with people, but it's clear we don't belong together. I'm a slow learner. They really do hate autistic people, and I'm tired of dealing with it; it has warped me into an anti-social misfit. The near contradiction of [[loving|love]] [[Humanity]] and despising most homo sapiens torments me.

I am, of course, grateful to have escaped some of the hellish aspects of my home, to see how other kids had it, and to expand my [[phenomenology]]. I did have a good time in many activities at the camp even if the people generally didn't care for me. It was valuable to have away-from-home experiences, and I've known that since I was fairly young (it was also dictated to me). 

My brother is going to take my offspring for a week or two starting July 6th. I hope it will be a valuable experience for them, and I think they are going to have a great time. I think it might also be a useful and fun experience for my brother and Rebecca. I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself in that timeframe. I think I'll be walking around my house naked though.
