title: 2018.03.18 -- Carpe Diem Log: Filled

* Woke at 6
** I had a vivid dream where I was erect and pissing in imaginary, elaborate, Cubist, open, co-ed bathrooms in various schools I've attended, humiliated as I was pissing everywhere and grossing people out. Of course, I woke up needing to pee.
** I tried going back to sleep, but I couldn't. 
* Talked with wife until she and the kids left for church
* Read+Write
* Tried setting up IRS plan again, but technical difficulties on their end.
* Send a message to L. I actually have sent many. She just elects not to answer. I wonder if she will eventually figure out that she's rude about it. Her ability to comparmentalize socialization is very interesting (and I say that as an autist).
* Called AIR
* Talked to JRE
* Bliss
* LCS highlights
* Read+Write
* Inform the Men!
** Passed out. Woke up a few minutes later after refractory period, and voila, Fireman Time!
* Family Meeting
** This went better than I expected.
* Pancakes made in bacon grease are like funnel cakes. Very good.
** Berries, bacon, and honey.
* Westworld
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Bed by 12:30, Venture
