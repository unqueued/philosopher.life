!! Fahrenheit 451

My answer to any bullshit. 

I'm so opposed to censorship it makes those around me sick. My thesis defense went poorly when I explained that meant I aimed to build and support networks which enable and protect everything, including literal (not simply depictions or art of) child pornography. I'm not opposed to silencing my enemies when it is justified, 

!! [[Tao Te Ching]]

[[Gary]] will know what it do. 

!! Upanishads

Slim fucking pickings, and we've gotten rid of 90% of our library (especially anything I can find a digital copy of). Blew our remaining credit a bit more to pick up a few.

!! The Bible

Oversized. Wake up. Get rustled.

!! Quran 

The one I know they are gunning for. I know they don't even know their Bible, let alone other scriptures.

!! Atlas Shrugged

My enemies. I won't burn your books (except for this art piece), but those who apply the principles have forfeited their lives.

!! The US Constitution 

Thank you, ACLU. Sorry. I know you'd approve. Not like any of these assholes are going to have a serious conversation about how to rewrite the sumbitch.
