title: 2018.08.13 -- AIR: Long Talk

My brother called me like promised. He wanted to go through my wiki with me in person, so we did. We went over the letter to AA&UJ, L&K, and [[Find The Others]]. He gets what I'm doing, and I really appreciate it. He wants me to find a good laptop for him too. So, I'll be checking for him. He wants something on Thursday.

He says he is going to visit! I hope he does.
