title: Wittlux the Timewalker

* Abilities
** Force Kite -- At-Will
*** Deal direct damage to target, and the target is randomly snared (slows movement speed) or knocked back a considerable distance away from me.
** Levitate -- At-Will
*** Cause target object neither larger nor heavier than myself to levitate up to 5 feet higher from its previous position. The target naturally floats down slowly over the course of 1 minute.
** Time Stop -- Daily Type
*** Time stops for everything except me for 10 seconds. I can reposition myself (including my gear), but I can't move anything else. No one besides myself perceives what goes on in these 10 seconds.
** Enthrall -- Conditional Type
*** If I can see my target's eyes, I can choose to hold myself and my target mesmerized. We take no actions and we do not move. 
*** The effect is broken if either my sight of their eyes is broken or whenever one of us takes damage. Otherwise, I can break the effect at any time.
** Frozen Guard -- Innate Type
*** All damage against me has a chance to stun my attacker.
*** Stunned targets are unable to act or move, and damage does not break the effect.
