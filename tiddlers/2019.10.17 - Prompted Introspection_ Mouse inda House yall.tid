title: 2019.10.17 - Prompted Introspection: Mouse inda House yall

!! If you were a mouse in your house in the evening, what would you see your family doing?

At least one person is munching on something, at least one cat is in someone's lap, at least one person is using a keyboard to control a computer, there's a 3% chance someone is dropping some dank maymay or zing, there's a 5% chance I'm blathering, there's a 10% chance someone is walking in the living room, there's 70% chance my offspring aren't doing their work, and there's probably music playing (in which case my wife has a book) in the background unless there's a show. We're all probably half-reading something. Chairman Meow and I may be crowding [[k0sh3k]].

Problematically, for the mouse, our cats hunt mice. So, all the humans would be watching and talking about what the cats are doing. If they are overly alert, we aim to understand why. If our cats are working together, we have reason to believe something is there. The mouse in our house would be targeted by 6 mammals. The cats aim to destroy it, and the humans aim to find a way to release it outside in such a way that the cats can't get to it.
