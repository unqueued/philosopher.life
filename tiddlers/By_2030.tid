I found a reason to live: my children's happiness. Once their happiness is secured, I really don't want to exist. Now, it would make them sad for me to die, but they can live fulfilling and happy lives without me. I just have to get them there. Afterwards, I will have earned the right to end my life. That is my intention (barring the possibility that I find other reasons to live). I'm hoping that after 13 years, I can generate sufficiently good lives for my children (assuming the world doesn't end before that time) and take my life. I have a goal. I can do it. Now I must plan and work hard to reach it.

To be clear, suicide can be a method of empathizing with yourself. It depends on your positon/context. Sometimes ending your life just is maximizing your utility. For some of us, it's the best marred life you can achieve.

The conditions aren't clear. I should set those out.
