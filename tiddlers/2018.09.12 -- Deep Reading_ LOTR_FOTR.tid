title: 2018.09.12 -- Deep Reading: LOTR:FOTR

Why doesn't Aragorn take the ring? The ring's "pull" makes no sense.

The Hobbit has one wild thing after another. FOTR is largely mundane, and it slowly builds up across the series. It's that classic arc.

I'm not sure the children are loving this. They loved The Hobbit. Should we wait to do LOTR? Will the end be awesome enough to them? I don't want to waste their first reading.
