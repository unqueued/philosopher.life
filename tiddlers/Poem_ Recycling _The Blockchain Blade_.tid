title: Poem: Recycling "The Blockchain Blade"

```
When you were partying, I studied my wiki. 

When you were having premarital sex, I mastered myself.

While you wasted your days at the gym in pursuit of vanity, I cultivated inner strength. 

And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate, you have the audacity to come to me for help.
