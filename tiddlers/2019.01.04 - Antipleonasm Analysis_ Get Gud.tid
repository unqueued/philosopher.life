One could always interpret this in a better light. Draper's quotes have just the right [[dok]] of ambiguity to buy you innocuous, generous, and even positive perspectives if you seek to worship him.

I feel like I'm listening to [[Ayn Rand]] coach me gently. Draper, IIRC, is an equal opportunity exploiter in this quote. I can appreciate instances in which "it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission" is moral, but that's not anything like what Draper has in mind. He really does just take it. He fundamentally never gives a shit. Even this "advice" is in service to him, rofl. KYS, asshole.
