Lol.

 I feel terrible. And right at the same time.  I cannot make sense of this life. I have put my time in education both academic and trade school to find unhappiness lies at each. I think you know this problem too well.

Yeah, god damn, I hear that.

I yearn for a day where I feel safe, comfortable, and satisfied. I'm tired of being lost, searching for a place in the world.
