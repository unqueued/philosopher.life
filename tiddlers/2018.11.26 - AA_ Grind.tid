I am sleepy and hoping for snow days but otherwise very happy to be mathing my way through the day!

Do you have a particular class you enjoy teaching more than the others?
MON 1:30 PM
My last hour 8th graders —they are really bright and eager to learn
MON 1:31 PM
Exceptionally easy to teach
MON 1:31 PM
Willing students are the best
MON 1:31 PM
But all of my classes are pretty good
MON 1:31 PM
Last hour is usually the hardest but they are great!
MON 1:32 PM
How has your day been?
MON 1:34 PM
Productive enough. Like pulling teeth to get the children to write their work in their wikis unless it is computer science.
MON 1:35 PM
Called about the doing the paperwork for the job. I do that tomorrow.
MON 1:36 PM
Setup a server in Dallas as our VPS.

Woot!

Sounds good —are you happy with the job?

yeah, I can respect it and look at myself in the mirror at the end of day. We'll see once I actually get there
MON 1:37 PM
not a living wage
MON 1:37 PM
