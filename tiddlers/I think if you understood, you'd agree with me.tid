title: I think if you understood, you'd agree with me

What the fuck does that mean?

I do think there is a lack of empathy for my position. Rightfully so. I'm autistic (I have a different kind of social programming altogether) and I'm intelligent. That is going to make my brain different (that isn't a value judgment; I mean it in the sense of "deviance from the norm" any value attached), and it is going to make my mind seem really off to other people. I can't expect them to understand (although, by that same token, I'm not convinced they should always expect me to understand them either).
