* Inspection for SUV
* DMV
** Birth cert, marriage license, insurance proof, proof of residence, titles (hoping to get by without bill of sale), inspection for SUV (car doesn't need for another year).
* If I have a legal vehicle, then we won't shop. I can do that on Monday. I'd prefer not to monopolize her time.
* Date?
* Complete our room. 
** I'd like her to be happy. One more push should put us into the butterzone.
* Cat area needs to be done, tremendously.
* Perhaps [[m12]]?
* You obviously aren't getting enough sleep. Hours don't dictate it.
* If modem comes in, attempt to redo the networking. Hopefully, we can have something finalized.
** Need to turn in the modem/router early too. No reason to be charged.
