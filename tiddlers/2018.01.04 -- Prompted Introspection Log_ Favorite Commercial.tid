title: 2018.01.04 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Commercial

!! Do you like commercials? Tell about your favorite commercial.

I have seen a wide variety. I grew up on a steady diet of that bullshit. Of course, they are designed to hold my attention. I find myself naturally drawn to it. I must hold myself back. I purposely avert my gaze. I turn it off. I block it zealously. I consider it a form of coercion and mind-control. I think this is part of how humans use each other as mere means. Fuck that shit.
