Week was boring. Staying in hotel. Kiddo is gone for the weekend shopping with her aunt.

But I did come across a very cool letter on my PC. "unspent letter to [[REDACTED]]." my best friend from Hs.

How are you and how is your weekend plans?

I'm sorry the week was boring. Hotel does not sound as fun. Crashpad soon enough though!

I bet she had a blast with her aunt.

Very cool to find a letter to your friend.

I bet you will have more time on your PC while staying in Berea, and more time just in general (hopefully more sleep too)

I am back in Berea tonight. Bought another commuter car. And back at the cheapo hotel. Has TV internet and heater.

Weekend flew by. We didn't have kiddo so had fun. But I stay up late and slept in. Lol.

We drove to Eastern ky to buy me a new commuter car.
Dec 15, 2019 7:47pm
Delicious. Nice to have a break from the kiddo.
Dec 15, 2019 7:47pm
You like your new commuter?
Dec 15, 2019 7:48pm
I literally just got another honda very similar to the last two. Lol.

However, this one has some upgrades.
