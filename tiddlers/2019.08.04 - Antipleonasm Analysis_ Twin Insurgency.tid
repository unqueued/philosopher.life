title: 2019.08.04 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Twin Insurgency

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
States within the global political economy today face a twin insurgency, one from below, another from above. From below comes a series of interconnected criminal insurgencies in which the global disenfranchised resist, coopt, and route around states as they seek ways to empower and enrich themselves in the shadows of the global economy. Drug cartels, human traffickers, computer hackers, counterfeiters, arms dealers, and others exploit the loopholes, exceptions, and failures of governance institutions to build global commercial empires. These empires then deploy their resources to corrupt, coopt, or challenge incumbent political actors.

From above comes the plutocratic insurgency, in which globalized elites seek to disengage from traditional national obligations and responsibilities. From libertarian activists to tax-haven lawyers to currency speculators to mineral-extraction magnates, the new global super-rich and their hired help are waging a broad-based campaign to limit the reach and capacity of government tax-collectors and regulators, or to manipulate these functions as a tool in their own cut-throat business competition.

Unlike classic 20th-century insurgents, who sought control over the state apparatus in order to implement social reforms, criminal and plutocratic insurgents do not seek to take over the state. Nor do they wish to destroy the state, since they rely parasitically on it to provide the legacy goods of social welfare: health, education, infrastructure, and so on. Rather, their aim is simpler: to carve out de facto zones of autonomy for themselves by crippling the stateâ€™s ability to constrain their freedom of (economic) action.

I grant that many criminals are immoral, and I grant that even the insurgency from below is real to a non-trivial degree. I will not agree that all criminals named in this insurgency are immoral though! It is surprising not to see this caveat to this headline, and that is a redflag. More importantly, they are not equal insurgencies; this comes off as lacking honesty. Plutocrats own the state, and they are simply far more effective criminals than those from below. It's not blue-collar vs. white-collar; there's a gold-collar. The insurgency from below is a bogeyman and a red herring which misdirects us from the primary force behind the problems we face (and that's no accident).

The last paragraph, however, looks to the past like we didn't have this problem before. No, the elite have simply better understood what it means to harness the state and the proletariat. The general argument, however, is still correct!
