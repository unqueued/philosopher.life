title: 1st Class Translation Services Embedded in Linux Ecosystems

I just had a conversation with my Thai friend, [[Jop]] using Google translate. I'm able to break down my complex English sentences down into simpler atomic sentences which have a higher translation accuracy rate. This is important to me. I want to be able to converse with, understand, and explore the non-English speaking world through automated tools. I need to automate some semblance of a "reading level" kind of fluency into my computing systems. 

* My browser should open me up to exploring the non-English web like I never have before.
* My messengers should make it very easy to connect with others.
* Privacy and Anonymity cannot be had at the moment. The only tools available are proprietary and centralized.

In the end, in trying to [[Find The Others]], I'm going to need to branch out to non-native English speakers to some extent. Admittedly, I think my wiki may be one of the hardest objects to translate I've ever seen. Even native English speakers seem to have a very hard time understanding it.
