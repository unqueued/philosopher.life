title: 2010.10.05 - A Problem in Typological Thought

 Okrent believes goal attributions are best understood in population-based thinking rather than typological-based thinking.1 While I’m not sure if he has a valid framework or an adequate account of population-based thinking for his conception of intentionality, I think he is wise to define the normativity of goals outside of typological thinking.

Typological thought initially seems a natural fit for Okrent’s account of intentionality. When considering the norms of a wasp, we are drawn to ‘waspness’. Whatever might be essential to being a wasp is the standard by which a particular wasp would be judged. To say a wasp is a ‘good’ wasp is simply to say that it matches the essential features of the archetype of wasp; the good wasp is to act, behave, and ‘dance’2 as the archetype of wasp characteristically does. To say a particular feature of an individual wasp is ‘bad’ is to say that it doesn’t match the typical feature of this archetype of wasp.

In my opinion, the normativity of Okrent’s account of intentionality will quickly run into problems with this typological framework. From a typological framework, how does one account for beneficial evolution? Arguably the fathers of typological categorization, Plato and Aristotle certainly couldn’t account for evolution. They would have considered it an asinine concept; as Greek essentialists, they saw the definitions of species as eternal and unchanging.

The issue of beneficial evolution (or even a series of mutations that eventually arrive at something beneficial) is quite alien to typological thought. Notice that some aspects of the archetypal ‘wasp’ in the end aren’t beneficial to wasps as living things. To improve upon the ‘wasp’ archetype is to be talking about something which isn’t wasp-like anymore. Beneficial evolution is awkward here – it seems as if it ‘beneficial’ to the flourishing of the living thing, but typological normativity would deem any mutation of a particular wasp as ‘unwasplike’ and ‘bad’. So, it seems as if we wish to employ two standards of normativity:

    The virtue of being a wasp.

    The virtue of being a living thing.

Typological normativity demonstrates that a good ‘wasp’ is aligned to the characteristics of the eternal form and archetype of ‘waspness’. The identity and definition of ‘wasp’ is unchanging in typological thought. It seems as if typological normativity of ‘living things’ is different from ‘waspness’. For example, we might want to say that every living thing should be evolving, adapting, and progressing towards whatever is the perfect life form (at least in a selfish perspective, perhaps hoping for the status quo of the ecosystem, but the goal was to be at the top of the food-chain).

Insofar as the essential features of a ‘wasp’ might not be as good as they could be (after mutation) or don’t lead to flourishing, it seems as if ‘waspness’ isn’t a good thing according to the ‘living thing’ standard. We can see contradictory standards of normativity where beneficial mutations or beneficial adjustments in behavior would be a good thing for the sake of a living thing’s ‘goal’ to flourish, but simultaneously a ‘bad’ thing because it doesn’t align with the f-ness of a particular species.

By avoiding typological normativity, Okrent seems to bypass any contradictions of the normativity of both flourishing qua ‘waspness’ and flourishing qua ‘living thing’. Taking population-based thought and evolution as being central to developing the normative standards of species seems much more plausible.
