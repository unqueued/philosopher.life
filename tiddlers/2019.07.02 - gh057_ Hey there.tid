title: 2019.07.02 - gh057: Hey there

h0p3,

Hey there sir! I hope this finds you well tonite. I tried to use the name you gave me but it was already taken. I did use a variation that I hope will work. Still at the school, looks like the better part of another week. Its been an event. Dave and I are basically working for free because he only got a week and I 2 weeks pay so after the first week of June for Dave and 2nd week of June for me, we are working for free...crazy i know but i cant help but want to finish this.  Maybe better planning by us will help next year. I continue to read your Wiki daily as best as time allows. It still is a great read and i appreciate how you have taken so much time to log your life as you do. That is brilliant and so wonderful. A legacy left for others . Thats some great stuff there. We would love to come over sometime. I have a trip the week of the 15th of July but hopefully we can work something out between our schedules. Thanks for being a friend and bless you and your family. I hope all is well and thriving. 

Best wishes
