!! Audit:

* This log has transformed into something I don't dread.
** I'm going to keep saying it: thank you for the model, [[Sphygmus]].
** I look forward to doing this one, even with the icky.
* Not giving too much a shit about whether or not I'm going to accomplish it when I write it helps. 
* It's less quant and more qual. Feels so much more like {[[Dreams]]}.
* Even if I don't do it on the spot, I've at least made some inroads into planning it for when I do.
* I think there's less of the mundane in here.
* I'm grateful we had some days off together. That doesn't happen as much as I'd like.
* Will I get to the point where I listen to myself, use a calender, etc? 
** ROFL. Naw. 
* We clearly need that refund. =/
