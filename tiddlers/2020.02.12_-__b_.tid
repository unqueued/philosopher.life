That type of hypothetical line of reasoning (used in the [[CI]]) which goes something like, "what if there X number of people like this in the world?", has been on my mind. I think if there were a million of me (heaven forbid), I think I would have a surprisingly good chance of my clones and I finding each other. Strict biodeterminism is hilarious, but twin studies are not nothing. Odds are very good my clones would be autistic neckbeards living on their computers, and surely they would accidentally find each other in many cases (though I doubt I would get along with myself), and that is despite the fact that I tend to be a profound lurker (it is rare that I make accounts, often taking many years). Hard to tell with my upbringing.

That is another favorite part of my wiki: I have a space to be myself, and normally, I'm heavily punished for that. I've learned not to talk unless the person demonstrates more than a fleeting interest. You have to go out of your way to speak with me (and you have to go out of your way to find me too). I wonder how that would play out amongst my clones.
