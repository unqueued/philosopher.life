I have always preferred...[reflecting on life]...to life itself. 

-- Francois Truffaut
<<<

Here I examine my life and exercise my [[Know Thyself]] axiom by coercively dissecting myself in vanilla staged dialectics. This is almost too obvious a form of self-examination, but I [[hope]] not to be shallow about it. I must force myself to articulate my beliefs and desires (which are in fact highly constitutive of my [[4DID]]), and this log does exactly that (including the bad, wrong, and ugly). Here I answer generic existential questions which pull my identity onto the pages of this wiki. 

Sometimes I feel like I need a can-opener to pry myself open. Writing prompts force me to say something about a topic and to explore myself. I try to ask personal or philosophical questions, but sometimes they can be so generic they allow me to say whatever I want to say. Admittedly, some of my responses are humorous and recreational, but I still attempt to provide something useful. Sometimes I sprawl all over the place, and I can be prone to ask more questions than I answer. I'm fond of pointing out the lack of definitions and context. I often give non-answers (you suck, question/er!) as well. That's okay though. This is just part of the mind-mapping process.

It is my hypothesis that many of the prompts are lame "Sunday School" questions. The teacher might gather us together and ask generic existential questions; we'd have to formulate intelligent appearing and socially acceptable responses. It was a form of conditioning. We were expected to think as they did. My questions and answers were often received poorly, dismissed, or misunderstood: par for the course. Graduate school in philosophy had better reasons for their tribalisms, but even that could sometimes be too suffocatingly narrow and impersonal at times (especially since it didn't encourage systematic philosophy).

Thankfully, here I get to say whatever I think since I'm answering the questions for myself. I'm brutally honest, and I appreciate having the chance to avoid social desirability bias; preference falsification is antithetical to my goal. I won't always pretend I'm the one asking the questions though. A dialectic, like the Socratic method, tends to bring out the best in me. Sometimes I'm just talking to myself directly. Other times, I have a more adversarial approach to these prompts as I verbally spar with my imaginary friends. As crazy as it may seem, it's been useful for me to interpret at least some of these questions as coming from another person. I currently wrestle with three interlocutors.

Samwise Gamgee is Tolkienian humanity; he is my mortal enemy, that eternal asshole, may he burn in hell.<<ref "1">> Hostility allows my guttural instincts to take over, to let loose, to fly, and once in a while it is even a useful way for me to force myself to answer carefully, to pick apart everything, to see the outlines. In many ways, I was good at academic philosophy because I was at mental war.<<ref "3">> Samwise the Fool has us covered here. I'm happy to dismiss or destroy him.

Lady Melisandre is a goddess. Imagine if Jessica Rabbit starred in the Lord of the Rings (share_the_load); she grants me wishes and serves me here when I want to be explicit (:P) because I care about my audience's feelings and needs, even if only out of self-interest.<<ref "2">> Attempting to be  charitable to my audience's character, playfully taking their questions seriously, and seeking their instinctual approval can also be useful. Lady Melisandre has me covered here.<<ref "4">>

Diogenesocrates is The Hybrid Prophet and the teacher I respect. I look up to this overidealized iconic hero; those are the shoulders upon which I hope to one day stand. I hope to humbly live up to him in our dialectic. I found I was good at this approach in academic philosophy as well (to a point). May my Straussian charity and self-doubt serve me well.

Guided by simple questions and prompts not of my choosing, I hope to model myself to myself even in the mundane. I either hope to crystallize [[diamonds]] or be forced to start giving different answers to the same questions and move towards the [[irwartfrr]] means to achieve my ends via [[redpills]].

!! Principles:

* "!!" the prompt to make it stand out, then answer it.
* Reference your wiki, use [[hlexicon]], and give yourself examples.
* Answer questions sequentially from [[Generic Prompts]] and respond to previous answers.
* When you prefer, respond to one of your interlocutors: Samwise Gamgee, Lady Melisandre, or Diogenesocrates.

!! Dreams:

* Eventually, I want to have this process automated. It might remove some bias. Until then, go blindly fish.
** Automatically linking together previous answers would be a godsend.
* Eliminating redundancy and crystallizing the set of questions may be a good idea.
* Finding improved sources of questions could be valuable.

<<footnotes "3" "There are, of course, completely valid alternatives. This style or approach reminds me very much of storm decks in Vintage MTG. There are radically different mindsets amongst the storm player base, some being defensive, others offensive, even in identical contexts.">>

<<footnotes "2" "I'm here to nerdily virtue signal to her to get in her pants. I might not respect her character much more than Samwise, but I love her face, tits, ass, ratios, and attitudes.">>

<<footnotes "4" "Smother and cover me, baby. Jabba Like!">>

<<footnotes "5" "This is my primary source. I selected from it randomly initially. I do not modify the questions. My goal is to make sure I'm not merely selecting questions I //want// to answer. I'm trying to generate a semblance of objectivity. I have not reviewed these questions.">>
