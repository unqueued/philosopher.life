Good how about yours?
3 HR AGO
Have some good news for you
3 HR AGO
It's been emotional but productive. Got shopping done.
3 HR AGO
Awww emotional?
3 HR AGO
Everything okay?

I think so. I'm not on speaking terms with my creators, but I received a letter from them (first in several years). Just thinking about it, wrestling.

My goodness- well I don’t mean to push my faith on to you- but your real creator the ultimate creator is watching over you and understands what you are feeling more than anyone can! Was it a positive letter or?

I do believe in an Unmoved Mover, a Beginning, a Source, A Sufficient Reason, the Axiom of Reality. I don't think It is a personal god (I'm a deist). I think it's just us! Lol.

I don't trust the letter. =/ But, I very much want to.

By the way, if Ranga is ever annoying you, you have my permission to open the door to let him in (you might accidentally catch someone in their underwear, but nobody cares). He can get in whenever he wants through the cat door, but I think he prefers to be ushered by humans (to remembered, for us affirm that he is one of us, lol). We never lock our doors in front or back (just in case you ever need to come inside).

Anyway, what's the good news?

I’m sure you have every right not to trust the letter. And I hope that in time you are able to progress in trusting or seeing that regardless of it all some people may never change a damn thing. Definitely a hard position to be in and I apologize I wish I had the magic dust to fix the emotions it has stirred up.

The good news is we might stay for another year
3 HR AGO
Yay!
