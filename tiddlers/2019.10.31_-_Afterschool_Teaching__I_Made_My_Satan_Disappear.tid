title: 2019.10.31 - Afterschool Teaching: I Made My Satan Disappear

Halloween at a school is cute. 30% of the students and 5% of the teachers dress up. Whitney dressed as a fan of her favorite basketball team. She also cried today because Curry has an injury which will cause her to miss seeing him at the game. That does suck for her; I know it was a really big deal. 

Carson has been building catapults with the kids. Neat. She has extra cash to burn on the kids, and I appreciate that she makes it fun for them.

One-on-ones revolved largely around Halloween today. I had the chance to come out to play, flash my bright ugly colors, with 7C and his ELA teacher in discussing some terminology. I made 'em laugh, so it can't be that bad. 7CM confirmed she is [[gh057]]. 5E has a head filled with trivia; he's fun.

Whitney is chillin in the cafeteria and aims to take folks to watch a movie. Carson is running games. I took everyone who wanted to go to the lab (no Delp or Dorsey today). Music and computers, much closer to my living room.

7CM complained that someone took 4 grams of laced bliss from her jacket (which she just got out of lost+found), making a bloody scene about it. `/smh`, killing me, girl. I had to make sure no one saw her retrieve her hoodie, and she says her locker is cleared now. Begging her to be smarter than this. Had to walk over to her to quietly talk about a bunch. Fuck. She's too angry to see straight. Says she's not using, just dealing these days (uh huh). Giving me the "fine" treatment, lawdy. She cooled down and told me a joke:

<<<
I hate when people tell me I have so much to live for. I'm, like, yeah, duh: I have to turn my cat into Satan.
<<<

Perfect sing-song delivery. <3. Asked her to write a poem on that tiktok bullshit. I am the worst kind of hippie.

AJ wanted to play-argue with me. I am 12yo at heart, annoying AF, and happy to play the dumbest language games imaginable if they amuse me. She amuses me, and she causes me to light up and come out full force. =)

Random outbursts of "OK Boomer" today from my children. <3. Let the hate flow through you, children.
