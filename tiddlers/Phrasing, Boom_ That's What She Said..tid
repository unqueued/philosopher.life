!! About:

//It's perfectly natural.//

I don't know the question, but sex is definitely the answer.

-- Woody Allen
<<<

You know I am profoundly honest with you (perhaps to a fault). I do not hide information from you.<<ref "1">> I tell you the truth as best as I can understand and express it. This page is no different.

We need to talk about sex. Don't be shy or embarrassed; we have to talk about this. It's important to your health and happiness. I'll try to keep it simple and even humorous (to some extent) because we should laugh at being afraid of honesty and shedding ignorance.

Sex is one of those semi-taboo topics that sometimes make people uncomfortable, and yet I don't want you to feel uncomfortable talking about it with me. You need someone with whom you can talk about sex. That's my job as your parent, my dudes. We need to continue having these conversations.

Sex is a part of being human. It's a big topic.<<ref "2">> Sex is complex in multiple cognitive, affective, and executive arenas. The science of sex, its physicality, activity, and biology, must be well-understood. The phenomenological experience of sex and the relationship dynamics require your analysis. Further, you must understand the social, political, and economic conceptual frameworks and implications of sex. Sex is a world to learn, experience, and reason wisely about.

My goal is for you to use your sexual organs wisely and to make your persistent identity happy. Like most of your appendages and cavities (and frankly your mind and body in general), you should attempt to use them regularly and thoughtfully. Use your sexuality to flourish.
