title: 2019.05.02 - Afterschool Teaching: Labtastic

Matt and I discussed the changes in this program over the past 3 years. He was proud of the authoritarian processes he implemented. He's less interested in the academic aspect. He misses the unhealthy snacks they used to hand out. He's proud of fulfilling promises to stay with the kids until they graduated. I suppose he's not going to be able to give me more detailed answers.

We talked about how surreal this summer must feel for him. I had one similar to it almost 15 years ago (though I didn't discuss it). 

I'm so happy to have a new delivery of food and goods. We needed it. 

5AS is having a first and last legal name change, but she said it was fine to refer to her by either. She is yet another child being adopted recently. A significant percentage of the kids in this program experience profound familial turmoil. Ofc, conservatives will blame family unit disintegration on the lack of virtue in the poor, but it's obvious that capitalism plays a much larger role in these outcomes.

I did crowd control, Mitchell took a handful, and then I took everyone to the lab. Matt and Whitney finally decided to do something, and they took some to the library and then the gym. 

It's interesting to hear so many of my students who consider their friends to be fake (good job, that's right: hunt for the [[gems]] kiddos). 

I continue to try to convince my children to write their feelings and experiences down, especially the hard ones. I'm a fan of them making music out of it for the outlet (they are actually trying to express themselves, even if only to each other). I beg them not to say some things so loudly they will get in trouble for it (unless they really know the price they will pay as martyrs, and even then I think their suffering will not be worth it), and some of them realize I'm not squelching. 7Jm and I, however, escalated. I eventually sent him away. He feels as though if he acts like he is going to cry then he should get his way too. He went for a smarmy smooth talk route. That kid is hella manipulative, lol. I wish he listened to 6CM more often; she understands the space I try to afford them a bit more, imho (though that is subject to change too, I am sure).

6TB and I talked a bunch. It's interesting to see how most of the poor kids still get an allowance even though I can't afford to give my children one (one of the tradeoffs, however, is that my children receive an education like none other). She is buying pencils and journaling notebook paper with her money (she showed me her current journal she's working on alongside using her computer). Do you want instant praise from me kid? Because that's how you get instant praise from me. =)

I spoke with The Janitor. We talked about the weekend and mowing. He was telling me about his wife's enormous health problems and the financial pressures they face. He works hard to keep her alive and expects very little. He's disgusted by the fact that people get "raped by the system." He sort of waffled though by offering a minor defense of capitalism, and I offered my confession as a counterargument. He doesn't want to say I was wrong or bad, and I made it quite clear I was. He said I was paying my penance at the school and I was number 1 in his book. Too kind, sir. I'm not the one mopping the floors after working in a mindless job as a zombie for 25 years to pay for the sins of others.

Minor but reasonable learning opportunity kerfuffle between kids breaks out and I'm letting it play out (I'm the only one who stands with the kids; I do my paperwork and get the fuck out of the office). It is loud enough to drag Matt out of the office for appearance's sake. He attempts to define Respect for them; I'm glad he tried. A few minutes later they start again. I join them this time. I have had far too many children talk to me about their genitalia today. The most disheartening episodes have been the number of kids who are clearly depressed and who speak of suicide (even jokingly like it's nothing). It's constant. You can feel the bleakness everywhere.

Delp sends me home on time but has Whitney stay. I'm also the only one he thanks for coming in regularly. I'm not sure what to make of that.
