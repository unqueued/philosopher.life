You as will sir! I am thankful we have reconnected, even at a baselevel of random texts. I value them greatly. We talk about life without the mask and complete honesty.  I am thankful and greatful to have a friend like you! I will be lounging all weekend! (just me the wife and kiddo) Feel free to Holla at me if you get bored!

I am grateful that we have the chance to reconnect too. It's how I hope to construct myself. It's a privilege for me.

It's been a good weekend. I got to see my uncle, and I know it might be the last time. Kinda surreal.

Monthly Audit and Family Time today.

We've had a much needed break, and my wife is sleeping a bit better now. So, I'm happy about that.

I'm afraid to ask. But I suspect your uncle is in bad health, or do you think with the upcoming move you won't be able to visit. Or both?

He's okay, but he's old. I don't know when we will be able to visit him.

I'm glad the woman of the house is sleeping better. I'm sad the holiday is coming to a close. We had good family time but alot of questions remained unanswered.
