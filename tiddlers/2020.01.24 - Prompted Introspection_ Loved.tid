title: 2020.01.24 - Prompted Introspection: Loved

Each [[other]] objectively [[irwartfrr]] to their subjective contexts. It's actually possible, however ridiculously unlikely. It sucks that we have this multi-ordered game which arises from our predictions that assume people are going to be evil to some significant degree. What I ought to do given my knowledge of how people are likely to think and behave shifts, and it becomes much uglier. I end up [[loving|Love]] the possibility of who someone could be more than the rest of who someone is in a timeslice more often than not (including myself).
