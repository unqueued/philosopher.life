title: 2019.03.14 - Afterschool Teaching: Mattless

Daniel, Whitney, and I bonded just fine today. Whitney also noted that Delp should be doing the surveys since he has the office and the authority. I think he's scared to look stupid with the technology. Indeed, he isn't qualified to know what the kids need if he can barely use his own devices. He tasked me with being in charge of getting computers together. No problem: I <3 computers.

Oh, yeah, Whitney is strongly open to the possibility that sniffing her hand sanitizer will cure her cold. It must smell good to her.

Delp played a trick on us today. He acted like state was here. I am glad that I appear unflappable and took it neutrally. He got no rise out of me, lol. Whitney, of course, freaked out just fine for the both of us.

Whitney is taking the parents, Mitchell has taken 5th; I sent Daniel with them, and I took the other 3 grades.

I'm surprised but not by the number of students who don't have paper and pencils. I bored them to do death by actually forcing them to do homework, read, write, and draw. At least they have music. Delp took a peekaloo but left immediately. My EDM must have scared him away, that devil music.

5:24f is hitting Mr. K's for her elective. Noice.

Folks showed me their raps. They asked me to rap; uh...sorry, kids. The amount of pain in their words hurt. They really know that almost no one loves them. I wouldn't be stable in their shoes either (hell, I've never been). 

I had lots of small interactions today. Nothing terribly memorable except 8Hf and 5:24f talked to me about "philosophers" they studied today. They were almost excited to talk with me about it. I about died when they told me they were learning about Hawthorne and transcendentalists. Alright, well I'll play that dude up too, but please kill me now.

Eventually, we hit the library to chill. I annoyed my namesake with music she has never heard before. We talked about new experiences and the nature of music. She eventually took over as pretend teacher, and I drew her some geometric trip art in highlighter. 

Daniel, 8Cf, and I talked about food and cooking. We are all fat, and the food magazines they were looking at were essentially pornography. Cool. I know basically nothing besides the fact that I like to eat. I can pronounce a couple fancy words, but my brother is a chef, so I ought not disappoint him. No, I just want to eat. Me hungry.

I am ready for Matt to be gone.
