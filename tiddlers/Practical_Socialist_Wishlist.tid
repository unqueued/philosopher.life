title: Practical Socialist Wishlist

* Sovereignty
** People of the world, unite. We already are globalized, except we do not cooperate together. We are ruled by the few. We must build the Decentralized League of Nations so as to have the rule of law over humanity in order to control the hyperclass elite who transcend mere national boundaries. There must be a well-formed tyranny of the majority (maximally decentralized tyranny); it is the only way to prevent the centralization of tyranny.
*** We must cede the powers of the 1st world over to the entire world.
*** I concede several federalist problematics. Let us find the game-theoretically best federalist variant we can find.

* Voting
** Digital Ranged Voting
** Computational Voter Proxy Infrastructures for decentralizing powers into votes as much as possible. Maximize the expressitivity of my political preferences through chains of proxies that I create (or have people help me create [i.e. they are my proxy]). Ultimately, this is the only logistically feasible way to maximize voter empowerment. Decentralization begins here. It's why we go digital. This is cryptographically and technically feasible.

* Tech
** Eliminate Intellectual Property entirely
** Completely take over the networking infrastructure of the US while being heavily audited by the public.
*** Remove all losses of privacy and anonymity possible.
** Government sponsored [[Outopos]] software and hardware mesh networking. Immediate deployment.
*** Use whatever means possible. People have reasons to share with each other on [[Outopos]], and the government can freely strengthen the network.
** Free laptop, phone, and networking equipment with easy to use instructions. Created and audited by the FLOSS community.
** Government funded, open-source, Rust-based rework of hardware and software. 
*** Publicly chosen auditors who are paid handsomely to find flaws. We pay for public redteams.
** Crack down on public corporations. 
** Build free competitors and artificial market conditions to build public competitors to digital services. It's the best way to break the monopoly.

* Market
** If not owned by the state entirely, users must have 3 or more competitors for any low-necessity (or higher) service or product.
*** If competitors do not exist, the States creates competitors. 
** The public may vote to dissolve any corporate entity. The public is root.
** Hybridize privatization in the right way. Make it so we subsidize companies who follow the moral rules, we kick CEO's and board members off that don't play by the rules, etc. Essentially, this is a tax on being evil.
** We can't actually tax the transnational corporations, and we can't force them to play by the rules, so let's compete with them by unifying against them in the market. Let's run them out of business. Don't make it a huge subsidy, but make it enough that (1) workers get paid better and are treated better than at publicly-owned companies, (2) top talent has non-trivial incentive to leave and join the subsidized. I realize, this creates a market inefficiency, but morality will always cost us that.
