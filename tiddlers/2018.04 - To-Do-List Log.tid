!! Audit:

* I didn't finish my modularized resume, but I'm hoping I don't have to for now.
* I didn't do anything with NixOS. I've set it aside. That's okay.
* I failed pretty miserably on positive reinforcement. I'm sorry; I call it like I see it. If you do a good job, I'll say it. If you don't, then I'll say you didn't.
* We're finding out whether or not our little birds can fly.
* I clearly had significant shifts in what I was trying to do this month. Perhaps that poor planning or the result of fixing bad planning, or both. I don't know. If I were better at this, I wouldn't make these mistakes. I need to keep trying harder.
* My kids still haven't attempted to root their phones =/
* Meaningness is sidelined, perhaps permanently. I'm glad to see that it forced me onto one side or the other. I don't think his system is cogent in the end.
* I did push very hard in philosophy, although it doesn't look like. That's okay. I can't expect to nail this down at 32. I can have a seed which I cultivate though!
* I did walk with my wife everynight, but at this point, I don't have the energy.
* I planned to read this month, and I did.
* I was clearly psyched about the job!
* My daily lists were quite short this month.
* Oh, yeah, I forgot about many of the projects I engaged in that actually were somewhat successful. My extraction, in particular, was cool.
* Glad we switched back to rtorrent. I've struggled enough for the last time with deluge.
* I said the word "prep" quite a bit for different events. I like that I prep, even for things which aren't fun.
* We finally watched the Bladerunner movie. I'm glad I did. Loved the first 2 hours, but not the last.
* Oh yeah, I forgot about D2! I actually defeated the Ubers. I'm kind of proud of myself.
* I like those days where I finish a whole book in one sitting.
* Fasting has been mildly successful. I keep forgetting sundown on Friday!
* I'm pleased my wife celebrated 420 with me!
* One of my weekly TDL's became a daily.
* Glad I prepped like I did and studied for my test ;P
* Ah, I'm also glad that when I found out that I wouldn't start the job up for a week that I found productive things to do with my time centering around the job itself.
* Good fucking job, mate!
