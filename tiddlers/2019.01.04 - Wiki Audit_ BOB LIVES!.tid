title: 2019.01.04 - Wiki Audit: BOB LIVES!

In the arms of a teenager. [[j3d1h]] and I decided to just build Bob from scratch each time. That upgrade process is a clusterfuck. We upgrade TW systemwide, upgrade the html by hand on the official site, rename Bob to a backup, build Bob anew, then we import the html file (decompose). Boom! Bob is the problem. I can't complain one bit. That is cutting edge TW tech right thar.

5.1.19 and 1.1.12. Thank [[JHBFC]], but mostly my daughter working alongside me. I've never tandem admin'd with anyone before realtime like this. It felt like a silly hackerflick. *cue dumb line here* -- It lives!
