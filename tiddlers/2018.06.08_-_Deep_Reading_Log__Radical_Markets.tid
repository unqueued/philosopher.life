Auction-based visas is interesting. I'm actually open to the possibility of radically opening human mobility. I've always found isolationism and redscare mentalities to be dangerous. I think voting with our mobility is ultimately a good thing, of course I will blindly follow the guerilla Libertarian too often. I recognize I would not benefit from it, but I think it would be good for us all. Insofar as the gains are ultimately not given to capitalists but instead to the global poor, I think we should do it.
