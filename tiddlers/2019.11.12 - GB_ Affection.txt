I'm thinking about abandoning the attack. Obviously on a technical level I'm in over my head. But I'm not convinced I have to completely abandon the project. There might be other ways to accomplish this if I can get creative

It is my hope that the tankies will build decentralized structures resilient to weapons before going on the offense. 
Nov 12, 2019 10:00pm
I am increasingly convinced there is no escaping radical violence though. =(
Nov 12, 2019 10:01pm
I think it's possible to not be the bad guy and initiate it, but to be willing to meet
Nov 12, 2019 10:27pm
Reactionaries exercising violence with necessary force
Nov 12, 2019 10:27pm
Aye. I can see the sense in trying to meet and reason. I've long stuck to that quote, "violence is the last refuge of the incompetent." I despise when I have no other options. When reason fails, I only have unreason left.
Nov 12, 2019 10:31pm
Oh no sorry, the break made that come across differently. I didn't mean meet. I meant meet violence with force lol
Nov 12, 2019 10:32pm
Ah, I totally should have understood that, lol (I was confused). I also strongly agree with that claim too! 
Nov 12, 2019 10:34pm
A lot of people think I'm crazy when I say that. They hate looking at it (and, I can see why; it's painful, and it makes me `/gulp`).
Nov 12, 2019 10:36pm
I try talking with reactionaries. I think they tend to come away feeling repulsed or even offended by me. My gibberish and poor form causes their amygdalas to fire off in fear when I call them out. The brain defends itself against all accusers and attackers. It's memetic violence first. If that dialectical ball-of-lightning doesn't work, then it has to be more physical. Often, I'm afraid I wait too long in unjustified hopes that reason will get the job done (especially since we aren't terribly reasonable creatures always).

I've decided that Tit for Two Tats must be Gradualized (http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/20/4/12.html), escalating in punishment with repeat defectors (catches a number of vampiric strategies). It's where I'm going with reactionaries.
Nov 12, 2019 10:44pm
I think you're giving them too much credit. They're not repulsed by any sloppiness you may be bringing to the table. They're repulsed by what you believe because it's fundamentally ab affective response all the way down
Nov 13, 2019 12:25am
What are your thoughts on [[REDACTED]]?
Nov 13, 2019 12:49am
If you are extremely wealthy, you can get away with it.
Nov 13, 2019 12:50am
(almost a truism, I'm afraid)
Nov 13, 2019 12:51am
Lol
Nov 13, 2019 12:51am
But otherwise no?
Nov 13, 2019 12:51am
It depends on what you are doing with the [[REDACTED]]. If illegal intentions can be demonstrated, then it may be a bad idea. You might find a safe [[REDACTED]] and be very careful with geo-positioning, never let it touch your identity. You can also find services online. I am still a huge fan of Whonix. 
Nov 13, 2019 12:56am
Yes I would do it from a [[REDACTED]] and from the right kind of location
Nov 13, 2019 12:59am
I'm trying to brainstorm and think of other ways to accomplish my objectives
Nov 13, 2019 12:59am
[[REDACTED]]
Nov 13, 2019 5:28am
This is so fucking hard
Nov 13, 2019 5:29am
I don't understand how anyone could be as stupid as I was
Nov 13, 2019 5:33am
I can't [[REDACTED]] and I don't know what to do
Nov 13, 2019 5:33am
Philosophy means nothing to me anymore compared to them
Nov 13, 2019 5:42am
And I'm worried that because I chose philosophy over them I'm going to grow to hate it
Nov 13, 2019 5:42am
If I knew I was eventually going to see them again I could wait. I'd wait for years. But the fact that I don't know if I ever will terrifies me. And I can't even handle the thought I won't
Nov 13, 2019 5:46am
I'm losing my mind
Nov 13, 2019 5:46am
I have no doubt I would be losing my mind too. I don't think you are experiencing psychosis, but I think you are living in a world of shit. I can't imagine the pain you are in. It also feels like you might hate yourself, but you don't deserve to be hated. If so, I hope one day you will forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you've made here. You hold yourself to very high standards (which I appreciate greatly). I also don't know what one ought to do in your shoes either. It's the kind of problem which may marr you no matter which way you go. 
Nov 13, 2019 10:14am
I think giving [[REDACTED]] a present is a great idea.
Nov 13, 2019 10:16am
I assume people might have mixed emotions about gift-giving here. How they feel or react won't be up to you. But, I think it makes sense to try. It shows you still care, and you obviously do.
Nov 13, 2019 10:19am
Eden doesn't care that I still care. She'll be angry I did an end-run around her if she finds out
Nov 13, 2019 10:23am
Since it is reasonable for [[REDACTED]] to live without the present, he afford not to receive it. Send it to her, and let her throw it away. There is only so much that is up to you. 
Nov 13, 2019 10:24am
No, at least if it goes through [[REDACTED]] there's a chance she won't find out and he'll get it
Nov 13, 2019 10:26am
I would tell him [[REDACTED]] doesn't have to know it's from me
Nov 13, 2019 10:27am
That is a fine option. Sam will be happy.
Nov 13, 2019 10:28am
If resolution is impossible, then that is probably the way to go. 
Nov 13, 2019 10:28am
[[REDACTED]]. I asked her months ago if I could send him a Christmas present and she said no. I'd say resolution is impossible
Nov 13, 2019 10:30am
Fuck. =/
Nov 13, 2019 10:30am
[[REDACTED]]
Nov 13, 2019 10:30am
It he had just not been an idiot when getting his peace corps physical he'd be gone for good
Nov 13, 2019 10:31am
Can I run an idea past you?
Nov 13, 2019 8:47pm
Of course.
Nov 13, 2019 9:02pm

Nov 13, 2019 9:06pm
Step 2. Step 2. ???? Step 3. Profit

Nov 13, 2019 9:07pm
I know I sound like a crazy person. You're the only person I trust sign this shit to because you're the only person who isn't like "oh yeah that sucks. Welp, plenty fish in the sea"
Nov 13, 2019 9:08pm
I am a crazy person, so I can relate somewhat. 
Nov 13, 2019 9:15pm
I'm not sure why this attack works. Why should someone believe it's real?
Nov 13, 2019 9:17pm
Well that's the problem
Nov 13, 2019 9:17pm
I have to balance believability with technical expertise
Nov 13, 2019 9:18pm
The more technical expertise one can leverage, the more believable an attack one can produce

Do you have venmo?
Nov 14, 2019 8:51pm
Good thread! =)
Nov 14, 2019 9:47pm
I do have a Venmo, but I've never used it.
Nov 14, 2019 9:47pm
[[REDACTED]]
Nov 14, 2019 9:48pm
I do, but I'm not convinced I ought. =(
