title: 2019.11.05 - Afterschool Teaching: The Spiral

Carson got a ticket. The day is not going well for her. =/. I handed the activity books and accompanying hardware to her. Hopefully, she'll put it to good use.

One-on-ones were actually difficult today. Hard to start already saying goodbye to these students. I wasn't going to tell them, but they found out. It was nice to hear that they wanted me to continue being a teacher. I'm going to miss some of these students so much. Hurts to leave [[gems]] behind in the desert.

We were all in the library today. It's the first time in a long time. Basketball game, so increased security. More cop action, unfortunately. I wandered and talked. 

It was wonderful watching Carson in her element. That girl don't take shit in the right moments. She also gave incredible space and solid social advice to my hoods. 

Magic, tons of reading, some board games, some conversations.

My kids in the lab, music, delicious. We had fun.
