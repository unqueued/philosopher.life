title: 2019.11.02 - TDL: Family Time!

* We will have a lot to read and talk about tomorrow, I think. Best make something easy for dinner.
** Pasta and salad.
* Family Time!
** It's cold. We probably need to hit the thrift stores for another round, especially since it's going to be cold in CT.
*** [[1uxb0x]] is growing especially.
* Probably coffeebliss again, eh? Why not? 
* You've got a fuckton to do in your wiki, btw.
* Doubt you will have time for sex, but the house will be to yourself for a while. :P.
* You also have a radical incentive to smash through what's sitting in FF now. It looks like a rebuild is in order. What are you going to do, have more than 2-3 versions of FF? ROFL.
** Please, no. PLZ.
