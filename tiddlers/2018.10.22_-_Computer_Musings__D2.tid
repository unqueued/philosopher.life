Wine looks like shit in my current configuration of i3. There are good reasons to let it float though. Had to add that to the config for the game window. I have multiple versions/backups to walk through. Found the last. I was exploring HC last time. I haven't setup backups, but that's okay. Considering my nightly snapshots and weekly snapshots (and their redundancies), I can afford to be lazy (famous last words!).
