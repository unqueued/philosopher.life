Omg, please stop moving so fast through the argument! You are fucking killing me. I adore what you doing here, but it's eating me up at the same time. You can't just pass over teleology like this. I think it's time to put our Straussian lenses on and see how the most famous scientist to ever walk the planet would radically alter his approach given a contemporary understanding of science (let alone the other disciplines, including philosophy specifically). 

Yeah, the telic purpose is traditionally how we interpret dat final cause. From [[The Unmoved Telos]] standpoint, that's also correct. You can't ignore the Nicomachean Ethics here when it comes to this issue. There's a timelessness/transcendence problem here that allows us to make that move . To my eyes, talking about causation from a temporal lens, we will have to admit a kind of reduction you hope to deny him...but I think he would accept it! I wish I could go back in time and talk to Old Boy.
