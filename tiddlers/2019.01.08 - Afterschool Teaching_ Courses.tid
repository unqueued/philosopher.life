title: 2019.01.08 - Afterschool Teaching: Courses

The Afterschool Seminar/Course ideas are ready.

I pushed 5LL hard in tutoring today. We are working toward understanding fractions.

I helped 8S with her geometry. She is quick. Later she asked me what she asked all the adults: who in history would you like to meet. I cut through her fishing and discussed the merit of the question and strategies for answering it.

6DM got his algebra mostly right. He doesn't know why or how to show his work. I found out with all the adults that he can't read. Tutoring was difficult especially since he has given up hope (understandably).

I tutored lots of kids. All math questions are mine, but I handled a lot of others. I'm worn out trying to understand their minds enough to give the the reasoning they need to see it.

6MA and I talked about Minecraft and life. She is the outsider. I'm literally the only person I've seen her talk to so far.

Parents have come up to me to talk about their chillun. Ok.

Matt and I talked about the paperwork and why he wants to be a teacher. He may work out. He and the vice took masses of students so I could tutor. I'm grateful they didn't have a problem with it (at least not so far). He sent me this: Watch "SlamNation: Taylor Mali - "What Teachers Make": https://youtu.be/RGKm201n-U4.
