Rebecca didn't sleep well, and nor did my brother. He was chipper though.

Kyla prefers Rebecca strongly. She was able to chill with my brother, but once Rebecca walks in the room, the opportunity cost is presented. 

It went well enough for them. My brother felt better. It's been a good test.

Also, the AC repairmen came. The price was basically misquoted, but that got settled. There is asbestos around the tiling. They called the office, and the office claimed to let the AC guys know. They didn't, and the guys didn't even take breaks. The apprentice told my brother that people get fired for asking for breaks. My brother spoke with them. The older guy didn't seem to care, but the apprentice seemed to care. My brother has their permission to write about it in the review. Capitalism sucks.

Kyla may be moved to a different family member tomorrow. 

My brother was off to get sushi. I hope he'll get some good sleep.
