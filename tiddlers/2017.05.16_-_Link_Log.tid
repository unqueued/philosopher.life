* An outstanding talk about continued centralization of the internet and web in particular, and he offers an alternative "Othernet" - https://vimeo.com/217265093
* Not boring article about capitalism, democracy, and globalization. I find it too charitable to capitalism, but what's new? - http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/sending-jobs-overseas/
* I've seen lots of people live on a laptop alone, with docking. I am not surprised to see a push for the phone to be the ultimate all-in-one device. It is not clear to me that mobile computing will catch up enough for me to desire switching - https://maruos.com/#/
* Footnotes to Plato echoed again - https://aeon.co/essays/what-plato-knew-about-behavioural-economics-a-lot
* I think it's hilarious how they do not see the connections between the what they take to be the primary causes of the Life Expectancy gap and income inequality as well as other centralizations of power in our profoundly capitalist society - https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2017/05/16/widening-gap-in-u-s-life-expectancy/
* Publishers only entered the digital book market kicking and screaming, as always for media companies (and, I'm well aware of the aesthetic and pricing considerations which we falsely claim accounts for the decline) - https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/14/how-real-books-trumped-ebooks-publishing-revival
* Late Stage Capitalism and the Enslavement of Masses bias being confirmed, again - http://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year-survey-data-show-millions-of-workers-are-paid-less-than-the-minimum-wage-at-significant-cost-to-taxpayers-and-state-economies/
* Hard-to-fathom STANDARD slavery in modern suburban America - https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/
