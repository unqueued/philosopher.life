title: 2019.09.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Shaking Hands

!! Respond to the following gem:

I don't mind shaking hands with human beings. Are you one?

One of my favorite sentiments of all time. I'm a moth to a flame here. He is clearly on fire. I make a Kantian distinction (which not all Kantians make) between homo sapiens and [[Humanity]], or more accurately, between mere Dasein and justified personhood. Are you a justified person? Of course, this requires contextualization. Our lives can be Hursthousianly marred by moral luck, and those who have gone the wrong direction for too long can only cover so much ground as well. The scope for Darwalian appraisal and recognition respects range from the pregnant [[phenomenological]] present (pure being, or what have you) to our [[4DID]] and perhaps other emergences (into grand hyperobjects). Indeed, I think Saints [[MLK]] and [[MX]] are better persons than I am regardless of circumstances and in virtue of them (they've simply tried way harder than I have with what they had). Most people I think I have an insanely high and perhaps even [[cultic|Cults]] standard here, but to my eyes, I'm lowballing it to be hedged-conservatively inclusive in the enumeration of that 3% remnant. 

Dialectically, it is conceptually necessary that we outgroup, regardless of how much we wish it wasn't. [[T42T]] and [[Gradual]] are some key approaches to quantifying [[The Golden Rule]]. I do not know how to construct wisely enough here.
