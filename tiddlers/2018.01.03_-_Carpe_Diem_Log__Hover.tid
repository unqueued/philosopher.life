* Woke at 8:40
** Didn't sleep nearly as well. I'm thinking I took the cannabliss too late at 3.
* Woke kids
* Read+Write
* Clean
* Shopped
* My head hurt so much I laid down and napped.
* Killed the P2P and voila, I have a ipv4. Fuck it.
* HTPC plug seems better on the other side...although, it's not perfect.
* I actually took aspirin and drank. My headache finally broke. Now it simmers.
** I have no idea why this fucking worked???
* I stayed up until 2 watching Madmen
* Archer + Bed
** Also, my nightly farts are getting to be amazingly strong. I couldn't stop laughing.
