* Think About It
** https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/13/new-study-finds-strength-of-imagination-has-no-association-with-creative-ability-or-achievement/
*** Sounds right to me. But, I consider myself to have a strong imagination (schizotypally, even) without being very creative.

*** `/yawn`, saw it with Sanders too though. Everyone thought I was insane for predicting Trump's win before the primaries. Cynicism pays off, kids. Hence, I don't believe it. I'm happy to support Leftism. I will speak the socialist truth to anyone who will listen. I aim to have good praxis. My jadedness is a useful barrier to bullshit. I'm still convinced revolution is the only out.

*** I live next to a scowler (:P) on the topic. I am impressed with the initial moves. The realpolitik contrarianism and the woo beyond it, not so much. Get ready to have your asses handed to you.

*** I don't think it will matter. People are punished for it still.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/health/facebook-psychology-health.html
*** Ironically, it's manipulation using it, and it's sedation without it. Being an effective political animal won't make you happy. Being content while being moral is likely your best shot.

*** Disappointed in not more openly seeking free speech.

*** This is a rant. I so wanted to have your babies until the end. You get it so goddamn right on the reciprocity, pointing to [[The Golden Rule]] heuristic, but you let it drop! What the fuck!? NO NO NO NO NO!! I am fucking SHOCKED by the number of people who are exclusively Rawlsian scholars who can't get this shit right. Rawls was not a saint either (turned evil on us). Yall muhfuckers need Jesus, Diogenes, Kant, and Marx.

*** I'm listening. Predictions for a long time. Is it happening? Or, this is centralized control choosing who dies?

*** Some excellent points in the article. It's not looking far enough down the road, and just because most people are incompetent doesn't mean everyone is.
*** Ads aren't the only thing that matters here.
