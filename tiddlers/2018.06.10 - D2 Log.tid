Lore helm, wearing my resist charms to get around 60 AR, 3 P Top armor, and now I have 170 MF. I searched for 4 socket on vendors, but no go. 3 is enough.

CE scales so fucking hard in NM. Having done a lot of hell baal runs with my necro has prepared me very nicely for this. CE is almost maxed too.
