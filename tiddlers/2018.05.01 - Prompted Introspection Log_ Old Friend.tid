title: 2018.05.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Old Friend

!! Tell me about an old friend you've lost touch with.

I tend to have 1-2 friends at most during any given time period of my life. I've had more, but ultimately, they weren't my friends upon reflection. The more I look, the more I'm convinced that true friendship is profoundly rare. 

One of my first friends was Jeff. I forget his last name. He was a pseudo-street kid bounced around in the system before eventually landing with his crazy grandmother who spoiled him. He was probably a poor influence on me. I got along fine with him, but autism and dark triads seem to clump together in various contexts in my experience. After I became a teenager, I never got in touch with him again.

I found out later he has children. That is a scary thought. From what I understand he has partially abandoned one of them to stay with his new girlfriend. It's a fairly fucked up set of relationships. I think seeing the dysfunctionality of his family helped me see it in mine more clearly. In an odd way, I'm grateful to him.
