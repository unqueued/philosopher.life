title: 2019.08.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Visionlessness

!! Respond to the following gem:

Many groups that have the power to make life decisions for others don't ever have to live out the consequences.

Principalâ€“agent problems are moral hazards insofar as we fail to fittingly respond to various [[dok]] and emergences of conflicts of interests, which I take to be an incredibly broad notion. [[Power]]-over [[others]] [[irwartfrr]] requires the exercise of [[The Golden Rule]], and that is quite rare in my experience. Unfortunately, pure P2P political [[power]] structures cannot give rise to a stable, efficient, or effective Rule of Law. Proxying and funneling power into representation is necessary, even if only to handle the threats of centralized powers which would seek to destroy and consume socialists. Since we cannot escape some variation of the principal-agent problem, we must tackle it head-on from the bottom-up. I am saddened to find so few people with vision.
