title: 2019.08.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Dispersion

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Systematic benefits in a society are dispersed from the top down, and its sacrifices emerge from the bottom up.
<<<

The antecedent is perhaps ambiguous. It's not so much from the top down but more toward the top from the bottom (which isn't to say the bottom doesn't benefit to any degree in redistribution, infrastructure use, etc.). I'll agree that [[power]] tends to centralize toward the top, and this is at the expense of those at the bottom of the pyramid. I find that I can pass this hurdle with many capitalists and reactionaries, but it's another ballgame to convince them this description isn't the prescription.
