title: 2018.02.24 - Prompted Introspection Log: Failed Promise to Feed pet

!! What would you do if you promised to feed your pet and you didn't?

For how long did I not feed them? If it were long enough, and nobody fed them, the cats would likely begin tearing into our food. I don't think they would starve. But, I'm extremely confident someone else would feed them. Our cats are highly communicative with us, and it would be known almost immediately. So, I wouldn't need to immediately feed them after breaking my promise.

Why did I break my promise? Was I saving the world or something else that provided overriding features? Let us assume not, since that defeats the purpose of this question.

"Promised to whom?" is the real question. Breaking my promise is a serious offense in my eyes. Promises are always, at the very least, to myself. Breaking promises is not how I wish to constitute myself, and it is an integrity-defeater. My persistent identity requires that I follow through. I will admit, this is not exactly the right reason though, as I am morally permitted to fail to empathize or identify with my past identity. My present and future is what matters fundamentally in that respect.

Furthermore, failing to respect the dignity of others is also equally immoral. I wouldn't need to just apologize to myself and try to work on who I am, but I would need to apologize to and restore my victims to whom I lied as well as those who suffered undue utilitarian losses.
