Good must dos for a quality relationship.
Feb 13 6:43pm
How are you doing?
Feb 13 6:43pm
I'm doing well. Feeling better and more normal. According to the state of CT, I'm an official resident and stuff. That's nice.
Feb 13 7:30pm
Eating like a pig too, which is great. =)
Feb 13 7:31pm
how about you? you done for the week chillin back in Somerset?
Feb 13 7:37pm
No not yet. I have to work tomorrow I took Monday off. I was up here. But just couldn't sleep well Sunday night and couldn't make myself go to work. Lol
Feb 13 8:23pm
They make it kinda easy to get your time in. You essentially have all week to get your 40 hours. People work 4am - 2pm and some work 9-5. Some work 8s some work 10s or 12s.
Feb 13 8:24pm
Ah
Feb 13 8:50pm
Nice to have that flexibillity
Feb 13 8:50pm
So what are your plans for the weekend?
Feb 14 2:57pm

Feb 14 7:12pm
Fuck yeah, dude. That's awesome.
Feb 14 7:12pm
I bet she is going to have a blast.

Mom getting a makeover. Hahah
Feb 14 7:12pm
Oh, I bet they are very lucky to learn from your wife too.
Feb 14 7:12pm
Not as fun for a guy, I assume.
Feb 14 7:13pm
(if you do get a makeover, I want to see*)
Feb 14 7:13pm
It was a big deal for alot of parents. Lots of them have had very few sleepovers. Hesitant with their girls. It's a different time.
Feb 14 7:14pm
I totally get that.
Feb 14 7:14pm
It's great that they trust your family.
Feb 14 7:14pm
We were afraid no one was gonna come. But. We got a basketball team! Lol
Feb 14 7:14pm
Agreed. I think one mom already cried when dropping her kiddo off. Lol
Feb 14 7:15pm
Lol
Feb 14 7:16pm
I think it's a fantastic thing, and it something missing in my offspring's lives.
Feb 14 7:17pm
You and I grew up randomly popping into people's neighborhoods, yards, and houses.
Feb 14 7:17pm
Need my offspring to be able to learn from those encounters.
Feb 14 7:18pm
And, it's hard to develop some kinds of relationships without them.
Feb 14 7:18pm
Dad's are weird. Even when I was a kid. But yeah. We grew up in differnt times. Drinking from the water hose cause we weren't allowed inside! Lol
Feb 14 7:18pm
Lol1
Feb 14 7:18pm
yup

perfeck
Feb 14 7:18pm
My wife is the shit though. The kids love her. And she is great with people! But yeah. We as dads are weird. Lol.
Feb 14 7:19pm
I am very apprehensive about letting Samantha go to random kids houses. Her invitations were very thorough and funny. Which we were complimented on. Lol

Feb 14 7:20pm
That is cute.
Feb 14 7:21pm
Notice the cover is here at Berea food court overlooking alumni fields.
Feb 14 7:22pm
Her*
Feb 14 7:22pm
Nope. Didn't even recognize it.
Feb 14 7:22pm
My window back into Berea is this hazy, revised, lossy, compressed, over-selected image.
Feb 14 7:23pm
It feels more like a fact of who I am than memories of experience.
Feb 14 7:24pm
That's interesting. It was like a hell I survived and then worked my way out of. Literally. Lol
Feb 14 7:24pm
That sounds like life too, lol.
Feb 14 7:25pm
shit is deep, yo
Feb 14 7:25pm
Haha. True. We are enduring a struggle with my job. A potential move. Kathys next career steps. It's alot to process.
Feb 14 7:26pm
Lots of recent arguments and discussions. But deciding what moves to make next isn't an easy one. As you know. Yall just made a huge leap!
Feb 14 7:27pm
Ur telling me.
Feb 14 7:27pm
Was over a year in the making.
Feb 14 7:27pm
I'd argue 4 years
Feb 14 7:27pm
(we just didn't know where we would be ending up at all, still don't, but I feel much closer)
Feb 14 7:28pm
I'm hoping that you all can move.
Feb 14 7:28pm
Definitely a commitment, super emotional, hard.
Feb 14 7:28pm
Lol. Right. I can't imagine. I'm terrified and still trying to figure it out. And unfortunately my job isn't even a 100% guaranteed. So. Makes it even harder. And the house we live in now is paid for but no jobs in this town that pay what I make. It's a frustrating conondrum.
Feb 14 7:30pm
I'm glad you feel closer.
