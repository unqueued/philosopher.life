title: 2019.11.02 - Prompted Introspection: Clothes Make The Person

!! What does "Clothes make the person" mean to you?

I sense many crucial interpretations of this phrase. 

# One day, some set of clothing, probably a pair of pants and loin-girding underwear, danced at a rave, partook of the TidePODS, lusted after each other very much, one blew their laundry load in the other, and after the spin cycle, a whole Dasein emerged. 
# It is also possible that clothing is a special "X" factor of personhood them philosophers are always hunting for. Wearing clothing is a necessary ingredient for one to have the dignity and universal rights of personhood. Those [[naked]] savages are barely even human, let alone persons.
# As an effective altruist, it's clear to me that the market is a relative force for good in the world, and it's up to each of us to shop for clothing as an activist who affect change through their wallets and greenwashed consumption habits. The clothes you choose to buy and wear sends the right signals to all the fitting persons, including corporations, in your life, and that makes you who you really are as a person.
# We use prejudiced heuristics, including prejudiced inferences about what clothing people are wearing, to weigh how valuable we think someone will be to our happiness.
