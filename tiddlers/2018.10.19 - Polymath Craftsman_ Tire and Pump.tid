title: 2018.10.19 - Polymath Craftsman: Tire and Pump

Tire went flat on the car. The mechanic couldn't fix the electrical problem in it, so I won't feel bad about failing there. We used the other vehicle for the pump. My son, thank god for them autisms, knew where the missing internal piece to our pump was. We put it together (I have no idea why it got taken apart ;P...I have a suspect in mind), and showed my son how to pump air into the tire. We talked about safety and PSI. The backseat got a cleaning, and I put the pump where it belongs (alongside our other equipment).
