title: 2019.02.06 - Prompted Introspection: Famous Places

!! What is a famous place you have seen or want to see?

My family took a 2-3ish week vacation to California when I was 14ish? It was quite memorable, or so I recall (minus the age XD). I've been to the Grand Canyon. I was impressed, found it beautiful, and then promptly preferred the gift shop. Raise poor kids, and they'll find the toys far more interesting. I still preferred Roswell, NM to it. Mexico was far more interesting. I wish we spent time there instead. The redwoods and white sands were fucking amazing.

Most of the famous places I want to visit the most require radical kinds of transportation and preparation. Visiting particular spots on the bottom of the ocean, the poles, space, etc. The trip itself is half the fun, I assume.

I don't travel much with my children, and I hope to fix that one day. Still, that isn't most of their education by a long shot. Traveling is a luxury, and most of the time, models are better than the real thing.
