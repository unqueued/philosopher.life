title: 2018.01.06 - Computer Musings: Wife's Wiki and Private

Teamviewer was damned useful. I gave another hack with proxies on Resilio Sync for her, but none of the proxy services (even the one I created on ATL) worked. /shrug, there is something I don't understand and likely can't find anytime soon.

My wife now has her wiki available at work as well. It took me 4 syncs on 3 different sync tools on 3 devices, but I've got it up and running. Finally!

Consequently, I've now made our family's private wiki something she has easy access to.=)
