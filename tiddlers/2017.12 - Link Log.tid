!! Audit:

* Completed most days. There was a week where I didn't.
* I see a lot more trash in these.
* Heavy mixture of almost all my categories at this point. I have an engine that works!
* I fear I have too much here. I can't possibly think about it. I think I keep running up against post-modernism again and again.
** What am I going to do about it? I want to be practical.
* My links tend to be very serious and generally sad. It is clearly what I hunt for the most in truth-seeking.
* I don't have large rabbitholes, nor do I have them often. Maybe this wasn't the most useful mechanic. Worth trying though, right?
* I love the word "Push" in title.Title because that is a nasty word for taking a shit. =)
* What would a positive link, besides a Tool or Interesting generally look like? Once a while Stunning does it.
** I want to understand how to shape my negativity. This may just be a stoic requirement.
** I'm often extremely angry after my reading. This is bad for my blood pressure, and yet, the truth must still be known. How do I care enough to be informed without losing my shit over the content? Yeah, I know I'm not in control of it. It still affects me. I'm not going to wish for the rape of the world and be glad my wish came true, dumb fucking stoicunts, lol.
** Maybe I should just laugh. Absurdity. Dada. Farce. Reduced to meaninglessness. That contradiction is very hard for me to hold consistently.
* Thiel is like a bogeyman for me.
** Trump is a child. Thiel is dangerous AF.
* I clearly don't have time for Wikipedia rabbitholing very often.
* I like that I have comments at the top. Sometimes a title.Title doesn't do the trick. 
* I definitely felt like I was drowning. 
** What kind of liferaft ought I build for myself? What are the right habits for this?
* I see a stronger migration of content to Think About It and Fishy
* I did a much better finding things for my son.
* I have had RAM constraints this past month. 
* My disconfirms are often about small things.
* I've never heard of a quarter of these sites...
** I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. Could be either. As usual, Aristotle, it depends.
* I'm glad I had some shorties in here.
