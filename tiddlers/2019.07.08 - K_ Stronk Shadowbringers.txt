Have a great day today! :blush:
MON 8:53 AM
You too.
MON 10:27 AM
What are you up to today?
MON 10:28 AM
Work! Working on a map for one of my campaigns too.
MON 10:34 AM
What about you? :)
MON 10:34 AM
Oh and Shadowbringers tonight.
MON 10:34 AM
You'll have to send me a picture of the map once you are done with it.
MON 10:39 AM
Been thinking about maps a bit recently.
MON 10:40 AM
Sounds fun.
MON 10:40 AM
How's the Shadowbringers game going? I assume you've been diving in already.
MON 10:44 AM
Will do!
MON 10:45 AM
Omg the story is so strong!
MON 10:45 AM
What makes it so stronk?
MON 10:45 AM
I didn’t wanna stop playing last night. I got to a very spicy twist.
MON 10:45 AM
We’ve been baited on a very important story beat since 2010
MON 10:46 AM
And now I genuinely sympathize with the bad guys.
MON 10:46 AM
That is always a special experience for me.
MON 10:47 AM
The #theempiredidnothing wrong effect (or, I'm positive there is some other famous word or trope for this thing in literature).
MON 10:47 AM
So we as the Warrior of Light are the champion of a Goddess of Light called Hydaelyn, and we fight against a group of otherworldly entities called Ascians that serve the god of darkness Zodiark. 

Part of our job in preserving the peace of the realm is to fight against monsters called “Primals” which are created and given shape+ form by the prayers and thoughts of their worshipers. 

In this new expansion, an Ascian is presenting himself as unaligned to both sides and has revealed that both Zodiark and Hydaelyn are nothing more than primals in themselves and despite his serving Zodiark, the god of darkness was created as a response to Hydaelyn’s unyielding light splitting their world into 14 pieces.
MON 10:51 AM
I’m so sorry for what might be the quickest and shittiest TLDR. Hahaha
MON 10:52 AM
Ah, so why does that cause you to sympathize with the bad guys?
MON 10:54 AM
Because up until this point, we just thought the Ascians were assholes and had no idea why they were causing trouble, but our supposedly good goddess of light took their world away from them. And all they want to do is make that right by recombining all 14 pieces.
MON 10:56 AM
So, do you get to choose who you will or what your character is like given that information?
MON 10:59 AM
There are some games where faction controls the storyline so fundamentally that there are multiple endings, in a sense.
MON 11:00 AM
Unfortunately no. Hydaelyn at the beginning of 2.0 bestowed upon us her blessing of light. The ramifications of that suggest that we literally cannot rebel against her will. Another important aspect of primals is their ability to exert a mental influence on their followers bidding them to do things they don’t want to do.
MON 11:02 AM
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE NOW
MON 11:02 AM
Lol
MON 11:02 AM
It’s like the “Would you kindly?” Twist from Bioshock but much worse.
MON 11:02 AM
We’ve liberated entire nations in her name.
MON 11:03 AM
Murica, fuckyeah
MON 11:03 AM
[[L]] hasn’t caught up to these points yet, but dammit I need to talk to her about them. Hahaha
MON 11:05 AM
How's she liking the game?
MON 11:05 AM
She loves it. Just wishes she had more time to play. :/
MON 11:12 AM
But she’s working on getting a new job so that’s nice!
MON 11:12 AM
Not as fun, but I'm glad she's working on that game.
MON 11:13 AM
I forgot to answer what I'm up to. There are no offspring in my house. I'm kind of shellshocked by the empty nest. I'm apply to jobs as well. There's a book I've had for months which I've not gotten through, and I need to do that. I have hundreds of browser tabs waiting for me to digest, 1400 tiddlers which need tagging, and I should probably do some cleaning.
MON 11:30 AM
No worries. And nice! We need to do a deep clean ourselves...
