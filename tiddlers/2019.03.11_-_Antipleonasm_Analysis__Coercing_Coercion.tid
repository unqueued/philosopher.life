!! Respond to the following gem:

It is the fundamental duty of the citizen to resist and to restrain the violence of the state. Those who choose to disregard this responsibility can justly be accused of complicity in war crimes, which is itself designated as ‘a crime under international law’ in the principles of the Charter of Nuremberg.

I'm in lurv, homefry.

Clearly, making sure our government wields coercion over us wisely is morally necessary. [[The Dialectic]] is right here. Violence comes in many [[dok]], and it can be foreign or domestic. I can understand being burned out, downtrodden, overwhelmed, and feeling radically underprepared against what feels like impossible odds. I cannot abide by apathy, indifference, relativism, and dark-triadicism.

I think people would be shocked if they understood the extent to which they have chosen to contribute to evil in the world, directly or as reactionaries. 

I've made this mistake too often. There are many humans who have unjustifiably suffered, directly or indirectly, and even died, indirectly, because of my choices. To some significant [[dok]], I am guilty. I've not been nearly political enough. I've not fought for what matters most nearly hard enough. I'm the hypocrite here. I am trying to make up for it.
