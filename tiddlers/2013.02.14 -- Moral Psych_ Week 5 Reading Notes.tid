2 - The Secret Joke of Kant’s Soul – Greene

“There is a substantial and growing body of evidence suggesting that much of what we do, we do unconsciously, and for reasons that are inaccessible to us”

Denies moral reasoning, claims moral rationalization.

Kant and Mill are explicit tips of implicit, psychology icebergs.

Cognitive/Emotional representations … only emotional representations have automatically triggered behavior responses or dispositions. Car representation. Avoiding and approaching them.

Which kinds of psychological processes (cognitive and/or emotional) are the basis of our two kinds of moral judgment (deontic and consequentialist)?

Greene thinks deontic is emotional while consequentialist is emotional.

Trolley and footbridge problems.

Crying baby/infanticide

Drowning/Donation



This explains why by-and-large people reject Singer’s consequentialist conclusion.



KEEP/LOSE Endowment of $10

Consequentialist Punishment/Retribution



Ultimatum game.



Education, HIGH-SES, less condemning, cognitive, westernization factor, more consequentialist



Hypnosis, lol.



Emotions are reliable, quick, and efficient responses to recurring situations; reasoning is unreliable, slow, and inefficient. Emotions are evolutionarily better in some respects.



Deontology is rationalization of your moral emotions or “cognitive” expression of your moral emotions?



Defending my family. I wish to subscribe to a weak thesis of pacifism on what I think are deontic reasons. I think I have amazing utilitarian reasons to defend my family, but deontically, I have conflicting reasons. What ought I do? I might give you a deontic reason not to harm someone. What would I do, I would defend my family by whatever means necessary.

There seems to be two kinds of deontic reasoning going on. A emotionally driven one…defend thy family…and a pacifist one, which seems deontic to me.

Maybe the pacifist thesis is just emotional though. It makes me feel bad to hurt others.

What about Kantian interpretations which focus upon our duties rather than our rights?





Moral intuitions are to be doubted, they are contingent, evolutionarily put in place, and not based upon reason.



Rationalist deontologists are in trouble because they can’t accept that emotional responses are the basis for moral truths.



“IS”/”OUGHT”
