FRI 10:53 AM
I should have used that time to finish my app for the sub teaching job. Lol
FRI 10:54 AM
I don't get to write like that often. Or ever. It was enjoyable. And the prompted thoughts from our conversation spilled.
FRI 10:55 AM
It's beautiful when it flows.
FRI 10:56 AM
It was enjoyable. Not a chore.
FRI 10:56 AM
But yes costly. Costly of time. And some thought.
FRI 10:56 AM
time is precious.
FRI 10:57 AM
Aye. It's a resource we have to spend wisely.
FRI 10:57 AM

FRI 11:01 AM
Well, I hope we build a beautiful spiral of a conversation together. We are lucky to have people worth spending our time on and vv.
FRI 11:01 AM
We are riding the downward spiral as Trent Reznor would say. But I hold precious the people I call friends along the way
FRI 11:03 AM
Which I had to define what u think a friend is this morning.
FRI 11:03 AM
What i
FRI 11:03 AM
Lol
FRI 11:03 AM
One of the few artists with lyrics I want to think about.
FRI 11:03 AM
Well good luck defining it! I'm still in search of a clean definition myself. A few properties stand out to me.
FRI 11:04 AM
It was intersting. And I used existing models. But indeed. A clean definition is not apparent.
FRI 11:05 AM
By the way, if you want, you can make your own wiki. It's not hard (and I'm happy to help). It's a single html file that has everything wrapped up inside it. You can stick it in the Resilio sync and it will automatically get sent to me (and anyone else you want to read it). It's encrypted, P2P, and fast.
FRI 11:07 AM
I like my Facebook secrete group.
FRI 11:12 AM
I hear that. I think most do.
FRI 11:13 AM
I ever tell you that I spoke with a guy who sold his startup for millions to FB and worked with them for a few years?
FRI 11:13 AM
