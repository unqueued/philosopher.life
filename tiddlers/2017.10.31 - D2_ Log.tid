I've done some random runs with the necro and sorc, but meh. I decided to give my javazon another try with fresh eyes. I really want a Homunculus for my necro, and Atma says NM Baal is likely my best bet for the Javazon. So, I did Baal for a bit since I needed the levels as well. The immune lightning souls made it untenable, but /players 8 was pretty sick xp into the low 70's, ofc.

 I eventually went to The Pits in Hell. She fucking crushes it. I found out how to handle immune lightning as well by jabbing with Demon Arch. I can wear my major gear as well now that I've jumped 15 levels. She clears faster than the necro while keeping up 350-400% MF (Necro beats that easily). I raised her to 80. XP slowed down considerably. I may try /players 2+ to push her further.

I didn't find much, although I grabbed a Ko rune and a 4 socket Flail (2x actually). One more rune (the rare one) and I have HOTO. The eth Troll's nest is absurd on her. I need to socket it for something delicious. It's obvious that I have 2 weapons that rock on mercs; either CB or Decrepify, whichever I need most. I want to MF with her for levels until I feel ready to push through for Matriarch status (and really, I'm most interested in the Anya resists and Hellforge). 

Brought Druid to 72, will probably bring him to 80. I should bring everyone to 80.
