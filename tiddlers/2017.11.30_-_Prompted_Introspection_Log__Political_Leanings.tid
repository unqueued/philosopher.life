title: 2017.11.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Political Leanings

!! What are you political views? Are you a liberal? republican? libertarian? ? Why?

Ah, Samwise, you strike again. I'm not even going to grammar nazi assault your<<ref "1">> (not that I have any room to speak). Do you even see what's missing in your question? You don't even have a Leftist stance presented as a possibility. Seldon, you are brainwashed.

I'm a Redpilled Leftist. 

As you might suspect, I have a lot of [[Self-Dialectic]].<<ref "2018.12.21">> I write often about my political views in [[Link Log]], [[/b/]], [[Realpolitik Speculation]], and many other places. I have a hard time not seeing the politicalness of life. 

Libertarians and I agree on some very significant points that people in the middle of the horseshoe/fish-hook, do not.

Libertarians, of course, are the normatively unacceptably egoist, psychopathic versions of Leftists. When I am charitable to both sides, I find that to be the only difference that matters. If the goal of the Libertarian behind the Veil of Ignorance is really going to be about preventing theft of their personal self-ownership rights and Hohfeldian entailments, then they would obviously choose decentralizing power and socialism as the answer to how we should construct basic structures of society. That is literally the minimally right-offending, maximally freedom producing government that is practically available to a world filled with varying degrees and kinds of psychopaths. Forgive me, I think they are responsible for their ignorance.

I can't define the word //liberal// for you. It might feel like a truism or appear nebulous. The people who call themselves liberals tend to have better initial arguments and reasons for their point of view than conservatives, however, I have found they really do sit on the same spectrum. I do think it's a slippery slope. 

Conservatives are either libertarians in disguise or retarded (or both).

I guess that makes me a Leftist, although I find many Leftists abhorrent on a number of issues (and they feel the same way about me). I suppose it is a good sign that we are splintered though; we've gathered around what really matters, even through our disagreement.

History is doomed to repeat itself, we're condemned to repeat ourselves (or whatever), and that's because the vast majority of people do not remember or apply the lessons from history. Basically, I have every right to dismiss the rest of you as crazy; it's a historical fact that I should.<<ref "2">>
