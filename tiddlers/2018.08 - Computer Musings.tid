!! Audit:

* I love how clean /home/h0p3 looks. Making a beautiful desktop and a home sometimes just pushes the ugliness one layer deeper, but othertimes it gives me a reason to organize.
* I'm glad I put in the legwork on massaging the snapshots. It made it possible for my daughter to get her work done without too much trouble.
* Xonsh has turned out to be more useful this month than usual. I regularly use the santizing script too. Love it!
* Music acquisition has taken forever!
* I'm very pleased to have my virtual machines running again.
* I think I fucked a pacman usage somewhere, since xonsh/pip got raped somewhere along the lines.
* Lots of laptop work, including my son's
* My chromebook is much better with the SSD upgrade as opposed to the tiny USB thumb drive.
