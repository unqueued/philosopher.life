title: 2018.12.23 - Self-Dialectic: Autocompletion

The spectre of automation is haunting me. I am worried about ceding any of my autonomy to it. Insofar as it is a mere instrument, I am fine with it. I have argued about this issue elsewhere, but I need to start forming an official position, a policy, a way to delineate with a rule-of-thumb (a principle which evolves to cover the exceptions as I stumble upon them). This is not an easy thing to do. There are so many moving parts and philosophical problems. I suppose I am developing my proto-AI ethics here. Insofar as AI is not a person, I do not engage in the [[T42T]] process with them. Even from the instruments, there is a profound attack vector against my autonomy.

How do I own this process and safely leverage "free" services and software? Wonderfully, I have shed the need for privacy in some crucial respects which buys me enough working space and material to use mainstream tooling! Self-ownership is part of the [[self-dialectic]].

So, one might be hesitant about autocompletion into [[infinigress]]. I have to trust it somewhere. I'm gonna just have to carefully wander it for now.
