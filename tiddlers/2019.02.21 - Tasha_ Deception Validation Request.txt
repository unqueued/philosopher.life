Ok so I know this sounds horrible but I know the office won’t do shit if I complain but - it’s driving me crazy that these people moved in and park that Acura in the spot we park in and it hasn’t moved for days? We have been waiting to see them to talk to them but the dip and dodge us- so I was going to take matters into my own hands and bring it to their attention that if the car isn’t being used on a daily park it across the street like comon or in the spot next to their other car on the other side. Not in ours :pensive: I dropped and busted food the other night trying to haul it across the street because My hands it just frustrates me

THU 12:02 PM
I'm sorry about the food. That sucks =(
THU 12:02 PM
Sigh
THU 12:02 PM
I know I’m an evil person it just doesn’t make sense that there’s no common courtesy
THU 12:03 PM
I mean our cars were there when they moved in - && it was fine the first few weeks and then it’s like oh well
THU 12:04 PM
I can appreciate your frustrations. I have no idea what to do about it.
THU 12:05 PM
Me either
THU 12:06 PM
I mean please tell me am I being controlling or having an unrealistic expectation?<<ref "2020.02.25-3">>
THU 12:07 PM
I’m like torn because everybody parks in the same spot. Why can’t they?

I think it makes sense to have parking spaces that are close to your home. I try not to violate that because that is what want too.
THU 12:13 PM
I recognize not everyone is as concerned with something that seems like common sense to me.
THU 12:14 PM
Yea
THU 12:15 PM
So, I agree with you on that. I usually have so many fundamental disagreements with people that I'm forced to spend my social capital on the biggest disagreements. This probably means I'm not an effective reasoner in your position.<<ref "2020.02.25-4">>
THU 12:15 PM
I mean I am puzzled
