Hey, how are you?

So, just wanted to say hello after all the software saga. 
Thank you, again, for your help!!
 
Ultimately, that laptop just doesnae have the juice to run Ableton. Ed was having an over-the-phone sort of tutorial with his producer mate in London, and the thing is just not coping. I dinnae ken what the processor/RAM is like in that thing, but it won't be good. That's one of the reasons I upgraded to this thing last year. (Albeit the Core i7 was nowhere near as fast as I thought it would be. Still, fucking lightspeed compared to the older one! haha)

Ed's decided that, while he'll probably have to invest time and money in purchasing/learning real computer/software/DAW stuff in the longer-run, he's only got a few months right now, and he doesnae want all of the creative impetus and energy sucked away and drained by constantly fighting with drivers and lag and compatibility issues and things, so he's getting some kind of external/portable mixing/sampling/sequencing thing that he's got more experience with and is more intuitive to use etc, and is going to do this project with that. 
His professional pal seems a bit disappointed as he is ALL about the computers but, anyway. He understands.

Most likely Ed will need to get himself a Mac, whenever all that stuff really goes forward, and I'm not getting involved in that. I ken Macs are far superior for media, basically, but still. I'm a word processor, for the most part, and Windows does me fine ðŸ˜‚

Anywhoo, my attempts to establish facebook access have failed, again. It was all legit/correct details (my step-dad's); every time I did something with that I connected from a USA-server; not really sure how they've figured it out.
Could it be something in the hardware/device itself that they've identified?

The annoying thing is I literally cannot open a 'legit' account, in my own name, because 1 - there are debt collectors in the states who would LOVE to track me down!! and 
2 - everything I said about how it won't let me verify with my real phone number, but there are no alternatives, so. Also, they want MY ID, and they ain't fucking getting that! How fucking creepy!!!!!

If you think of any way I might be able to get around that, let me know... I wondered, if I had someone else, like not me, not this device, set up something... maybe in their own name etc., but let me have the log-in details? But fuck, man. What a lot of hassle, just so I can see photos of people's brats.
What's that worth, right? ðŸ˜‰

(Reassure me, here. Your 'brats' are amongst those I care about ðŸ˜‚)

Anyways, I'll awa the noo.
Hope you're taking care of yourself, and each other.

GOOD LUCK WITH FINDING A PLACE TO LIVE, by the way!
And with finding some non-fuddy-new-england-cunts to hang out with when you get there!! hehehe
