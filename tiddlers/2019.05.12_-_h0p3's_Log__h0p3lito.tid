I've had a system fungal infection lately. I've had several, and this one was clearing up for the most part. The rest of my body felt good. My dick is standardly puffy because it gets used heavily, and the coloration seemed fine to me (but, I'm colorblind). It has been itchy though. 11:30am today, I hit the head, and my skin goes berserk: I balloon up on the spot (and it's all skin...no glans puffing up). 

I'm now deeply concerned because my penis has never done that before. I grab icepacks, take ibuprofen, and start searching the web. I call up my wife, have her come and look, she's horrified and demands we leave. We get to the ER, they took my history 3 times, 6 nurses and 2 doctors played with my swollen penis, and they say I should stay. They took a bunch of blood for cultures, pumped me full of broad spectrum antibiotics, antifungal meds, anti-inflammatory+painkiller, and advised me to pee or I'd get cathed or worse. Fuck.

I forgot I was in public, and said "Happy Mother's Day" to my wife as a joke. Apparently, that one was over-the-top for the nurses.

My brother [[JRE]] laughed his ass off with me, and he had dinner delivered to us. 

We had a complete [[Family Time]] minus walking. 

I'm going to be okay as long as it doesn't get worse.
