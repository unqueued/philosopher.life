That's the interesting part about being a traveler for both business and pleasure, I suppose: your goal is to rarely be home.

Yea this is true Este is headed off today to Florida! Then he’ll be in Nashville next week-
TUE 11:27 AM
Wow. That is a lot of traveling.

That’s what we do! Ultimately helping others do the same is a blessing :slightly_smiling_face:

Aside from my nannying that’s just my job if you will not that I absolutely hate nannying just rather do our business and make what I make in a month in a day!! Ultimately- I would say one day but that’s not a day of the week:grimacing: let’s say in the next 3 years god willing :pray::relieved:
TUE 11:33 AM
That would be outstanding. I hope it comes sooner rather than later.
TUE 11:36 AM
Yes! Where there is no vision people will perish! It gives us hope, life, something to look forward to, and we definitely meet good people :heart::pray:

I think I shouldn’t. Honestly I believe what you watch, read, and listen to impacts your life. I appreciate you wanting to share it with me but right now it’s something I don’t need to feed my mind- if that makes sense.
TUE 1:14 PM
I am surprised. I gotcha.
TUE 1:15 PM
I hope it’s not a offending surprise:grimacing:
TUE 1:16 PM
No, lol.
TUE 1:16 PM
I suppose I don't understand why you think it's not something you should feed your mind. I usually look at narratives as being incredibly valuable to how I think about and shape my own story.
TUE 1:17 PM
Exactly- and I don’t plan on nannying forever nor do I want to relate it to slavery or the history of it. I hope you can understand that is not the position I play nor need to understand because I’m more valuable than that!!
TUE 1:20 PM
I agree you are more valuable than that, and I look forward to you not being a nanny.
TUE 1:22 PM
Me too:bangbang:
TUE 1:22 PM
You all having a good week?
