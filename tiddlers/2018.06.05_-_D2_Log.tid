It's interesting to see that I still have enormous incentives to shop. In SC, I wouldn't really give a shit, but I need every ounce of strength I can muster at the moment. I can't just brute force zerg my way to high end content and race to farm Hell Meph with a thousand deaths. 

Picked up a +2 nec, +3 mage wand. Neat! I'm very pleased to have the cash for it.

Made it to 47 and the full staff in A2. Might Merc is amazing! =) He desperately needs a weapon.
