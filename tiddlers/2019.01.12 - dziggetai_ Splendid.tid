```
This is the beginning of your direct message history with @Shp.
[4:36 PM] Shp: Hello! I'm dziggetai, if we can exchange a few messages here that'd be splendid.
January 13, 2019
[12:37 AM] Shp: Just above this one.
[12:37 AM] h0p3: heyas :smiley:
[12:38 AM] Shp: since we're talking about this - your detective work was spot on up until all the social media links.(edited)
[12:40 AM] h0p3: Noted! Yeah, mostly guesswork.
[12:40 AM] Shp: I'm usually hiding online
[12:40 AM] h0p3: I have been there, homie.
[12:41 AM] Shp: I find your transparency very interesting but scary
[12:41 AM] h0p3: Ha, me too!
[12:44 AM] Shp: been thinking about asking for a sort of pseudonym for myself so that I can be  hidden in plain view on your wiki, but I'm having conflicting thoughts.
[12:47 AM] Shp: But for now I decided to let it go. There are more important matters to discuss.
[12:47 AM] Shp: I might return to this as it makes me nervous :smiley:
[12:47 AM] h0p3: You will let me know if you change your mind.
[12:52 AM] Shp: On a more important topic: I can be inconsiderate. Especially by your standards. I do my best to pay attention, I try my best, but I often fail. I apologize for that.
[12:52 AM] h0p3: I have not seen that in you, lol. To be fair: I fail to live up to my own standards.
[12:53 AM] h0p3: Sometimes my {[[Principles]]} are my {[[Dreams]]}.
[12:53 AM] Shp: It can be seen in my letter to you - it is doesn't express enough respect towards you.
[12:54 AM] Shp: I started to write you a new letter but I don't want to disturb your progress on the craft.
[12:56 AM] h0p3: Fear not! I do not feel disrespected at all. I appreciate how much time and thought you put into your letter. As I said, I'm still thinking about it. You've definitely got me scratchin' my head; I don't know how to answer your question satisfactorily. I'll try to pull out a glimpse of the history of my (poor!) reasoning on the topic so far.
[12:57 AM] h0p3: There are a couple letters I must address before I can rightfully address yours. I owe [[kickscondor]] and [[T-Money]] serious answers asap.  I am grateful that you are willing to give me time to answer.
[12:58 AM] Shp: funny thing is that at the time it seemed like I took way too much time writing that letter, but now that I know you take it so seriously (which is beyond my wildest dreams) I think I didn't spend enough time on it after all.(edited)
[12:59 AM] Shp: I can't think of words to express my gratitude for the time you spend with  your response.
[1:00 AM] h0p3: It is a pleasure to meet you in the desert, nomad. :smiley: I'm grateful to have community.
[1:03 AM] Shp: I am in conflict - I feel like I want to have a personal conversation with you, but I don't want to "waste" the opportunity to learn from you. This is one of the things I find to be rude about myself.
[1:03 AM] h0p3: It is my opinion that we will learn from each other by having profoundly personal conversations with each other.
[1:04 AM] h0p3: That is how I intend to open and close that letter.
[1:06 AM] Shp: I am trying as hard as I can to be patient :smiley:
[1:11 AM] Shp: I was thinking about sharing my wiki with you. Only you. Haven't come to any conclusion about whether to do so or not, but there are two important questions: 
Would you be interested in it?
Can I trust you that you'd keep it to yourself? (I trust you will do so if you say you will.)
[1:11 AM] h0p3: It will help me to be able to see your wiki, btw. I will be able to think about what you are thinking that way.
[1:11 AM] h0p3: lol
[1:12 AM] h0p3: yeah
[1:12 AM] Shp: haha :smile:
[1:12 AM] h0p3: I will need some explicit ground rules here. My brother [[AIR]] has a wiki. I speak of it. I talk indirectly about its contents. There are lines of privacy I aim to preserve for him.
[1:14 AM] h0p3: Imho, it would be better for you to instead of showing me your private wiki to instead find a way to build a process to automatically export a public facing portion of your private wiki.
[1:14 AM] h0p3: This is, in fact, what [[Sphygmus]] does.
[1:14 AM] h0p3: This also enables you to communicate with everyone, not just me!
[1:15 AM] Shp: I did consider that.
[1:16 AM] Shp: But I would like you to see me as I see you.
[1:16 AM] Shp: Not that my wiki is even the same species as yours
[1:18 AM] Shp: Its empty for the most part. But that emptiness tells a lot - like how much time I waste with trying to find the best arrangement of plugins instead of getting some work done.
[1:18 AM] h0p3: I know that pain, lol.
[1:20 AM] Shp: I will first try to make a public portion of it and see how it goes. I might show you my whole wiki regardless. We will return to establishing rules at that time.
[1:21 AM] h0p3: I appreciate that. I think your contributing yourself to the public sphere will be a gift to everyone who will think carefully with and about you. I have experienced that vertigo significantly.
[1:22 AM] Shp: Its getting very late at your end. Do you ever sleep? :smiley:
[1:22 AM] h0p3: I wish. lol.
[1:23 AM] Shp: My mind is running in circles, it is probably best to engage with you in more thought-trough letters. But I do enjoy the quickness of IM
[1:23 AM] h0p3: Aye. Time and a place for everything. I'm still figuring that out for [[hyperconversations]].
[1:23 AM] Shp: lol
[1:24 AM] Shp: I am yet to understand the concept of hyperconversations
[1:24 AM] Shp: I was just writing this as you responded, hence the lol
[1:24 AM] h0p3: lol
[1:24 AM] Shp: :smile:
[1:27 AM] h0p3: I think it can be seen in my correspondence with [[Sphygmus]] and [[kickscondor]], but I also think the qualia of experiencing first-hand cannot be duplicated by simply seeing it from the outside. You should read through both of them (perhaps even in timeline) to see what I mean. It may help to read their sites alongside (though, I try to do a reasonable job of preserving context). I think it's a semantically rich experience.
[1:29 AM] h0p3: I'm pointing at hyperobjects something like this sense: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_ontology
Object-oriented ontology
In metaphysics, object-oriented ontology (OOO) is a 21st-century Heidegger-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects. This is in contrast to what it calls the "anthropocentrism" of Kant's Copernican Rev...
[1:29 AM] Shp: I only found the conversations after I sent my e-mail, don't ask me how I managed to do that. But in my defense your wiki s a true rabbithole, there is no end to it.
[1:29 AM] h0p3: It's also a complete mess, lol. I'll get there, one day.
[1:36 AM] Shp: I'm pretty sure I'm misunderstanding this, but it is very similar something I've been thinking about for years: we're just objects, not even objects, just software, there is no high value in that.  Even the least important thing in the universe has the same value we have. Any value we have is self-imposed
[1:37 AM] h0p3: That appears to be  a conclusion OOO draws.
[1:37 AM] h0p3: I admire it's attempt at humility.
[1:38 AM] h0p3: They would not like what I have to say. I have a differentiationist streak in me.
[1:40 AM] Shp: I occasionally recognize principles like the law of large numbers in people's reasoning, you're doing this on a different level :smiley: I didn't even have to talk about those thoughts and you showed me smarter ppl have already thought about it.(edited)
[1:44 AM] Shp: a question i have that fits this medium is: how much time / day do you spend on your wiki?
[1:44 AM] h0p3: I will be interested to see how you perform/engage in your method/pursuit of philosophy. You clearly care about finding what matters (and I mean that as high praise).
[1:44 AM] h0p3: That varies.
[1:44 AM] h0p3: It's difficult to know what doesn't count as time on my wiki sometimes.
[1:45 AM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Link%20Log:%5B%5BLink%20Log%5D%5D
[1:45 AM] h0p3: Take that [[Leet]] log for instance. I spend copious amounts of time curating, reading, and digesting the material I put into it.
[1:46 AM] Shp: don't expect much - I am a newborn baby(edited)
[1:46 AM] h0p3: Oh, don't worry...if you go through my daily snapshots, you will see that my wiki was a tiny pile of shit for a long time. It took quite while for it to grow into a big pile, lol.
[1:47 AM] h0p3: My opinion is that you should devote as much time as you can spare.
[1:47 AM] h0p3: On a bad day, that is less than an hour for me.
[1:47 AM] h0p3: On a really bad day, it is 18-20 hours for me.
[1:47 AM] h0p3: Lol
[1:48 AM] Shp: :smile:
[1:49 AM] Shp: that is quite a range
[1:49 AM] h0p3: It is fair to say I have an obsessive personality at times.
[1:50 AM] h0p3: And, unfortunately, I don't always have time to accomplish everything I hope to in my wiki.
[1:50 AM] Shp: I can't find your daily snapshots
[1:50 AM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Ways%20to%20Connect%20to%20this%20Wiki:%5B%5BWays%20to%20Connect%20to%20this%20Wiki%5D%5D
[1:51 AM] h0p3: I saw that you are careful with backups on the forums. You will thank yourself for keeping daily snapshots many times over.
[1:54 AM] Shp: see: inconsiderate. I've been on this tiddler, but I didn't see this or forgot about it.
[1:54 AM] h0p3: There is too much to see, interpret, and remember. Don't worry about it.
[1:55 AM] h0p3: The search function will also be useful to you. The [[Search of h0p3]] is far off, but I'm hoping we will get there.

[1:59 AM] h0p3: Yeah, probably. I believe it is //Vault://{[[Connect]]} though.
[2:06 AM] Shp: I can't seem to get to the snapshots. https://bitbucket.org/m6ram/h0p3s-wiki/src/0c75d8e4959351fac960ea0e5bd830b679f9a370?at=master this has only one
[2:06 AM] Shp: oh there is dropbox, I didn't see that
[2:06 AM] Shp: and there they are
[2:06 AM] Shp: don't mind me
[2:22 AM] Shp: this is incredible, with this power I might start to understand your wiki
[2:22 AM] Shp: I can't believe I didn't see this previously.
[2:23 AM] h0p3: I will slowly convince you I'm insane one day. Lol.
[2:24 AM] Shp: https://data.whicdn.com/images/300929187/large.jpg

[2:25 AM] h0p3: lol /high-5
[2:53 AM] Shp: I might just end up learning  how to bond and have meaningful relationships from your wiki.
[2:54 AM] h0p3: :smiley:
[2:54 AM] h0p3: That's one of my axioms!
[2:55 AM] h0p3: It has been a hell of a journey this year.
[3:05 AM] Shp: I both love and hate that there is seemingly no end to this madness :smiley:
[3:06 AM] Shp: sadly my wiki didn't evolve as much as it should've in 2018
[3:07 AM] h0p3: It will. Give it time.
[3:07 AM] h0p3: I bet you are being too hard on yourself.
[3:11 AM] Shp: that's only partly true
[3:11 AM] Shp: seems like you really don't sleep
[3:13 AM] h0p3: I need to. [[Sphygmus]] is quietly having the same problem on the other line. I'm heading to bed now after both my doctors have advised me.
[3:13 AM] h0p3: See you on the flip side.
[3:14 AM] Shp: good night!
