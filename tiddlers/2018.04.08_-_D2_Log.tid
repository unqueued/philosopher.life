MOTHERFUCKING JAH RUNE!!! That is insane!!! I was so worried about not losing it, I saved and exited after looting it. I'm riiiiiich bitch! I'm going to save for Enigma. Enigma changes the game radically. It is the single best piece of armor in the game without a doubt. I'm one Ber away. I can do it!

Turns out my necro Baal runs have paid off. Since I can't trade, I have to consider what 100 hours of Countess runs nets me vs 100 hours of Mephisto nets me. It turns out that the Jah rune is by far the most valuable item I've ever had drop for me, and that you could combine everything I've had drop beside the Jah, and the Jah is more valuable (in terms of time).
