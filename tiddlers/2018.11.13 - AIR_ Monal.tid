TUE 7:45 PM
Lol =)
TUE 7:46 PM
What you been using it for?
TUE 7:46 PM
I’ll show you
TUE 7:49 PM
6:45 pm was talking with Marty and Cameron about all I basically did today was clean because there was nothing to prep. Come to find out that the Tuesday 2 o’clock meeting chef DS goes to he said he had to leave early because two people called out sick and he needed to “help prep the lines”.   If I the sous chef didn’t have anything to prep than he shire as heck doesn’t just another lie he uses to not have to work
TUE 7:49 PM
Chef did not inform me or anyone one th me kitchen that DB and the board members would be waking through the kitchen tonight. I’m glad I had everything clean and ready and that I didn’t clean the floors yet because of the hazard off them slipping and falling.  

Why wasn’t I told?!
TUE 7:49 PM
Neat. =)
TUE 7:50 PM
Iv been using to take notes though out the day  about what’s happened
TUE 7:50 PM
That way I can just post it into the wiki
TUE 7:50 PM
Yup.
TUE 7:50 PM
And I also did a stop watch on each time chef entered the kitchen I would time him till he left. Mine has a lap feature on it so I can stop it and start a new lap to get each point he actually spent in side
TUE 7:52 PM
I’m sure I sound crazy doing this
TUE 7:53 PM
But I want to confirm that I’m not with this
TUE 7:53 PM
Lol, naw.
TUE 7:53 PM
I want to warn you that this evidence will not be useful in front of a psychopath.
TUE 7:53 PM
It is useful to you though.
TUE 7:53 PM
That way you aren't being gaslit.
TUE 7:53 PM
Oh yeah I know I do t plan on showing him. I want proof for myself and my sanity
TUE 7:55 PM
And to know  I am justified in doing this  change
TUE 7:58 PM
