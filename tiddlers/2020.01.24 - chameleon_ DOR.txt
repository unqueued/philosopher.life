11:55 PM] chameleon: I want to understand [[DOR]], have you written anything specifically on the topic or is it something I'll have to figure out?
[12:05 AM] h0p3: I have nothing production ready.
[12:05 AM] chameleon: hmm
[12:05 AM] chameleon: fair enough
[12:05 AM] h0p3: There's plenty in the wiki to reason about on the topic.
[12:06 AM] h0p3: What draws you to that one?
[12:06 AM] chameleon: I deconstruct a lot
[12:06 AM] chameleon: but I don't seem to reconstruct much :wink:
[12:07 AM] h0p3: I think that is a fair assessment.
[12:09 AM] h0p3: This is one of my problems with postmodernism. It takes the modernist's pursuit of certainty and perfects it, taking those principles to the Nth degree, leaving nothing.
[12:09 AM] h0p3: Buddhism, particularly the Shock Koan approach, has that disintegration too.
[12:15 AM] h0p3: You sometimes joke about Saint Kant with respect to his moral philosophy, but many consider his epistemology to be the Copernican Revolution in philosophy (where we are all now forced to respond). What comes after Kant is continually optimized deconstruction. No one seems to be able to stop speaking about what is called the ineffable or attempting to experience or reason about the noumena. Deconstruction of metaphysics (sometimes couched as The Linguistic Turn) is the popular approach since Kant.
[12:16 AM] h0p3: Metamodernism is hoped to be the fitting response to the dialectic between modernism and postmodernism (which seems to cycle again and again in historical discourses).
[12:17 AM] h0p3: I take that {[[axiom]]} to be a metamodern one, a [[hope]]ful one (it might actually be deduced and not an axiom itself, but I'm playing it safe for now).
[12:19 AM] h0p3: It tends to be much easier to destroy something than to create. A lot of academic philosophers just do that with their work. Even their creations are just sequences for self-destructing.
[12:23 AM] h0p3: This problem runs deep. If you are going to be fair and thorough in deconstruction, you don't even get back to reality. It's functionally no different than truth relativism. It's not easy to put down tentpegs which survive the desert storms.
[12:24 AM] chameleon: damn, lots to think about here
[12:24 AM] chameleon: I think I need to kopipe this to my wiki ...
[12:24 AM] chameleon: more and more I'm like "y'know, if I'm not careful, I'm just going to be replicating h0p3 here"
[12:25 AM] chameleon: I thought about doing a [[Find The Others]], even!
[12:25 AM] h0p3: I saw that.
[12:26 AM] h0p3: To be fair though, even I am replicating the work of others. [[FTO]] is an extremely ancient idea. I'm ripping that straight out of hospitality norms, cultures, and moral reasoning.
[12:27 AM] h0p3: I think our work is unique but mostly unoriginal (and, I'm proud of the fact that my work isn't original: standing on the shoulders of giants).
[12:28 AM] chameleon: hehe, I wrote [[Guestright]] about hospitality
[12:28 AM] chameleon: partially it's to explain to the Abyssal why I bow my head respectfully when my relatives pray, despite my not-so-private disdain for christianity
[12:29 AM] h0p3: Yes, I think [[Guestright]] is pointing directly to it! I like that one a lot.
[12:33 AM] h0p3: I totally see that too. I would even argue that you extend that exceptional hospitality to me many times.
[12:39 AM] h0p3: I always want to reach out and tell you how much disdain I have for those who call themselves Christians as well. Even most of those who call themselves Christian in my life do not discuss the topic with me often. The novel-letter to [[DeathOfRobinhood]] has been an important marker. I am, of course, interested in your thoughts on it.
[12:39 AM] chameleon: it's intimidating! I've only skimmed a skimming of it
[12:44 AM] h0p3: I do my best not to push you hard here, btw. I don't know if you know that. I'm merciless with most people in this space, but I respect that you actually have the courage to wade into the deep end here so openly, publicly, and vulnerably. Even when I disagree with you, I hope to kindle your fire because I respect your method. I wish everyone did it; it's so fucking hard to do.
[12:47 AM] chameleon: there's the risk with something constructed autodidactically, that if it's pushed too hard at an early stage, the whole thing will collapse
[12:47 AM] chameleon: maybe I need to work on my foundations :wink:
[12:48 AM] chameleon: (thank you by the way. I am honored to call you senpai)
[12:50 AM] h0p3: I can appreciate that problem, I would argue. I cannot say that my own foundations are well-developed (mine sit in shambles, imho). Idealists hold themselves to a high standard (often into skepticism), and we both are going to have structures collapse and experiments fail. This is why [[DOR]] is so important. Don't give up.
[12:51 AM] h0p3: Sometimes, I think [[DOR]] is related to: [[Do It For Her]].
[12:52 AM] chameleon: it may well be, interesting connection!
[12:52 AM] chameleon: do it for her is existential, in some sense
