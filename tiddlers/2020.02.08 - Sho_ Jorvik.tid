fucking tossers

week was okay. got a bit of work done. starting to get excited about gang hame next week! weather-permitting, we should be back in caravan for 2 days before we head doon to angle-land
Feb 8 7:34am
nae real plans. doing sweet FA today. a guy we met w hile extras on that film, local young-ish guy who was on the crew, he and ed struck up a friendship so he's comin roond tomorra afternoon for a bit. I think they'll probably jam/make noise. Ed is almost never off his bass/pedal-board ... among the reasons i'm looking forward to the caravan where it isnae an option... lol but this dude is a toker so, phew! wow! SO RARE that we can be honest/comfortable/ourselves around people. anyways, he's apparently a bit connected music-wise, too; his brother has some project and they opened for someone big in Glasgow last year, I cannae mind the details. Anyways, all that combined makes Ed excited

He's still convinced we'll 'find oor folk on the island', but I really doubt it to be honest. But i dinnae care. I didnae come here to meet people. I came here tae get the fuck awa from as many as possible!

that said, going to Jorvik for the Heilung stuff in a few weeks... I've been preparing my own inner mantra:

I am no longer the sad loser looking for her home.
I am the hermit who's been dragged oot her hebridean cave and isnae entirely pleased aboot it! 

:D
Feb 8 7:37am
how are you?
Feb 8 7:38am
We have gotten what we really needed at the DMV, but it cost us $500. Lol. [[AA]]oyed at being told incorrect information so many times and paying for their mistakes.

Sounds excellent for ed. Hopefully, you can get high AF too.
