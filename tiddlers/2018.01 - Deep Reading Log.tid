!! Audit:

* I'm having problems with transclusions. At the end of the day, I can always reverse engineer them through searches. It is better to have a final product I like and make sure I'm being productive than to worry about this shit.
* I'm proud of having taken the time to do deep reading again. It might not be great, but it's what I've got. Good job, homie!
* I have learned a lot. These books have been quite an experience.
* I've been selectively diligent. Some books don't really seem to merit it, particularly when they are confirming my bias.
