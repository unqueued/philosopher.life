title: 2017.11.05 - Retired: Prompted Introspection Log

!! About:

Where I question or prompt myself with thought and respond empathically. When it gets hairy, pretend your mortal enemy, Samwise Gamgee, prompted you. When you want to be explicit (yeeeaaaah), pretend you are trying to convince Lady Melisandre. 

Also, you might get to know me here.

!! Principles:

Sometimes I feel like I need a can-opener to pry myself open. Writing prompts force me to say something about a topic. It can be recreational and useful at the same time. Admittedly, these questions tend to be philosophical. I sprawl all over the place, and I ask more questions than I answer. That's okay though. This is just part of the mind-mapping process.

It is my hypothesis that many of the prompts I've answered thus far remind me strongly of "Sunday School" questions. The teacher might gather us together and ask generic existential questions, and we'd have to formulate intelligent and socially acceptable responses. It was a form of conditioning. We were expected to think as they did. My questions and answers were often received poorly, dismissed, or misunderstood. Par for the course. Thankfully, here I get to say what I think since I'm answering them for myself. I won't always pretend I'm the one asking the questions though. A dialectic, like the Socratic method, tends to bring out the best in me.

Sometimes I'm just talking to myself directly. Other times, I will have a more adversarial approach to these prompts. When I'm in the mood, for whatever, reason, I will respond to particular prompts as if that eternal asshole, Samwise Gamgee, had asked me to respond to these prompts. 

I hate Samwise Gamgee; may he burn in hell.<<ref "1">> 

Hostility allows my guttural instincts to take over, to let loose, to fly, and once in a while, it is a useful way for me to force myself to answer carefully, to pick apart everything, to see the outlines. In many ways, I was good at academic philosophy because I was at mental war.<<ref "2">>

Eventually, I will have this automated. I will make it so I'm asked good questions with minimal bias. Until then, go fish:

!! Dreams:

* Ideabag
** If you were dictator of the world, country, state, county, city, neighborhood, family, and any other archetypal governmental contexts (feel free to use lateral thinking in naming these contexts), what would you do? How would you lead? 
** Why don't you follow philosophy like someone standardly interested in it? When you are obsessed with something, you usually enjoy reading every little thing about it. You don't do that with philosophy. Why not?
** Can you speak to the relationship between Moral Excellence, Excellence of Personhood, Homo Sapien Excellence, etc.? For example, it seems completely possible that the pursuit of morality taken to maximum excellence will drive a person crazy. I legitimately think that people who are sane aren't trying hard enough to be moral.
