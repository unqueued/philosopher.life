*** You don't understand what this requires. If you did, you would disagree with it, I fear. So much IP on the line and they will protect that at all costs. I hate to tell you that even the poor windows we have into the creation of these blackboxes will happen behind closed trade secret doors, and unless you are willing to make radical shifts against capitalism, this isn't going to change.

*** Nobody believed me during the primaries. I kept pointing out that: (A) the DNC and press were rigging against Sanders (that those in power would never let him win), and (B) Donald Trump was going to win POTUS (even before the primaries were over). I am disgusted by those who call themselves liberal or DNC supporters. You all don't even see what counts as Left.
