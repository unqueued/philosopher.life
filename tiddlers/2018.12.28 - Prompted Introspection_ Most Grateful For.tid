title: 2018.12.28 - Prompted Introspection: Most Grateful For

!! What are you most grateful for?

What timeslice of me are we talking about? There is a [[gfwiwcgws]] consideration here as well. Currently, I'm super grateful that my brother [[JRE]] and his [[SO]], Rebecca, have traveled to visit us. This is awesome! It's wonderful to have the opportunity to see them (I maybe get 10 days out of the year with them at best). I am grateful to have [[others]] in my life that I love and that love me.
