title: 2018.04.10 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Cheating Friend

!! What would you do if you saw a friend cheating–report it, confront the friend, nothing–and why?

Cheating on what, given what context, i.e. [[gfwiwcgws]]? I need the particulars to give you a better answer. 

Among those humans I have met, I find myself exceptionally detail-oriented in the distinctions I draw between mere convention and the moral law. As an autist, it is perhaps more natural for me to question the value or necessity of a human norm, especially since I don't innately feel moved by them or understand them affectively in the ways that neurotypicals might.

If they are cheating against a standard that I do not think is morally valuable, and especially when that "cheating" is actually in virtue of the moral law itself, I am likely to provide a positive comment about it. I like to see people think outside the box. 

If they are "sticking it to the man," even when I don't fully agree with it, I can empathize. I may even smirk in some cases.

If they are cheating in such a way that it only harms them, I may set it aside. If I see it is a habit, assuming I've collected the social capital and find it worth spending, I may comment on it.

Cheating that endangers or harms others without proper justification is where I am forced to act, intervene, etc.

Unfortunately, I'm going to pull an Aristotle here and tell you that I can't tell you what fits without having all the details. Generalizing and particularizing this into principles beyond the [[The Categorical Imperative]] is likely a matter of habituating virtuous perception.
