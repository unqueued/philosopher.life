* Dessert, of course. So hungry.
* We've not had Lasagna in a very long time. Last entry appears 2 years ago (that sounds wrong to me).
** Quite a treat for us. It's rare that we go for it instead of pizza when we are able to go for dairy.
* House needs some cleaning. We will probably do that instead of school tomorrow. [[k0sh3k]] wants to do a virtual tour? Ok. I need to hide all my socks.
* Link Log would be cool, homie.
* Think you'll finally dive back into letters.
** Time to start pulling material for quote and reply.  
*** iframed storyriver of Acks?
**** I want to point to things and say: I'm moved by that. 
* Continue to be perfectly insane. You are a madman. 
** I challenge you to hug someone who you aren't related to. Like, triple-dog dare you. Lol.
* Also, never forget, you were born for def poetry. It's your one purpose in life. Go for it.
