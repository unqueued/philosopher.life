title: 2019.09.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Cool It

* Woke at 10
** So fucking hot in my home. Not even in the same league as Thailand. New Orleans saw worse as well. We dealt. Global warming prep, right?
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* My offspring were on task
* Dialectures
** I love how we lounge. 
** Made more interesting by our repairman.
*** Confirmed my opinions about the corp. Knew nothing of Johnny (who was likely let go for his Parkinson's).
* Work on AC and the downstairs of this tiny townhome is at least livable.
** With this kind of heat, I need to be more lenient on my offspring.
* Read
** No writing though, as usual, you lazy fucking pansy.
* Fixing swap problems.
* Work
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
** Only thing I hate about sex is that we don't get to talk (few things turn me into a silent beast), otherwise perfeck. I //need// to know how her day is going. Shower is my chance. Very lucky.
* Repairmanmanmanmanman (thank you, Kel) brought an AC unit for the upstairs that fails. Just heats. Solid thermodynamics lesson for le chillun today.
* Ribs, potatoes, drunk off my ass.
** Finally. 2 beers and heavy bloody mary ftw.
* WoW
** Dailies, trying to bot for my bro (ran into a weird bug), selling. I'm still stabilizing my classes at this point. I've not yet hit the point where only raiding is the correct option for progress. Hopefully, I'll get to a PvP spec I respect. It's extremely hard with so limited information. Only so much can be reverse engineered from logs, parses, screencaps, and even vids.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2
** Noice. Keep it up, homie.
