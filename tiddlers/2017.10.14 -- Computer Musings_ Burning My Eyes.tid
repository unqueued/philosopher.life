title: 2017.10.14 -- Computer Musings: Burning My Eyes

I have spent much time trying to prevent my screen from being so damn bright and flashy. There are many tricks and customizations. One of my favorite is the //Deluminate// plugin for Chromium-based browsers. As long as you use it religiously, it converts the web into something far easier on the eyes, particularly in the dark.

Unfortunately, it started flashing a scroll-bar at the bottom. This is beyond annoying. It is unusable for me. After trying many things, I found a solution:

# Goto `chrome://flags/` and enable Overlay Scrollbar.

Also, it's fucking beautiful. I love the loss of the scrollbar until mouseover.

Now, if only I could find a way to prevent chromium screen flashing: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=470669.
