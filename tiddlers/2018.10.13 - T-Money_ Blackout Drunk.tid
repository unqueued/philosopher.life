How's it going?

 Life's pretty good man. Work some overtime today at work. It's nice to make a little extra money. Had a wild night Thursday night. A co-worker of 15 years is leaving for another job. So of course we threw him a going-away party at a bar. Unfortunately my tendencies for binge drinking overtook my rational thought of only having a few beers. Thank goodness I had a friend who also lives in Somerset drive me home.

 Still in the doghouse a little with the wife. But I didn't go to jail, I didn't get in a fight, as far as I know I'm still cool with all my co-workers. I can't tell you if I had a good time I blacked out. Pretty normal for my binge drinking. LOL. I do recall someone telling me you're drinking my tea quick T-Money you might want to slow down. I said sure of course. So each time I went to the restroom on the return back to the patio Kama I would stop and get a double shot at the bar before making my way back. LOL

 May convince my daughter to jump on the bango and wife on the fiddle. We'd be set.

 My best friend and I went on a fishing trip weekend before last. Found a cabin in the middle of nowhere east TN on the clinch River. We had 5 guitars up there! And more alcohol than a man should ever consume.

 Samantha is much more into singing and dancing I let her strum as well, but she will get bored quickly. We made a  usic video awhile back. I will have to send it to you when I'm on my pc.
