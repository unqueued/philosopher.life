title: Life of Fred: Liver (Intermediate Series)

Tons of ratios, percentages, etc. I showed them how to cross-multiply and why I think of problems in that way. My son is still struggling, but that's totally cool. He gets the vast majority of the problems correct, but there are a class of fractions problems that he can't quite get (and, even after inspection, I can't figure out why). I've tried to show him, but I think it will have to wait. We don't officially hit the Fractions books for another couple days. I'm hoping it will click then (and it's okay if it is doesn't).

The book spawned some good conversations. I especially agree with this professor's understanding of the telos of education (he gets plenty wrong on existential and ethical fronts, but not this one). 

Long division and multiplication. It's beginning to click with them why I'm pressing for memorized mastery in some departments. 

We had several kinds of geometry concepts show up. I was very pleased to talk about it with them. I think they are going to have a lot of fun in geometry. 

More telescoping on functions.

3 books until Pre-algebra. We're moving at a great pace. I've been told the Pre-Algebra series are a completely different wall for students and parents. I don't have the zeroth book on Physics yet (I assume this was made because of so many complaints about the original two). I have glanced through the other books.

The Biology pre-al book obviously doesn't want to talk about evolution (jesus, people). The mathematician, yet again, does not describe symbolic logic correctly (I won't be using his logic book, clearly; I'm going to stay with Barwise and Etchemendy). His understanding of implication is...awful. There are "Bridges" in the book that look like practice walls for mastery. It's obvious this is going to take a lot more time. Even the reading has less bullshit in it, and the scientific information is going to require more work. 

Honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the mix. I like application, but this seems to be trying to teach two different subjects at once. In any case, at least there are several such books. It's going to drive home the point of mathematics being the language of science without a doubt.

The Economics pre-al book comes loaded with plenty of bias. Jesus. Well, at least I will have the chance to debunk several assumptions and myths it attempts to propagate.
