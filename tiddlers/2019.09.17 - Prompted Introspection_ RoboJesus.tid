title: 2019.09.17 - Prompted Introspection: RoboJesus

!! Who is your favorite hero of fiction?

I am shocked that I can instantly come up with an answer to this question. I can barely define hero, and I'm woefully illiterate. It's a picture of optimism, joy, curiosity, and idealization which seems partially attainable:

//Saint R. Daneel Olivaw//

I have read that universe twice (though some pieces many times). I should probably do it again here soon enough, preferably with my offspring.<<ref "i">> Even when I disagree with this character, I hold him in such high regard. [[TPK]] is modeled after him. I am, of course, an insane person. Call me one of them silly transhumanist fucktards, techno-optimists in this weird case, someone who believes technology can actually be instrumentally necessary to solving our fundamental crises (which is almost guaranteed not going to happen), and so on and so forth; I'm utter garbage, I know. This robot is [[The Golden Rule]] embodied so strongly for me. He's so fucking pure. He's like RoboJesus to me. That's how you know it's fiction.
