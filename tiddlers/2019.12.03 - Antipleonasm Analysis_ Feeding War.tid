title: 2019.12.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Feeding War

Perhaps not always. Peace can be achieved, and [[hope]]fully on a global and permanent scale. This is a valuable warning about doing your best to peacefully resolve necessary conflicts. Escalation can be so expensive, and it's not always worth the price. There are cases in which we are morally obligated to engage in it though. 

I think one of the clearest examples of this would be the United States; it's largely a nation of warfare, and I'd argue it largely always has been. I did not grow up understanding just how many wars my nation engaged in (it was a form of war on the US population too), and it's still dizzying.

Also, it can't feed on itself exactly, right? Or, if so, there is only war as The Totality. Saints Hegel and Marx saw war, or something like it, in practically everything, so it might be important to try to isolate war-ness. If this is merely about conflict or difference (which can be welded together), well, there's no escaping the process of sublation (but even peace fits the bill). War, however, seems to have other connotations. It's violent, coercive, dominative, and has a tendency to be improperly restrained. It reminds me of the sports quote, "Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing." Warfare merely for the sake of warfare is immoral, and that sort of war is something this [[gem]] aims to warn us about too imprecisely. I suppose the concision tradeoff is part of the reason it made its way through history to me.
