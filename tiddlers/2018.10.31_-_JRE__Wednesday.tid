title: 2018.10.31 - JRE: Wednesday

My brother had a long day at work. He's no longer the temp foreman. He came home to the social worker. They are moving Raylan back to his family next Wednesday. It felt like he had a thousand emotions running through him. He's gotta be torn up inside. I hope he finds relief, some normalcy. I hope he can take it easy. I hope he and Rebecca can recover together. I hope they don't place a baby with them for another year or two. This has been traumatic, and he has handled it well. They have done right by that kid.

My brother had to talk in the basement since it was raining. I fear I was annoying him by asking him to repeat himself; see, I already do that often enough when I can hear clearly simply because I need to hear it again to process (it is truly labor to communicate with me). I had a bit of a hard time hearing him from the interference. It is what it is. He felt a bit manic he said (I know that feeling). He was talkin' fast, and he was jokin' a lot. God damn, I think he is in a lot of pain. I know it's easier that he knows this transition is coming up, so it's not sprung on him. But, no matter how you cut it, this is hard.

My brother continues to think about the values and preferences of different mediums with me. He changed the subject, lol. Fair enough!

He recommended a comic duo. I don't recall the names. I said I'd check it out, but I need the names. There was an interesting parallel he was drawing, and I'm not sure he was actually changing the subject either. Hmm. You know what, I don't trust my model. Something's off, but I don't know what I missed.

My brother has convinced me to try a book out: [[A Fire Upon the Deep]]. The ontology is odd. Also, my brother is always making good recommendations to me; I wish I knew how to make good recommendations to him (I think this is a sign that I'm not empathizing effectively enough with my brother if I can't gift him recommendations as effectively as he can for me). I'd like to be able to share this with him and understand his point of view with clarity. He's been telling me about this book for a while, and I think I missed the hint that I should read it. Or, maybe I've misunderstood.

I had to abruptly stop the conversation, and I'm worried I hurt my brother's feelings. On top of that, when I responded back, I woke him up (fuck!).
