title: 2020.03.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: AIR!

* Woke at 11
** Best night of sleep I can recall in a while. My neck is feeling much better too.
*** One more night like that, and I'll be set.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* [[JRE]] Called
** He talked with [[AIR]]. 
*** [[AIR]] is feeling bad that he's not been staying in contact. 
**** I think he believes I'm going to be angry, but I'm just relieved.
**** My goal is not to ask why and to just be with him. If he wants to think about it with me, he will.
*** Said he'd call me, but not sure his phone is working.
**** Going to reach out over le FB.
***** Throwaway coming in handy.
***** Choking over his FB feed over 12 years on a single page. There's a lot of pain in there. =(
****** Pandemonium, as he says. I wish I knew how to help.
***** Done. Trying to move to something at least saner.
** Invited him (the baby and Rebecca as well) up.
*** He knows he can come any time, but while he's off of work, it might be extra suitable. Still, probably not possible with a baby.
* Offspring and I played cards. Lol. 
* Dialectures
* Completely finished dining area head to toe. 
** Went through all our wiring and computer parts too.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Schools are shutting down or going online all over the place.
** We're figuring out what will be happening with my wife here.
* Offspring prepped, adults cooked.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** So weird to have a table again. It's wonderful.
** Brought out [[MTG]] for the occasion.
*** My son has dubbed the deck I made for my wife "Tittyburn" since I've 20 custom Lewd mountains.
** Pasta, salad
** Round-robin play.
*** My wife adores her pacifist turbofog deck.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
* We decided not to do [[vidyas]] again...fek.
* Talked with [[AIR]]!
** FUCK YEAH! He called me up after small FB exchange.
** Several hours of discussion.
** He's doing okay. Transition to the corporate job went poorly (understandably, not really much better than the country club on that front), but now he's at an Italian joint which treats him like a human. 
** He wanted to talk about and apologize for not staying in touch. We're good. I'm just happy that he's alive and well.
** We caught up. Laughed and cried a lot.
** Sent shows: Fleabag, The Boys, and dat Birbiglia special
** Still has Signal up on phone, but hasn't updated his machine in a long time.
*** Don't know password, so I can't SSH in. He doesn't know it either; he just types it off the top of his head. 
*** Sent instructions for Discord. We'll see.

* Sleep by 3
