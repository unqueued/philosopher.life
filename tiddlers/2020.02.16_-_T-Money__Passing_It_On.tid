This is also my grandmother's rifle. Her great grandma's it's a family airloom. Talked alot about survival and alot of gun safety of course. Her first time at the range he have done enough with bb rifle and archery. So it was time.

Had I waited to long she might lose interest.

Party went well. Sleep till noon yosayn though. Catchup from Friday night.
Feb 16 2:05pm
How are you guys and what are /have you been up to?
Feb 16 2:05pm
Will you be giving the rifle to her, eventually?
Feb 16 2:05pm
(huge fan of gun safety here; we practice the basics with our air rifles...in time, will take them out with some real guns to appreciate it)

I hope to pass down all of my things to my kiddo. However if she doesn't show an interest then I would probabaly liquidate and just give her the $. Or pass it to another family member on my dad's side. Not alot of boys yet. Maybe I get a Grandson.
Feb 16 2:07pm
Glad the party went well too. Hopefully, all the parents will start binding the kids together, making it happen.
Feb 16 2:07pm
You'd be a hilarious grandpa to have.
Feb 16 2:07pm
Agreed. We went ahead and let Samantha find another friend for tonight. So I should have another girl plus Samantha here tonight.
Feb 16 2:08pm
Lol. I'm glad you would say that. I hope I have a Grandson to pass down my guns and tools and old truck to.
Feb 16 2:09pm
I have so much stuff. It woukd be a true burden if I passed. I have voiced my wishes but I do not have a living will. I might work on that tonight.

Gun safety is so important. I have seen alot more slunsafe actions and people with guns than safe actions. Lol.
