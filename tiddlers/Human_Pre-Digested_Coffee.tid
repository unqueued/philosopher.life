title: Human Pre-Digested Coffee

//Sheeeeeiiiiiiiiiitt.//

Art project: can I make the rich literally consume my shit?

They do this with elephants and cats: kopi luwak has been the most expensive coffee in the world.

I could literally eat coffee (which I already do often enough anyways; I like eating coffee beans), shit it out, clean/process it, and sell it as super expensive coffee. I'll have to measure caffeine safety considerations and enable myself to step down off caffeine in a safe way (good thing I have kilo of caffeine anhydrous). I should talk to some experts about the issue.

Would you give me a $1,000 dollars for a cup of //my// coffee?

Unfortunately, I could easily a wealthy person buying this as a prank gift. I can't ultimately target me prankees.
