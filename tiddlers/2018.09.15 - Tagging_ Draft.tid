title: 2018.09.15 - Tagging: Draft

It's clear to me that the //Draft// tag is worth using. I need a way to demonstrate that I have not assented without going full fucking [[/b/]]. My letters, in particular, require time to form and solidify. I have to do it out in the open, and I have no problem being held account for the evolution of my thought (the snapshots do matter). I still need a way to signify that it's still largely in progress and may radically change. My edits after I send a letter meant to clean up grammar for the most part.
