!! About:

//I dedicate this page to those glorious German wordies and hermeneutic spiral-tarpits who inspired this tool: Kant, Hegel, and Heidegger.<<ref "sh">> For the finite, truth is precise but not always concise.//

I exuberantly write in my own hot-wired autistic language with little regard for the unjustified language conventions of those who aren't listening to (and weren't going to listen to) me in the first place.<<ref "1">> People with sufficient learning will realize I have profoundly listened to Humanity; I've empathized deeply with [[The Great Human Conversation]], and without a doubt, most (if not all) of my message is really an extension of yours. I'm not trying to punish the reader with a vague shibboleth or golemic Tower of Babel; this is as clear a bridge as I can make (remember: I'm trying to cross this bridge).<<ref "en">>

My work of art is: messy, dense, overdimensioned, poorly modeled, verbose, complex, organic, rhizomatic, telic, functionally overloaded, recursively self-referential, explosively enigmatic, neologized, portmanteauic, caveatic, computational, philosophical, superweird, absurd, constantly evolving, radically unconventional, and wildly unfun to interpret. Often, I am a very poor communicator; I wish it weren't so. I'm doing my autistic best to communicate and become the best person I can be. Here I hope to ease our hermeneutic burden while code-switching to my inner tongue.

This hlexical [[hlexicon]] is my specialized dictionary to decode some of my inscrutable language, a key to reading my reality map (as well as the patterns arising from it), and my ugly-hackish homemade stencil tool for painting with words. Here you find a particular methodological chunk of my deprivatized personal notation. This metamodern macro-metaprogramming modeling tool is designed to help us defuse our postmodern language game with as much sincerety in my foundation as I can muster.

I'd like to warn you: I am prone to employ and develop a jargony personal language on this wiki in order to be laconic, unambiguous, and maximize both the space and detail of my expressivity (even if only with and for myself). Sometimes I need to be as exacting with myself as I can be in order to pack just the right punch and lacunarity. Sometimes precision just makes the job easier, but othertimes it enables the creation of something which couldn't have been created otherwise for pragmatic logistical or theoretic reasons. There is a profound flexibility in the objects I can construct and demonstrate when I'm precise with my language, and ultimately, the point is to ungibberishify and justify myself (perhaps paradoxically with gibberish) in order to more effectively shape my identity.

While it may be hard to believe, I'm avoiding intentional obscurantism. I sometimes use my old religious language to compile a new one. I fear and sometimes celebrate that my writing can be poorly organized, irrelevantly vectored, variable naming convention anti-patterned, fragmentedly ignorant, lazy-arrogant, manically impulsive, circuitously redundant, [[infinigress]]ively disjointed, toxically postmodern, overminingly self-undermining, unnecessarily overcoined, unbearably solipsistic, insularly gnostic, cultically argotic, unacceptably loan-worded, annoyingly calqued, egregiously Nabokovian, sadistically Pynchonian, unironically redundant, drainingly listical, and way too fucking long.<<ref "ft">> I'm sorry if it fails to add up for you.<<ref "dj">> 

Don't get me wrong. I'm climbing the monkeybars of meaning like an especially retarded ape. I know it. Admittedly, I'd like to see you do better. Teach me, master. Let me learn your ways. I need it! I strongly hope once you understand what I'm saying you'd be able to say it better than I can.

Alas, I'm stuck in my context. Like a (hopefully) virtuous weak-Sapir-Whorfian autist, I'm overshooting the golden epistemic mean (in my context) by attempting to become more schizophrenic in how I consciously model my language, which gives profound shape to the possibility of what thoughts I can or will likely have. Crucially, I don't know what's really worth thinking, so therefore I often try to [[/b/]]ishly say everything that matters to me and sort it out later. Unfortunately, even then, I can't pick out the universal particulars with maximum salience, but I have to try. Sometimes, taking the time to austically develop my own language really is instrumentally useful to my intermediate schizophrenic goals (which themselves are instrumental to reaching for the final goals of epistemic and ontic self-justification).

I realize there is a madness, perhaps even a kind of memetic violence, to employing an overly particularized patois, especially as I change over time. Of course, I am worried that privatizing my language too far makes it useless or inaccessible to others (and perhaps even eventually myself). In a practical sense, I must break my own autistic code and untangle the web for myself before I could hope to more conventionally encode it for others.
