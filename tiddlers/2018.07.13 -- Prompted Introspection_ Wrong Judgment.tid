title: 2018.07.13 -- Prompted Introspection: Wrong Judgment

!! When have you realized you were really wrong in your judgment about someone?

My donors, [[MWF]] and [[SLT]], have been people I've been wrong about to varying [[dok]] over the years many times over. Becoming a parent, learning how much they have cultically gaslit and colored my perceptions, carefully reasoning about my past, watching the lives of my brothers, and living apart from my donors has helped me understand who we were and are. I see them far more clearly now.
