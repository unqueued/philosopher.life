title: 2019.05.04 - DeathOfRobinhood: Thlog of Isaac

I've stopped and rewritten this response a number of times. The more I read of your thought-log (thlog?), particularly the exchanges, the more I find questions and ideas that have already been answered and expressed. I also feel the imbalance of information; like, the rate at which we can discover each other is terribly uneven. I'm not saying this to denigrate the medium which you've chosen to express yourself (I find it/you fascinating), but to explain my awkwardness. I'll begin by answering some of your questions, both to avoid the pressure of feeling like I have to say something unique, and to even the distribution of knowledge a little bit.

My name means 'God is gracious'. It also rhymes with my last name (sorta). It isn't the sort of thing I'd have expected from my parents, but maybe they were different people before they had me. I like my name.

One theme I enjoyed seeing you treat is education. I was publicly educated myself, but my dad never assumed there was a ceiling to what a kid could learn and, while he was able to, sought to broaden the scope of my interests to the extent he was able. Are you familiar with John Gatto Taylor? Your desire to enrich your students, as well as the way you approach educating your own kids, seems to reflect his philosophy and is the sort of spirit I'd like to have should God ever grant me children.

My work right now is the development (story and animation lead) for a kid's cartoon to be broadcast locally. I'm in a rather unique position in that I've entered a non-traditional studio context in which we creatives are actually able to develop content and a pipeline with relatively little meddling from the suits. There are stills all sorts of regrettable concessions to be made to writers who hate cartoons, and producers who hate children, but there's a level of free action that brings with it the sense of responsibility to make something that's actually good for our viewers.

An example: One of my earliest TV memories. A cartoon, probably imported from Japan, featuring cute woodland creatures living in a Beatrix Potter-esque society. A little mole is playing basketball by himself outside of his little molehill home. All stubby limbs and glasses, he makes the shot, misses, and tries again. His aloneness and lack of athletic ability are enough to establish our sympathy when he's suddenly confronted by a mob of angry animals who've come to accuse him of stealing carrots from the garden co-op. He maintains his innocence, but they cast his name off as evil. We then follow the animals, certain of their just condemnation, away; the show is actually about them and not the mole, after all. We later see him, inside his molehill at night, with a single lantern lighting the room, sitting at his table, glasses off, as he cries into his arms. Through my own tears, this scene opened up a world to me; the idea of people (or moles) having continuous emotional lives whether or not I can see them. I haven't been able to identify this show all these years later. Today it functions for me as narrative bedrock testifying to the positive power creatives can have have when they care about content for kids.

My primary responsibility is not to the Isaacs, however, but to God.

An example: I was already a working freelancer when I became a Christian at 21. I quickly became aware that I was every bit morally accountable in my work as I was in every area of my life, and that suddenly there were lots and lots of jobs that became closed off to me. That is, I could no longer, in good conscience, take on animation work that I felt fed upon (and fed in return) human vice. This led to very real opportunity losses including missing out on the career-launching Skullgirls game and an offer by an interested investor to start my own studio. I carried on in a work desert for about six months until, with feeling! I got down on my face and told God that I'd quit the animation biz entirely if that's what He wanted, but that if there were a way I could stay in this trade working gigs that weren't compromising, I'd sure appreciate it if He could provide a lead. That very hour I received an email from someone who'd seen my reel asking if I was free to produce a series of animated shorts teaching kids English as a second language. Since then, I've earned a modest living in education (kids and adult) and non-predatory entertainment. I try to make a practice of regularly identifying areas in which compromise is a risk (the (many) areas in which I've committed to the compromise already are of course, largely invisible to me, and I'm dependent on the honesty of people (particularly people I've hurt) and the Holy Spirit (who I've also hurt) to help me).

I think this may suggest (forgive me if I'm wrong) one of the areas in which we differ. My conviction is, and I have many (no doubt selected via confirmation bias) stories to back this, that The Good is interactive in ways that a simple unidirectional 'belief/adoration' can't account for. This alone doesn't even get us to the idea of a 'Thing-y' Transcendent with a personality aspect, let alone the God as incarnated in Christ, but it's enough to get me to feel like I'm not primarily an examiner, but an engager; someone with Something with which I can engage.

On that note, I found Glenn Miller's Christian Think Tank because I needed to, I guess. At the time, I hadn't come across any other contemporary apologists I resonated with, and I liked how precise (and warm) he is. I'd assumed his format was partially a limitation of the forms that were available in site building in 1994, and can't really think of anything comparable today, particularly since the internet went 'professional'.

I do like to read some stuff in the Rationalist sphere (mostly SSC and its sattelites), but I'm not really at all Rational. I'm also not at all as well-read as I'd like to be though I always have a few books going simultaneously. At the moment I've got Taleb's Skin in the Game (commuting), Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares (side-bag+bedside), Bettelheim's The Uses of Enchantment (living room), Hymen's The Ultramind Solution (bathroom), Corbett & Fikkert's When Helping Hurts (weekends), and Walton's The Lost World of Genesis One (anti-social lunches). All of my books tend to go on hold when I find a good novel. Also been on sort of an Asterix comics kick recently.

I like showing off my library, and I like inspecting the libraries of others. I think another thing I like about your project is that is does many of the things a library inspection does, but without the intermediation of other authors.

Last thing for now, I pieced together what I said "You write about some reaching out to you with an aim to co-operate, or else, to seek help" from the invitation to cooperate on this project of dialectic discovery on your Contact page, and the playfully sincere introduction in Find the Others.

Wanting of the sort of integrity and courage I'd truly like to manifest,

Ivan
