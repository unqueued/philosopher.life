title: 2018.08.18 - Prompted Introspection: Best Teacher

!! Who was the best teacher you ever had, and why?

Define teacher. I suggest it's more useful to talk about teachers who develop theories of my mind. In a way, this is about asking about my best wrestling partners. I would like to [[hope]] it is [[me|h0p3]]. That sounds ridiculous, but at the end of the day, it really should be me. That doesn't make me a good teacher (although, I'm not half bad in some respects), but the "for me" of [[gfwiwcgws]] almost requires I answer the question this way. I've been teaching myself my entire life, and I usually want the best for myself.

Of course, I treasure my other teachers. They have been profound memetic fountains and offered their giant shoulders to me. Do they have to be living? If not, I think Aristotle is the answer. I'm truly indebted to that man (and so many others).
