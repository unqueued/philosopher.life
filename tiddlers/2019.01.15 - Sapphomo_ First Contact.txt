[6:46 PM] Sapphomo: love your introspectional amazing TW! i bet you are a real fun dad and your kids are going to turn out super cool :smiley:
[7:55 PM] h0p3: That is high praise. Thank you. I'm sitting here thinking about what you said.
[7:58 PM] h0p3: It's an emotional topic for me.
[7:59 PM] h0p3: I know you mean your compliment, and I am grateful for it. Obviously, you're very kind to reach out and say anything to a stranger like me (Hello!). I also strongly value honestly (maybe to a fault). Imho, I  am not a fun dad most of the time (you can speak with my children, and they'll testify I'm not nice [even if I aim to be kind]); at best, I try to be a good dad. I'm more of a tyrant who tries to find ways to reach into his children's minds and connect them to reality. They are super cool (even if they don't know it yet).
[8:00 PM] h0p3: I'd like to know more about you too! Tell me about yourself. I am grateful for the opportunity to meet nomads in the desert.
