title: The Shining

Jesus. The characters are dark, and outside of the supernatural elements, the realism is strong to the point of being painful. King does not shy away from showing the fundamental evil embedded in us all. It's graphic. I don't like horror. =(

I think part of what is painful about this book for me is that I empathize with Jack, and he reminds me of how much of a failure I am.

The book is agonizingly slow.

The Freudian analysis of Danny by the doctor is unrealistic and felt forced to me. I'm unhappy with it. It's not a good mechanic.

Red drum red rum. Always struck me as a kid. I didn't realize it was in the book. My wife pointed out the obvious to me: It's "Murder" backwards.

=) Redpilled as fuck.

Said multiple times: "You weren't hired to philosophize, Torrance." I take it, that is not an accident.

My wife asked me about whether or not I had seen the bathroom scene. I said I did, but I thought she was talking about the wasps. Then she talked about the mirror and red rum, looking at me like I was an idiot for not seeing that it talked about murder. Apparently, that scene happens later in the book. And, King flatly tells you it says Murder! I would have gotten it, but only because he slaps you in the face with it.

I can't tell how much King aims for symbolism. The boiler is no joke, but does it mean something more?

King is clearly an alcoholic. He writes about it so strongly.

The telepathy hack to understand a character's stream of consciousness is not abused to the point of me hating it.

One striking thing about the way in which the will of the persons of these stories are supernaturally controlled is that, well...you can kind of see how this would happen (at least some of the ugly parts) without having had a supernatural cause in the first place.

Daaaaaaaaannnnnny...Lol. This is the first creepy thing to me so far.

I am struck by how the "revealer" of reality (or alternate reality/hyperreality/simulracum) is this supernatural god who could be benevolent but instead is not in this case. It downright Cartesian->Heideggarian->Baudrillardian (Malebranche, whatever, a thousand philosophers have seen this demonlight). But, when I think about the intentions and consequential aspects of the revealer, I see that the truth can be horrifying, it burns us alive. I have changed my mind about the nature of the supernatural in King's work. It does play a role that cannot be removed without detracting from the meaning of the story.

King makes it clear how evil is schizophrenic, but I wish he made it clearer how schizophrenic experiences are not fundamentally the error of the experiencer. That conceptual point should be driven home harder than he has.

I admire what King does. He makes me sick to my stomach. I don't think I can read more of this, at least not for a while.
