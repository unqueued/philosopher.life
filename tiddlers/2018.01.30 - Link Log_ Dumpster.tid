*** Stoicism applied poorly. The inability to recognize external forces and be objective about causality is a perception distortion that we should not accept. Effective (and defensible) stoic honesty is about recognizing where the limits of your power are as an individual, but his argument extends to the point of making citizenship meaningless and appears to be victim-blaming (he leaves himself a caveat in the video, but it does not save him). Remember: it's completely your fault that you are unhappy! Lol. Godwin's Law time: we really shouldn't blame the Jews for being massacred in the holocaust. This video could have been really amazing if it cleaned up its very poor notion of moral responsibility, collective action, and refrained from entering the political foray. Unfortunately, it's a piece of political propaganda.
