title: 2017.03.28 -- Pipefitting Log

We were given our new study guide questions. I'm trying another study method (since mine is obviously not good enough). Hopefully I get the kind of coverage I'm looking for. We were told to move onto the simulator (probably because the other guys weren't even trying to study). 

We measured again because I just wanted to make sure we didn't miss anything. We did the math twice. I'm glad we thought carefully about the valve, since we put true lengths on the graph (my preference, strongly), and thus we had to do what I will call "add-ons" instead of takeouts. This was a smart way to do it. After 15 minutes, I was satisfied by our measurements, drawing, and math. So, we moved onto construction. 

They went straight for threading, while I setup the work area, gathered the materials (we are consuming all the nuts/bolts and flanges the shop has available to us to build this simulator). I cut and threaded the tiny nipples because I wanted to guarantee they were correct. They did check the threads this time (thank god). 

After we had finished the fabrication, and right before we were about to mount it, I crossed the teacher in the storage area. He had a shit-eating grin on his face. He had a valve in each hand (I wondered if and when he would introduce these, since he had hinted he would). He claimed "the engineer changed his plans, and we needed to insert them into our previous projects." I laughed.

I found a clean way to make the insertion without having to remove everything. Ultimately, I didn't even need to loosen any secondary flanges. I screwed the leg off the spiders, made the cuts, inserted and leveled, and put it back on (I thought I made a mistake towards the end of the day, but realized I was on track: I was just tired). But, we didn't complete these steps until the end because I wanted to mount our current project before backtracking to add valves to the older ones. Since I knew we could do it, we did.

We mounted this third simulator project without a hitch. It went on very cleanly. Our teacher gave us a very unique hand-made tool that he says could not be bought anywhere. He earned it at Eastman. Says it is amazing. It was quite useful for aligning the flanges. He called it a bull's penis; it looked a bit like a shepherd's staff with the end of the crook straightened out and conical. It's like a cheater-bar for alignment and holding shit in place. The 90 degree angle on it is very interesting. I'm going to make one of these, I believe.

Anyways, we then did the work for the rest. I did the math. They checked it (well, Chris did), and we did it. At the end of the day, we were told that it would have been better for the bottom valve to have been facing up (wish he said that before we built around it). Luckily, I had thought he might have said something about how one of them was off. We cheated by taking two wrenches, one on each adjacent pipe and turned together to get it placed where we wanted it. I'll try to do the same tomorrow with the bottom valve; it only needs to turn 90 degrees.

The teacher called up the company that donated the materials for our simulator. He wants to build and install a second one next to the one we have. This would allow us to make far more complex objects. I think it's a good idea. We talked about where to place it. They e-mailed him back immediately to ask for a materials list. I'll compile it tomorrow. We may be building it soon. That's be cool.

My teacher told us that we'll be doing rolling-offset screwpipe for at least this week instead of moving onto socket welds because Chris hasn't done rolling-offsets in practice (although, he has done the math). I need to make sure that Chris aces this if we are going to move on. Nash is going to be as useless as ever, I'm sure, lol. 

Nash was saying at the end of the day that he was pissed we weren't getting out early. He feels entitled to maximum breaktime. Now, I totally understand that approach in a work environment in which people are legitimately trying to exploit you. You absolutely have to fight for every inch. Our class, however, isn't exploitation (or at least not in this respect). We're here for ourselves, and we move at our own pace. I take limited breaks because I want to keep working on myself. That's what I'm there to do. I'm sure I would have made the same mistakes (or worse) at his age though. I can't say much. I try to encourage him. That said, I'm sure he will turn into another conservative capitalist monster. =/ I can't help that he's evil though. 

Also, I need to finish the gifts I'm making for my parents'-in-law to thank them.
