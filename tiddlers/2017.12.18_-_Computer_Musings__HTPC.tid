title: 2017.12.18 - Computer Musings: HTPC

m10 is set, by and large. Sync ended up being slower than just sftp, sadly. I grabbed my stuff, setup the syncs, and that's that.

Fixed daily snapshots. I guess I missed a couple days. I thought my daughter implemented it in the git script, but I see it didn't. It is fixed. I still need to mass rename the old to match the new format.

HTPC is giving off static. I think we might have a grounding problem. It is reporting electrical errors for the USB drives. Temps were fucking 100c. Reseated and put a large heatsink on it meant for OCing. Not booting up, although there is power going to it. I hope it's not bricked, and more importantly, I hope that our electrical system is safe. I tried contacting my brother, but I didn't get ahold of him. I will later. I need to know. 

Helped my wife with some CLI work for searching her wiki. She couldn't get the save to work.

Trying to get it working on her's. Problems. Don't know CMOS password, but don't feel like hard resetting it. 

ksuperkey is equivalent to ALT+F1. Just had to make my menu work against with super. noice.

D2 is up and running.
