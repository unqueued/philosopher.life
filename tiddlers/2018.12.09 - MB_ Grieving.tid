Hey! Today is a better day. I've been wallowing. But not just passively. I carved out time to rest and actively grieve. I actually just got back from hanging out with a friend and I wasn't jovial all the time but it was good practice being a human again. 

How have you been?

We've been good. Working on the wiki, homeschooling. Kids are healthy; had their doctor's visit. I'm teaching in an afterschool program (I'm a good babysitter). [[k0sh3k]] applied for a job in Costa Rica (would be cool if she got it).

What's the afternoon program like? And Costa Rica sounds exciting!

It's been surreal. Reminds me of what I had as a child in some respects. I think I will be useful to them (or I'm gonna try :P).
