!! Audit:

* We never did play any magic. I don't know why.
* I have been sleeping quite a bit in general this month, and it started from the beginning.
* It has been a good FF month, although I'm still running into instabilities.
* You know what, I actually did serious philosophical work this month. I thought I didn't, but now that I look back, I am proud of what I did.
** Fundamental Philosophy too!
* It's taken a while to get to the extraction. I'm glad I've been thoughtful about it.
* I should finish Curtis' work off.
* I desperately need to finish [[Meaningness]] off. I'm behind, officially, in reading my own books.
* I had some brief days on this wiki, sadly. There were some roughpoints in the month.
* I had a day interesting enough that I did the review over [[Recent]]. I wish I did that more often. 
* I love shoving costly noise-fists up their asses.
