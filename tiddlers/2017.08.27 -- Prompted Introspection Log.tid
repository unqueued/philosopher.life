!! Why do you get hives, rashes, and systemic fungal infections while stressed?

Because that's what happens to some people when they are experiencing significant stress.

Looking through the symptoms and biology of it, is is clearer than ever to me that my wife is incredibly stressed. I feel like I've failed here. I hope I can make it up to her. The pieces are going to fit together. We'll get there.

I scratch a lot while nervous and anxious. I fidget a lot while nervous.

Ultimately, it can be evolutionarily useful to you to feel anxious, nervous, and stressed. I need to act upon it. I can fix it. I can be stoic, work hard, have hope, and more than likely it will heal.
