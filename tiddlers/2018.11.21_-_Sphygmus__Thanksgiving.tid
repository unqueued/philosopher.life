title: 2018.11.21 - Sphygmus: Thanksgiving

Dear Madame Sphygmus,<<ref "tl">>

`/hug`; It is good to see you again! 

I hope the desert has been treating you well. I have seen you here and there from across the dunes, and I'm grateful to have the chance to sit down to have a conversation with you. I am convinced part of ancient leisure is the work of putting down my tentpegs //with// [[others]], building civilization, crafting [[The Republic]], and constructively finding our [[Humanity]] in the desert. I will say it again: you are community to me.

This letter has taken me longer to write than usual, and I'm not sure why. Sometimes my thoughts pour out with little friction or effort,<<ref "fr">> but not this time. I don't know what that means or why, but thank you. I appreciate how you've sent me wandering into a deepthink in the desert, and as usual:<<ref "us">> I am grateful to your patience with me. You remind me yet again that conversation is an art (the form and practice of which I am still learning as an autist<<ref "bs">>). It is true: you bring out and help me develop the best in me.

<<<
Dear h0p3,

On the subject of watching my words unfold - I am definitely still playing with that! One of the letters has started as a draft on paper, with all its misspellings and scratch marks and so on. I'm drawn to that physical side of writing - I've always liked that the word "inking" is a part of "thinking."
<<<

That is cool. Are you interested in calligraphy and the arts of physical letters as well? My children do not spend enough time in ink (a disservice to them), but I've been trying to change that. Unfortunately, my handwriting has devolved over the years (but my stick figure drawings look good); I can barely read it unless I'm purposely writing it for [[others]]. I hope writing my wiki will not similarly devolve.

In many cases, it's hard to beat paper (for the drawing, prototyping, and mutability especially); sometimes I feel less willing to make mistakes when I'm typing (and that is itself a mistake in many cases). I also like my notebooks, especially for work. Chalkboards and whiteboards go a long way for me too. I even got some fancy chalk for the chalkboard that covers the space above our fireplace (itself covered by HTPC's TV below); we like to decorate the house with chalk wallpaper or paint. Our glass backdoor usually has the larger cave drawings and neandrathalic algorithmic-visions painted in dry erase on it. Not everything is neatly digitized or forced onto a screen.<<ref "c">> I wonder if that will change. I hope one day to feel so fluent with my [[Monster-Φ]] that digital "inking" will be the same as digital thinking for me. I do not know if that day will come. I enjoy entertaining the transhumanists' claim we will think straight into our machines; sometimes I believe it too.

As always, I would like to know more about you in this respect. I want to practice thinking your thinking process.

<<<
I'm going to digress for a moment here and respond to the last three paragraphs in [[Arr]], which I haven't yet touched on in any of my replies. Well - try to respond.
<<<

Those have been a powerful three paragraphs for me to re-read. You are living proof that I should have hope in the desert. Also, as always, please take as long as you'd wish; it may even rightfully be years before you address it.

<<<
It is hard for me to //hear// your words about me because I am often immersed in my own negativity about myself. As a knot wrapped up inside me, that negativity is a thing only I can (in a slow-motion process) untangle. Your words feel good to read and are another lens to see myself through.
<<<

Perfectionists Unite! With our powers combined, we shall finally align our noble intentions and outcomes. I'm, uh, still working on this one myself, lol! I am indebted to your willingness to empathize with me. You make me feel less alone, and I'm glad I can be of use to you.

I am re-struck by some of [[your first words to me|2018.08.29 - Sphygmus: Find The Others]]: 

<<<
I worry that they would not stand up to your scrutiny.
<<<

It sounds like you scrutinize yourself quite a bit too. I have such mixed emotions on the topic. I look at the world around me and wish they would scrutinize themselves far more than they do, but at the same time, it is clear to me that some individuals are way too hard on themselves. =) Yeah, you got the bug. Without irony, I do not feel qualified to say much more here; I fear I will not escape that thought loop.

I appreciate that you take the time to write to me. Even my own extended family does not read what I have to say; to some non-trivial [[dok]], they really don't care what I think. They don't take the time to engage me in writing either (I realize it is draining). I think you have balls/ovaries/fortitude necessary to be curious and actually try to connect at this level. You and [[kicks]] make me see everyone else in my life differently. I hate to say it, but it barely feels like I get to be a human around most humans (though that itself may be part of the human condition).

I am glad that my words feel good to read! Though sometimes it can be hard to hear, I do not wish for my writing to be hard to hear [[irwrongfrr]] (and I am still thinking about what you have said); I hope to continually be a useful lens for you.<<ref "jr">> It is here in the desert that Reason is about respecting the dignity of [[The Other]] in how we use each other as means (though not //mere// means) to each other as ends (or perhaps the final-means to [[The End]]). I think this is an exercise of emergent and collaborative autonomy. I am grateful that you offer me the opportunity to understand both of us better than I could by myself. Again, you follow [[The Golden Rule]]; I wish the world was populated by people like you, [[Sphygmus]]. You actually give a shit even when it can sometimes overbearingly mean caring so much that it hurts.

Mutually empathizing with each [[other]] also gives us windows into ourselves through the [[other]]'s lens.

<<<
I'm touched and honored by your desire to extend your personal information to me; I agree that it is a non-trivial gesture.<<ref "dig">>
<<<

Awesome! It took us a while to send it, but it was Thanksgiving. This time of year usually feels like a whirlwind.

It feels awesome to be able to extend it. I am overjoyed to trust you. It feels impossible to me, and I am still stunned by it. Despite trying to fix it, I only have two neighbors that know my name. My wife and I are among the few dozen people (dog owners) who even walk outside on the reg out of hundreds on top of our mountain (don't get me wrong; I'm a hermit that loves to stay in doors). Nobody seems to want to really know anyone else.

To the footnote: ROFL. You caught me with my pants down.<<ref "det">> If you're talking about what I think you're talking about, that was a gorgeous drunken mistake.

`/facepalm` 

I have made a couple very large errors like that before. In fact, I found a ridiculously huge mistake very recently.<<ref "m">> Lol. Adding to it, my daughter teases me quite a bit about that one time where I posted the private signature key (I clearly have no idea what I'm doing). I'm trying to take more precautions still, but I am forever doomed to make these mistakes.<<ref "bob">> It is hard to combat bots and trolls while remaining crucially vulnerable.

Snoop away on ol' voldy, lol. If that doesn't scare you away, I assume nothing will. Indeed, it is cringeworthy.<<ref "a">> I still have misgivings about it (not with you, obviously). There's a lot of ammo on that page. Keepin' it real with integrity is //so much fun// as the world burns down around me.<<ref "n">>

<<<
I'm also perfectly content to keep unfolding hyperconversations with each other. I would love for you to mail me your card! I am a sucker for the physical, especially when it comes to design. It would be meaningful to have.
<<<

Done!<<ref "time">> Everyone in the family made something for you. I can't say anything will be directly useful or your cup of tea. But, I thought a little bit of everyone's art would be cool.

I am glad to have our [[hyperconversation]]s keep unfolding. This is awesome.

<<<
I am okay with the breadcrumbs that remain. As you say, if people dig deep, we are already owned on that front. I may change from /''''/sphygm.us after the domain expires, or I might not - I haven't decided yet. I am hosting it separate from my wiki and have `norobots` in the header, which are about the best measures I know to take for myself at the moment.
<<<

It would suck to lose your domain.<<ref "as">> It fits your moniker so nicely! It may be a worthy thing to give up eventually, but I would want to hold onto it if I were you.

I've changed domains myself (you may already know that). It was originally: http://h0p3.xyz/. I've thought about https://h0p3.wiki/. Getting people to write numerals in the URL bar doesn't seem to work out (getting them to spell "philosopher" is already a leap). I also have no intention of tying myself down to any particular URL. I can never own a URL, but I can own a private key. I hope to at least have a reasonable plan for working around censorship (if ever such a thing were to happen to me).

I leave a small hole for https://archive.org/ in my robots.txt. I'm not sure what else to do either.

I think anonymous hosting and writing are fascinating problems. That is a rabbithole I enjoy going down in my paranoia, but I think it requires becoming a different person to exercise. I do not care for dissociating to any [[dok]] more than is morally required of me. 

Alright, I have a question that I don't feel I can aptly answer on your behalf: ''Who do you want to read your site, and why?'' Perhaps that should already be clear to me, but I remain open to the possibility your answer is in development (mine is!).

<<<
Oh! I am also extremely touched and honored by the revamped [[Sphygmus]] page. Those are some incredible quotes you've included.
<<<

I thought you would like them. It's rare for me to represent someone with quotes, but they struck me in this case. Admittedly, there's significant work to be done in there, but that goes for everywhere on the wiki. 

<<<
 Clearly I need to dive into Dune as well.
<<<

It is [[my favorite fiction book|2018.11.22 - Prompted Introspection: Dune is Winrar]]. Perhaps that will change though. My last reading of [[Dune]] did not dazzle me as much as it used to. I think I will wait a long time to read it again.

Do you have any books you think I should put on my reading list? Are there sites I need to hyperread to understand you (even indirectly)? I'm bad about this thing, but I hope to improve my process. It is important to me that I also come to understand you through the references that are vital to you (however you wish to reveal yourself). You already speak my language so absurdly well, and I feel like I am blindly trying to learn how to speak yours (I owe you that).

<<<
In another connection to names, one of my pseudonyms online has been/is "elanor." I first chose it from a book series I was all about in middle school, and then later realized:

> "Frodo thought for a moment. 'Well, Sam, what about elanor, the sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of Lothlórien?'"

Names are funny things - they signify the being of ourself to others, yet in and of themselves there's nothing inherently //ours// other than some amount of legal force and habituation.<<footnote "bit" "Regardless of the arbitrariness of my name, I'm fond of it, in large part because of the etymology.">> In America we are given names at birth and generally hold onto them our whole lives; we have no secular rituals for shedding a childhood name and taking up the name of an adult. I would be fascinated to read a study of if and how screen names open up the way we form ourselves in relation to names. What are the many ways in which people relate to the idea of a "username"? (Especially now, with the rise of "Log in with Facebook" sites, rather than username driven sites.)
<<<

Oh. `/peers-into-the-sign`; you have said magic words to me, //Madame// [[Sphygmus]].<<ref "may">>

You point to [[The Nameless]] (possibly in [[The Other]])! You are the first nomad to name naming so clearly with me (though I have tried before); I am indebted to you.

I can only point and tremble before that blinding Gödelian vortex. [[Names|Alias]] are funny, absurd, pointing to the impossible necessity of meaning, to that which we can only ever take up in uncertain faith. I adore your distinction between social convention and morality. I suggest you name The Desert of The Real; the Platonic Sun shines down on the reflective world around us to make its representation intelligible to we [[fff]]. The ancients attributed many powers to names, usually mere sorcery.<<ref "sy">> While I don't believe in sorcery, I cannot deny the fact that words are magical. To some [[dok]], we are a result of our names/words.

My names have evolved with me; I fear my [[4DID]] is littered with them. Before I was born as [[h0p3]], my previous primary names were [[4eak]] and [[gdoghomes]] (about one a decade since I was 12). Their shells still exist, but they are sublated now; they feel somehow partially hollow to me. This wiki is engaged in a different experiment: I [[hope]] to maintain my sublationary name, [[h0p3]], and instead engage in internal [[Self-Dialectic]] through ~~[[KIN]]~~ [[ehyeh]] and [[RPIN]]. Yes, I know how crazy it sounds to emulate such a thing. Even worse, I'm not terribly good at fleshing out these characters, but I cannot say I understand myself all that well either. I'm still piecing together that dialogue (poorly); it is one of the fundamental narratives in this wiki. That wrestling has given rise to {[[About]]}. As crazy as that might sound, it's the only methodology I've got so far.

I would also be interested in that study. "Logging in" points to dualism and the ghost in the shell to me. At least part of my systematic perspective on freewill is quite unpopular in contemporary academic philosophy.

<<<
I have at least one friend I met online who, despite knowing his legal name, I still think of as his screenname. To me, that screenname signifies our connection, discussion, his personality, and who he is – it feels incongruous to call him anything different. I expect I will keep thinking of you as h0p3 for the same reasons!
<<<

Ha! That's what we do too. We refer to you as [[Sphygmus]], a member of our extended family that we choose. As an added bonus, I think your name is super fun to say; it rolls off the tongue for me. This is //mere// phonetic association, but it conjures "''Sph''inx" and "En''igma''." Obviously, that is not how I assign the meaning, but I cannot deny there is a feeling I associate even just with the musical sound of words.

I enjoy having the chance to name myself. I feel more like myself as [[h0p3]] than as my birthname.

How about you? You are far more a digital native than I am, I believe. I ask you to continue fleshing out your insight here. Perhaps we will need to hyperread. I will be thinking more about this.

<<<
Lately I've been thinking about names in another way. I'm noticing more and more times when other people will use my name, whether it's after I pick up a phone call and say my name, or if it's a more casual use by classmates or friends. And I notice that I don't use theirs to the same extent, if at all. It feels like a social deficiency on my part. I wonder what reproduces it, what socialization process I missed to not have this habitual name usage as an unconscious part of me.
<<<

That is interesting; I feel the same way sometimes. I have no idea what it means. I assume some people have need of using names more than others and that it comes and goes. Do you feel like you have a hard time remembering names? 

I'm terrible at it. Faces are no problem, but I literally have to write names down (though names help with faces). In fact, even for TV shows I've seen literally a dozen times all the way through, I often can't name the characters names (but, if you say the name, I can recount who they are with significant detail).

I //dread// social encounters with people who know my name when I don't know theirs. I think it falsely signals to them that I have not put in the [[T42T]] effort to understand who they are when I can't remember their name; I suggest, however, I have usually put more thought into who they are than they have into thinking about me. Still, its a lowcost signal for most people. I believe the same problem that plagues my ability to hear the lyrics of songs is a factor in my inability to remember peoples' and characters' names (my memory as a capacity is something I think about a lot).

To some non-trivial extent, the labels, attributes, characteristics, properties, and models I generate about a person help form a kind of name.

<<<
I want to talk about the vocabulary of "modeling" another person as well. I think I have observed that people don't understand what you mean when you say you //clearnet doxx// them in order to better model them. For me, though, that was one of the most intuitive things you say. When I was in college the first time, I worked as an ILL student worker and loved it,<<footnote "oops" "though I was a horrible employee when it came to scheduling and not showing up (it was a time of bad spiraling) and I apologize to k0sh3k on behalf of every student like me...">> largely because it sent me wandering through the stacks to pull out such a varied selection of books. One of the books I pulled that really stuck with me discussed how we form mental models of people in our heads and rehearse conversations with those people at various times, and the ways in which those rehearsals could be helpful or not. If I remember correctly, there were even worksheet-like questions for shaping mentally rehearsed conversations in a more helpful way. Sadly, I can remember exactly where I pulled the book from in the library but I've been unable to figure out the title – I wish I could go back and read it again!

Of course it also has to do with the problem of other minds and the unbridgeable gap between //me// and //the outside world//. Inevitably we only know others through our construction of them within our own minds.
<<<

{{Text Art: Preach, yo!||ASCII: 100%}}

//Okay, okay. I'll exit full-praise-mode; it's unbecoming or something. I'll calm down and sit back in my pew. `/sit`. I promise not to speak in tongues without an interpreter too. Good, good.//<<ref "kc">>

You nailed it, Madame [[Sphygmus]].<<ref "md">> `/resists-urge-to-stand-back-up-to-slow-clap-or-do-the-We-Will-Rock-You-stomp`

Do you think I should speak about it differently? You clearly know what I'm saying, but others do not (this could easily be my fault). I should add: I think there are moral accountability considerations in my transparent process which have non-trivial value as well; I am applying [[T42T]] with every ounce of integrity I can muster.<<ref "tf">> I aim to model the pragmatic application of [[The Original Position]] since it is a very difficult concept in moral philosophy (imho, even many moral philosophers I respect do not understand it thoroughly).

As you know, there is an absolute ton packed into your last two sentences. There are different ways to interpret what you so clearly stated.<<ref "wh">> It is possible that you point to an incredibly skeptical path unless you are pointing to faith. I cannot answer the question effectively enough, but it is likely the equivalent of the fundamental question in philosophy. You obviously understand one of the core problematics I face in this wiki as a whole. Most people think I'm literally babbling, and I'm grateful that you don't. I appreciate your intuition and articulacy!

Lastly, [[k0sh3k]] says: "Tell her she's forgiven for being a bad student worker. :) College is stressful!" Lol! I know [[k0sh3k]] would be especially interested to hear more about your experiences there (professionally and personally). Personally, I think the fact you took the time to think about the content around you while working in the library shows a curiosity and humble integrity which has profound merit (it may even be part of what it means to really work there, imho).

<<<
I understand your thoughts on the MBTI. In my middle school and high school years I was extremely taken with personality tests and labeling. I am not sure they are useful to me, now. I started with MBTI,<<footnote "guess!" "As I think is your hunch, I am generally an IN(T/F)J in the tests I've taken.">>  and then found [[the enneagram|https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5]]. I was, of course, a type 5. Reading back on it, perhaps it says something true about me still.
<<<

I have no idea if they are useful, but sometimes they are striking. Psychology's replication crisis calls much into question. Of course, science as an institution is not identical with philosophically justified empiricism. Thus, I will think about these commonly dismissed things without feeling too bad about it.

I love that you know my hunch. =) I would be curious to know if such a thing is related to speaking people's names.

I've only recently heard of the Enneagram (I'm not "with it" ;P). Yeah, it has the same MBTI feel to it. I took it out of curiosity, and the [[test|https://www.eclecticenergies.com]] says the results are not clear for me. Our results may differ in this case. So, 1 if I have a single label, and 6w5 seems the strongest winged label (assuming the average is what matters). I'm not sure why the wings must ultimately be adjacent since 1w6 seems by far the most accurate to me.

* Type 1 - 11.7
* Type 6 - 10.7
* Type 8 - 8.7
* Type 5 - 8.4
* Type 4 - 7.7
* Type 2 - 6.4
* Type 3 - 5.7
* Type 9 - 1.3

Interestingly, [[k0sh3k]] is a 4w5, and 4 is apparently my disintegrator. I would argue that repeated construction and deconstruction is what makes the relationship so wonderful. This reminds me of [[Positive Disintegration]], a theory I am sold on.

I am further curious to know your Big5 traits (which appear to have more accepted empirical validity). You strike me as having an uncommon configuration.

<<<
The question of what psychometrics are worth considering and in what contexts is a large one. My worry is that categorization and labels tend to reify a person rather than opening up space for growth. Describing myself as an introvert conveys my tendency to get worn out after large amounts of social contact, but it hides the enjoyment I get from connecting with, listening to, and helping people. Perhaps this is something the Enneagram does better than most – aiming to bring awareness to our unconscious personality patterns in order to enable us to make more conscious choices.<<footnote "temp" "The idea of some inborn temperament seems to be supported by psychological research of infants, though it's broken into three classes: easy, slow to warm up, and difficult.">>
<<<

I think we agree. I am inevitably forced to use labels, adjectives, etc. to model (boxing things in is what makes it computable information at all for us). I not only appreciate that people can change, but I take it that capacity is the source of the dignity of personhood. While I rarely predict they will change (I am often relieved to be proven wrong), I must defend their autonomy as though it were my own. I do not deny it: pigeon-holing can be wielded to great evil,<<ref "rp">> but I also cannot deny that it is our epistemic plight (thus, [[IA2DYJ]]). Without the hardcoding, there is no software autonomy which can emerge. Despite a large class of concerns I have, I cannot deny that being the machine that modifies itself [[irwartfrr]] is what this is all about.

<<<
> Oh man, even with your guidance, I still couldn't get flexbox to work right for me. `/derp`

I didn't want to step on your toes, otherwise I might have tackled the problem earlier! I was worried about offending or implying that you weren't capable of solving your own problems when flex seemed like something you were interesting in pursuing. So, once you'd directly put it aside, I felt much better about doing the thing. Along the same lines, I have some thoughts on adding a style specifically for the ASCII art that I might explore and send to you once I get something working/polished to my satisfaction.<<footnote "bug" "The borders jumping on mouse-over bugged me too...hopefully I'll find a nicer solution with  an ASCII specific style.">>
<<<

I appreciate your desire not to offend me. Indeed, my ego is a trainwreck. I never learned well enough, and I wish I did. Long ago I lost the ability to just breathe new things in (and my excellent memory degraded), and it would be a significant opportunity cost for me to become adept. Thank you for helping me! I love computers, but I'm never going to be a wizard.<<ref "d">> Perhaps I will eventually acquire your skill. We will see.

It's a weird problem. I have lots of extended family who are programmers, and they all end up disliking using their computers in their free time. That's insanity to me. I could not give up my precious! I don't want to lose my love for something because work drained the passion out of it for me. I do not wish to lose my few sources of curiosity and creativity (though I suggest what little creativity I have must occur within a constraining box); I aim to protect it inside me.

<<<
Classes and life have been going well, though I've been very much in and out of overwhelm the whole time. Combining three classes, homework, work work, and my other obligations is probably the busiest I've ever successfully been. This isn't me complaining, because I know other people do much more successfully, but at the same time I can feel the toll it takes on me. I will be thankful when classes are over in a month and I'm //done// and graduated.
<<<

My letter is clearly so late, lol! It is likely you are finished or nearly finished as I type these words. I will celebrate with you from afar. In remembrance of your toil and perseverance: pick my poison, please. =)

Also, I know you aren't complaining, but you should free to complain to me! The amount of complaining I do in this wiki is literally epic. 

<<<
It has been really interesting to take college classes again after being out of academics for two years. It has been especially interesting to go from the private elite liberal arts college that is uChicago<<footnote "admin" "the admissions rate was 16% when I got in and according to google it's 8% now. what the hell.">> to a public university with slightly more than double the undergrad population. 
<<<

Taking a break from academia is valuable. It's easy to drown in what has become yet another limb of Capitalism, and I don't think it is the student's fault. 

<<<
There is a great evil in the desert, Madame [[Sphygmus]]. We must gather those we can to defeat it before it devours us all.

`/points-into-the-heart-of-the-desert`

''I'm coming for you, גולם.''
<<<

I have been watching admissions rates because they are important signals (and for my children too). It's easier to apply en masse,<<ref "em">> and that will influence acceptance rates. It appears top school grants have increasingly become the hail mary applications for more and more lowerclass individuals from around the globe who literally can't afford to go to school any other way. Waitlisting is more common too. The commodification of information and mobility is a disease.

The jump from what is considered one of the best schools in the world to a public university must have been fascinating. It will probably be something you wrestle with for a long time. I climbed up a similar ladder (and fell off it); it's shaped me quite a bit. I ask you to one day (perhaps far into the future) give me a significant account of it (I'm still in the process of doing so).

Even though I have problems with the University of Chicago (including its surrounding powers structures, and almost all the institutions like it [including my own]), you clearly learned a ton there. I'm straight up envious, lol! I wish I went to uChicago out of the gates, even though I think it's invaluable to have learned in many schools. While I know it's true, I have a hard time believing you are an undergrad. Some of the dialectical moves you make in the language game are unexpected (you are so often full of enchanting surprises for me). 

This may sound like a pressured question, and I don't mean it to be. Feel free to ignore it.<<ref "fh">> What are you doing after you graduate? Are you going to grad school? I don't actually know what you do for work or where you are going at all. Lol. I want to know your {[[dreams]]} and {[[focus]]}. I'm sure you will tell me  if and when (and to whatever [[dok]]) you feel comfortable. 

<<<
My intro psychology class is most like what I expected a public university to be like<<footnote "gr" "guilty of gross stereotyping here, I know">> with a large class, massive lecture hall, and readings from a textbook. Not that uChicago doesn't have classes like that, especially in STEM - the majority of my math and physics classes were in similarly large lecture halls  - but based on my experience I'd be surprised if their intro psych class didn't draw from primary and secondary sources, rather than a textbook.
<<<

Don't worry about me accusing you of undue stereotyping (you are so cautious, I have a hard time believing you would step over a line without strong justification); induction is at the heart of empiricism (I'm probably saying things you already know; I'm bad about that).

I agree that the quality of literature, tooling, teachers, and classmates who engage in the dialectic make or break the experience. It is a collective practice, and not everyone has the right intentions, resources, or incentives. I cannot say I am good at being a teacher or a student, but I aim to be.

<<<
There would also be little to no focus on working a //job// after graduation at uChicago, to the extent it wouldn't be mentioned in class at all. uChicago was all about the academic learning (again, I can only speak to the humanities since those were the classes I took - the economics major or the bio major might have been more career oriented, but even the comp sci major leaned heavily theoretical rather than "practical").
<<<

I likely say nothing new at all to you. I'm acking here.

I have mixed feelings about the issue. Of course, I despise the multi-faceted lies I grew up with that boiled down to "if you go to college, you'll have a good job." It gets much worse. I see the commodification of education everywhere. Advertisements are embedded in public schooling where I live (and the post-secondary). Schools have collapsed into finding your role in Capitalism. Even Milligan College (which has a good reputation in my region) has become a business which slots people into professional degrees without any serious well-rounded humanities education (they actively aim to dismantle the humanities, which is happening everywhere). I'm going to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I think those in power gleefully wish for students to be blind to what is [[salient]] in reality. I see education as the chance to be transformed, but in the material dialectic, far more is required to find equity in opportunity.

Schools ought to be useful for economic upward mobility, but they first and foremost ought to be concerned with maximizing human flourishing. These are conflated poorly and unjustifiably in many cases.

<<<
I'm also taking "Geographic Information Software for Urban Planning Majors" for shits and giggles.<<footnote "el" "It didn't have any prereqs, I figured it would be easy since I'm good at tech stuff, and I have a passing interest in maps too.">> That class is dramatically different than any I took at uChicago - the teacher emphasizes that this is meant to prepare them for their career path and requires rote definition answers because "that is what interviewers will want to hear".
<<<

Oh, god. That sounds terrible. Lol. I mean, the title of the class doesn't, but regurgitation alone drives me crazy (though I still test for it myself to some [[dok]]). I am really bad with maps, but I think they are interesting. I played a couple MMORPG's as a lad, and cartography in virtual worlds is a unique practice. That's not the same as urban planning, I realize. Mapping is something I need to think more about; I've been looking into it for this wiki too (to visually see the references).

I was bored stiff the first couple weeks<<footnote "zip" "we spent decent chunks of two classes learning how to unzip files. YO most of the other students are //younger// than me, why are they so technoilliterate???? I assumed that people my age or younger are obviously competent with computers and tech...but it seems that's not broadly true.">> but since we've gotten into the meat of the course, I'm enjoying it.
<<<

Bored stiff indeed. I once found a rare copy of a mathematical logic textbook we were using for class, and I was chastised for sending them a .djvu file. Two interweb searches away to solve this problem folks (this is usually my fault too).

I have been paying attention to this digital divide. I cannot tell you how many students of mine didn't own a computer (even those who had the money). I knew folks who wrote their papers on a phone (and you could tell!). I work really hard to teach my kids in this arena. The ruling class can (economically, not morally!) afford not to be technoliterate or literate at all (they pay people for that shit), but everyone else has to climb that mountain. It turns out that youth may have grown up with technology, but that doesn't mean they've learned how to wield it (and, I say that as someone with profound holes in his game).

I'm experiencing these pains with my [[Afterschool Teaching]]. I'm also not allowed to teach them what I know, but I may anyway (I'm getting paid just above minimum wage, lol). I think it may be immoral of me not to help them here. Admittedly, these kids have much larger problems to handle. So far, everyone looks like they get enough to eat, but I see what may be flickering markers of abuse and neglect (though I have no idea how to intervene or find the path to helping them). My social skills are pretty fucking awful though.

<<<
 The teacher actually pulled me into his office after I only missed half a point on the midterm to figure out if I was a freshman and encourage me to go into Urban Planning. That was unexpected. I'm helping fellow students more, and have fallen into a nice casual social ease with them (that doesn't always happen for me).
<<<

I am not surprised by the teacher pulling you aside. As usual, I will say the thing you've probably heard your whole life (which is the wrong thing to praise): you are smart (//duh!// ;P). Being praised for your effort, especially when you fail, is more useful to you. I'm not sure how to be useful as your friend here. I aim to praise your resilience, persistence, willingness-to-take-risks, and even not giving a shit what anyone (including me) thinks [[irwartfrr]]. Game recognize game though, and I have failed you not to start with that.

You are a good citizen. FWIW, you seem extremely sociable to me (but, that might just be a sign that you sit at end of particular bellcurves that make it hard for other people to identify with you). Unless sociable just really means playing shallow language games with each other, I wish everyone was as sociable as you.

This is a sensitive subject for me. It is clear that few give a shit enough to move beyond smalltalk or using me a mere means. Often, it feels like I must sell myself to others to demonstrate I'm even worth their time. Friendship is an investment, but most are unopen to the transformation of it (they are [[T4T]] players or worse).

<<<
It made me wonder, the other day, what my life would have been like if I'd gone to this school from the beginning, chosen a major like Urban Planning, formed an early camaraderie with my cohort, moved into the business, and been two years along in my career right now. There's a [[big-fish-little-pond effect|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-fish%E2%80%93little-pond_effect]] going on here.
<<<

It is a good question! It may have been best for your career. I do not know.

My gut instinct is that you will look back and be glad that you had your uChicago experience (which isn't to say you will treasure it or think highly of the people, etc.). I mean you no offense (and please correct my possibly gross misinterpretation), but I think the transformation you experienced at uChicago (which is not to say they: did you any favors, were moral, or were structured correctly) presents itself clearly in our dialectic.

If I attempted to dehabituate and turn off [[The Golden Rule]] inside me, I think I could ruthlessly become quite wealthy and powerful. I have always been wealthy in the simulations I have played, and RL has many of the same cracks. Long have I fought against it in me. I started college at 14, and my idiotic goal was to get an MBA/Econ degree and play stocks (I would very much have enjoyed trading [and worse]). Philosophy has enabled me to tame that beast, I [[hope]]. It has been an uphill battle to become a man who can look at himself in the mirror at the end of the day and decade.

Madame [[Sphygmus]]: what matters to you most and why?

<<<
The third class I've been taking this fall is an intro to cultural anthropology class, and it's easily one of the best classes I've taken. We're probably a group of 30 or 40 in the class most days - distinctly larger than any uChicago discussion class - yet the professor still runs it discussion-style and it's wonderful. She did her PhD at uChicago and I clearly see it in her teaching<<footnote "ivy" "Perhaps it's less uChicago's influence I see and more the general influence of private, Ivy-level education but still.">> and the emphasis on reading scholarly articles & works by those in the field. She handles the class very deftly, taking students' half-formed comments and "what I hear you saying..." them into context with the readings. Plus the class is fucking ''diverse'' in a way that uChicago's classes //never// were and I imagine will never be (barring any dramatic structural changes). This is an 8:30am class and people show up! We've dived into tough topics, listened to each other, gotten hopeful and despairing at the same time - it's dynamic.
<<<

When you say that: I wish you were my teacher (but, I will also tell you there is likely no future in it). You so clearly see it. Your awareness makes me feel stupid (though you don't make me feel bad about it). I'm gonna sound all "get off my lawn" here (my beard is almost more grey than any other color now, for realsies ;P), I didn't see half of what you did at your age. I wish I could be there with you.

<<<
So...my experience with college has significantly changed in this single semester alone. It seems clear to me that uChicago gets something right - the humanities, the Great Human Conversation, reading Plato and Aristotle and Durkheim and Marx and so on - foundational thinkers that are still being wrestled with today. But larger, cheaper<<footnote "well" "in comparison to uChicago, anyway.">> public universities have the diversity and the numbers! And it seems to me that those universities are where vital and dynamic and mind-opening discussion about //important shit// could and should occur.
<<<

`/standing-applause`

I wish public universities were the universities which had all the status, where all the elite professors and top students fought to go. I wish it was a sign of low competence that you couldn't get into a public university and were required to rely upon your family's wealth to attend a lesser private institution. 

<<<
I'm not sure if that makes sense - I'm not sure how best to write it. But basically in retrospect uChicago was a rich, elite bubble where I was out of place during the vast majority of my time there, to my detriment.
<<<

I'm sorry. I felt like that at Tulane too. It's an interesting experience, and it still is. Half of me is very grateful to have the chance to learn, and half of me thinks the institution is an abomination.

I take it you aren't rich, lol (doesn't seem like it to me: you give too much of a shit about people). Again, I understand this is a sensitive topic. I do not see you as failing at all. That bubble is hostile to us. You must have very strong mixed feelings about it. In time, I hope to understand your full picture here (which, again, I think will take time to develop). It is my experience that victims tell their stories in fragments.

<<<
It's tough! Public universities wouldn't have given me the same financial aid<<footnote "syb" "or the same syllabus-level experience?">>, and thankfully, whether uChicago's attempts to increase diversity are just token acts or really genuine, I will be able to finish my degree without any student loan debt. But I really did not have the tools or the support to handle the dramatic class/power difference.
<<<

You bet your ass it's token, but you are clearly a sufficiently valuable token to them. It will always be worth your time to continue thinking about why.

Graduating without debt is awesome. I know it sounds patronizing, so I'm not going to say "I'm proud of you." What I mean to say is: you kicked ass, and I'm really glad it has worked out, even when the odds have been against you.

I hope to come to understand this more richly as you develop your narrative.

<<<
I will keep thinking with you about TiddlyWiki! I have been on a bit of a break from my wiki and/or motivation in general - the winter malaise has really hit me the past couple of weeks. I've considered making larger chunks of my wiki available on /''''/sphygm.us...something I'm going to be thinking about more as well.
<<<

I appreciate it, of course. I understand taking a break too. I, uh, am fairly dependent on my drug here, lol. But, life is a busy whirlwind (I can point to such spots in my wiki too). 

What kinds of things are you considering making public? What rules do you have?

The more I look at Bob, the more I'm convinced it is a tool worth looking at for you. It should be reasonably possible for you to maintain public and private wikis and automate that process more safely. For all I know, you already have a solid process. Bob seems like a damned strong one-stop shop to me.

<<<
I'm doing something different with this letter - I hope you don't mind. I figure you check my site at least on occasion,<<footnote "b" "I apologize for not updating it with any sort of regularity!">> so I'm not going to email a link. My hope is for this to emulate, in some sense, the travel delay time of physical letters and let you see it and reply in your own time. :)
<<<

Fear not. Your updates are a gift to me. I understand being in that whirlwind. Even before you sent this letter, I've been thinking about how I want to watch your site. [[j3d1h]] and I had talked about what we might do, and we stumbled on this: [[Update Scanner|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/]]. I think it works great for your site. I hope to eventually be able to tailor something like it significantly for others.

I want to make it so people have an easy time hyperreading my site automatically. Perhaps, in the end, the dat-like goal is to have people seed it from their browsers, auto-update, and just locally bookmark the pages that I've helped shape for them (or containing the filterlists/macros of the searches they want). I don't know how to make this giant [[RGM]] yet. I hope it is something that I can develop with time.

<<<
See you on another desert hill,

warmly, sphygmus
<<<

One reason I love writing with you is you make it so clear that you think I'm worth your time. In part, from thinking about your words, I continue to look at the relationships around me, and I ask myself, "does that person really want to care about me?" I think my brother [[JRE]] is quietly worried I have some borderline personality disorder (you are free to agree), and he may be correct. In any case, it's my pleasure to spend time keepin' it real with you.

<<<
[[2018.12.08 - Sphygmus: Torrents]]

I just wanted to write a quick note~

I got the letter! Please pass on my thanks to everyone<<footnote "ft" "or - for family time - ''thank you'', everyone!">> - I'm so touched.<<footnote "g" "It is not immediately clear to me how 1uxb0x's game plays out! I love playing card games like durak, hearts, and spades - I'll have to wrangle someone to try his game out with me!">> :)
<<<

Everyone was excited. It kinda felt like a portal to another adjacent world? I don't know. None of us have ever had a penpal become so materialized for us. We captured your thanks in [[2018.12.09 - Family Log: Sphygmus Joins Us]].

My son is growing obsessed with card games. I cannot say the game is worth playing, but he wanted to send a piece of art. I've decided to try [[Magic: The Gathering]] with him again. It has been very productive for us; he has a systematic autistic gift I aim to help him cultivate.

<<<
(Also your business cards are really satisfying in person! Moo cards, by any chance? I bet they would look //dope// on the Moo card stock with the colored edge, too. :D)
<<<

I was thinking about those colored edges. I, uh, didn't know if this was a worthy expenditure or not. The keybase PGP key is already something I will be killing off. Perhaps it's something I'll cycle and iterate over. Next time, I'll shoot for an even flashier card. Unfortunately, I can't say anyone has used them yet (maybe I don't understand the purpose yet). It might just be a token or something. I'm literally trying to connect with people, but I'm failing. I look at the universe and think: "hey universe, uh, you got any more of them [[Sphygmi|Sphygmus]]?" Lol.

<<<
thank you for the tildes invite! I will hopefully remember to actually use it sometime in the near future. I kept meaning to get on their reddit invite threads but never did, so this is perfect.
<<<

Odds are good you are "with it" far more than I am. I didn't stumble across it until recently.

<<<
I appreciate the MAM invite offer! After being on rutracker in high school, I actually interviewed for MAM and then eventually studied and interviewed for What.CD in college. On our first date, we were talking about trackers and my SO broke the news to me that What.CD had been raided - not the heartbreak I expected on a first date ahaha.<<footnote "mu" "I've basically switched to soulseek for my music, with rutracker sometimes filling in the gaps. Soulseek is so much quicker/smoother than trackers even, I feel.">> Now I've just got rutracker, MAM, and - not activated b/c I'm bad at logging in every six months but still - GGn. My SO has a BTN account that I'm //extremely// jealous of<<footnote "mam" "I was shocked to learn he didn't have a MAM account, so I got to gift that to him. 😊">> (and a PTP account but I don't watch enough movies to really care about having a movie tracker account of my own). What do you use for TV? (Acronym away!)
<<<

That is awesome! =) I agree on the beauty of Soulseek. I've never accessed BTN before, so I'm envious too! 

Speaking of your SO, I live in the American South, and I've had multiple people look at me funny when I say I write long letters (well I already get weird looks; writing letters only gets more of them, but even more so because I write them...) to a female who is not my wife (you have to understand, many men here do not have significant female friends, period). I ask this question simply because I've been asked this question by so many people that I would like to be able to answer it, lol: what does your SO think about our penpalling? Further, do you think your SO would be interested in joining the hyperconversation we're having? I am interested to get to know him as well.

I have never participated in the scene, but I climbed the tracker world for a little while. I think I appreciate the incentivization problems. The ingroup/outgroup division justice principle, however, must be built on an open-ended, hospitable [[T42T]]. All other strategies result in a game of perfect competition. I am unhappy with large sections of the piracy world because it aims to privatize [[irwrongfrr]]. The moral justification of piracy is to freely share and decentralize power. What has been built is wrong-headed to me directly because it centralized power, and I believe it is the result of market forces rather than goodwill.

We should be librarians to the world. I am academically and morally opposed to intellectual property;<<ref "bd">> I wish we could decentralize the process for [[Humanity]] (I think highly of those projects which aim to be open even when they fail). To me, moderation and cataloging are human filtering processes, but they must never be centralized or made to benefit only the elite. I want to see tools that allow each of us to choose who we trust for moderation, curation, cataloging, and filtering across anonymized networks. The [[Atropos]] protocol is a beginning attempt (I may have to import the md plugin) at a high-performance network with the correct properties (would write the library in [[Rust]]). 

Currently, I use the reviled: IPT, but I spend my seedboxes primarily on public trackers (since they are the moral approach to me). Nothing else seems to come close for a general tracker (which includes managing dozens of trackers), and it's much easier for my children to reason about a single tracker. Besides MAM and Empornium, IPT is the only tracker I actually use with any consistency. I used to keep others active, but over the years, I've just not seen the point. Other P2P options and Usenet were useful but have waned (Soulseek being this glorious living exception which is easier to use than tooling built on swarms). High-performance decentralization based upon the automated enforcement of the [[T42T]] strategy (per node) is the only scaling virtual private mesh network for the public which I think can defeat the monster I'm staring at.

<<<
Noted about Signal! I can see it being a sleeker way to send quick notes - I'm not sure. I'll think about it!
<<<

Let me know if you prefer another tool. Signal has a lot going for it. It's still, unfortunately, centralized. 

<<<
I've been following the whole Bob rube goldberg machine you've been writing about/working with. I don't really grasp the whole thing but it's interesting nonetheless. I expect I won't be switching to 5.1.18 for a while? I'll have to take a look at the changelog and see if there's any new features I'm immediately interested in.

Cheers!
<<<

You and me both. I'm still figuring out the [[RGM]]. Migrating to 5.1.18 is still in the works too. Thankfully, not everything is ready for 5.1.18, so I have time to figure it out. I've never built anything like this before; it's all new to me.

<<<
[[2018.12.09 - Sphygmus: URI'd]]

dammit! I left your business card and home and didn't get your number in my phone yet - this would be a moment I intuitively reach for an IM type form of communication.<<footnote "but" "on the other hand, being forced into an email format here encouraged me to go deeper than my surface level //cool!// reaction.">>
<<<

Indeed, I love deeper responses. It is tough to juggle and gauge which mediums are fitting. I'm still not sure how to mix instant messaging into our [[hyperconversation]] effectively enough. I can say that most people seem to only engage me in instant messaging, and they don't seem to have any time or interest in long-form expressions or deeper empathic reasoning (but, that may be changing). I realize it is costly (though, I aim to repay it strongly). I will always prefer your long-form, systematic writing. But, surely, someone who spends time writing something which I prize so much should also be able to conveniently access me. I like having a variety of options with you too. =) Sometimes time is of the essence.

Maybe I have the wrong friends and family, lol. Half the people I know barely even try to read or write anything substantial; they act like they don't have time (but, I am not so convinced). Instant gratification drugs are simply too addictively convenient, and I don't think they want to own up to the shallowness (it's costly to do with all the pressures which surround us too). It turns out, being Human well is hard fucking work (it is my privilege to engage in it). Even this letter has taken me almost a month to write!

<<<
I love how you've URI'd my - huh, you didn't use canonical URI for this and did iframe HTML instead? Now -

I think this is where you might use [Rabbitholed] in your wiki pages? I haven't quite figured out what that signals when I see it; I assume it means you started writing about something, opened a new tab to investigate or otherwise dived into it, and didn't continue writing?
<<<

The semantic dam bursts when I rabbithole, and I mark it. It's a manic flowstate wherein I can't say everything I need to say (neither well-organized nor fleshed-out); significant moves in this wiki have resulted from this process (even though my wiki often represents what we think about very poorly). Phenomenologically, it is a triage: too much is happening at once, there are too many breakpoints and forks, too many waypoints we must come back to, and I often have explosions of tiddlers and hyperreading on my screen. 

I often spend this time speaking in person since I cannot even get it out fast enough (I hope to eventually have solid speech-to-text). These sessions often amount to significant dialectics with my family wherein we rapidly wander a large network of thoughts together (I am a draining man to speak with in person at all times, but especially when I'm in the zone). I will often ask, "why did we go down this path?" or "what started this?" or "where were we going?" or step back through the conversation to continue the proof or exploration.

I aim to give my children a graduate school education in philosophy before they are 18 (they already startle the professors here). I shit you not (however insane it may sound): I aim to train my children to eventually become grandmasters in the study of wisdom (or get them as far as they can). Think the Polgár sister prodigies, but instead targeting a game I value above all others: the pursuit of wisdom (as always: [[Virtue is Knowledge]]). Ofc, instrumentally, I want them to be solid computer users (they are a much further along than I was at their age), decent mathematicians (at least for logic, category theory, and perhaps those branches related to AI), and I hope excellent (deep and hyper) readers and writers. I hope I have enough time to equip and cultivate them with everything I can: the desert is dangerous. Admittedly, there is a great deal in this wiki which only they and my wife can effectively interpret as I intend.

Perhaps one day those markers will become more valuable. I do not know. There are many experiments in here. Of course, I may be failing (though I feel like I'm doing my best with what I have; I know it might not look like I'm working hard, but I am). I hope one day, decades from now, my children will fully know how much I love them.<<ref "one">> It is one of my {[[axioms]]} to [[Be A Good Dad]], and I aim to live up to my vocational calling.

So I assumed you used the field _canonical_uri and the text/html value to get our websites embedded, but I was wrong when I checked your tiddler! I had to go back to an old snapshot<<footnote "cool!" "Wow it was really fascinating to go back to old wiki snapshots after living in my current design so much! I like where it's ended up.">> where I knew I had done that because I couldn't remember if I was remembering how _canonical_uri worked - I was half-right! Kicks' site would embed that way, but anything that's JavaScript doesn't seem to work with the uri field method (sphygm.us wouldn't embed with uri for me).

Thank you for teaching me new things! You will find, again and again, I'm just an arrogant skiddie.<<ref "sk">> You may have to sledgehammer this brick wall too. I appreciate your willingness to teach me. There is so much I do not know in the desert. I had no idea one could even do that, lol!

I believe I searched for this function because I wanted to point to [[2018.12.07 - kickscondor: h0p3]] (since it is an uncommitted draft, I must wait) and I was curious about how to respond in [[2018.12.05 - JYU: Thank You For The Gift]].<<ref "hh">> It turned into a toy and perhaps something else. I still don't know how I feel about it. I am a little bit worried about it though, but I can't put my finger on it.

<<<
Anyway I was immediately pleased with how the sphygm.us tiddler worked when I was checking your wiki on my phone!! That flexbox theme is really strong, even embedded inside your wiki.
<<<

Oh, indeed! When I tried embedding your site, I called everyone over to look at it. It looks sick to me.<<ref "sick">> It looked so natural even while embedded. Of course, I might be biased, but I think you have the best looking TW I've seen: it defeats the visual scaling problems excellently too. I do not understand why your work is not the default setting for TW. It's more than lipstick and rouge. In case you don't already, please take your work seriously and consider fighting for it with the devs (admittedly, I have no idea how to do that well). I really think you are onto something! Don't you think your wiki looks and functions wildly better than the default?

They might shoot it down (for who knows what reason), but I think your work (perhaps with some adjustments to fit their criteria) is that fucking good (I was right about BTC's Keeboord too, and some of its essential components are now in 5.1.18 core). You clearly have a designer's eye (even though I do not have your skill, your virtue seems obvious to me). Perhaps that could be an X-mas gift to [[Humanity]]. I do not know enough about it other than that to say: it's clearly good. Perhaps you may need to generalize and specialize it as best as you can (I have no idea; I'm ignorant here). I will argue in full force (or not at all if you ask me to be silent) on your behalf. You are handling an obvious flaw in TW here: the default looks like shit compared to yours. Maybe that blank, ghetto, default flatness is the point though (maybe I'm blind here or something). Obviously, as always, I could be wrong here!

The fact that TW looks ugly compared to the bajillions of slick sites is likely one of the reasons nobody touches it. They glance at it for 2 seconds and walk away. Our species is wired for appearances (understandably in so many cases). Your work doesn't just change the form; it makes your TW functionally superior to the default. 

<<<
(Also, I love visiting your wiki on all my various work computers now because the flex works so well! I'm not used to experiencing the fruits of my creations so directly and so often.)
