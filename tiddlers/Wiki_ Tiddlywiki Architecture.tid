title: Wiki: Tiddlywiki Architecture

I need my daughter's help. I need her to learn how TiddlyWiki works on the inside. She needs to map it out, and to be able to explain how the pieces fit together and what they mean. I need her to be able to teach me. Show me the anatomy.

Once I have mastered it, I will be in a much better position to literally program the wiki and to dream for it.
