!! Audit:

* Unschooling hasn't been terribly productive beyond just getting life situated. 
** Hopefully, they will learn to fly. 
*** If they are going to fail, might as well be now. Lawd knows, they only get one real shot at college.
** It gives us many opportunities to speak, no doubt.
* Surprisingly pragmatic. Lots of little bits.
* This past month, I've actually really needed it. I've relied upon it. I felt naked without it. wat. 
** There were days in which it was the most important log to me. Noice. ;P
* I like that you have you been at least somewhat useful to [[K]] in his schooling (not sure how to have been more useful). It's been ~7 years coming, but he got there. Fuck yeah, dude. Rock on.
* Fascinating to see a message to ulillillia in here.
** It's FTO territory.
* Despite all the work up front, the rollout at our new place has not gone smoothly.
** Smooth enough that your offspring could handle quite a bit though.
*** Everyone has the necessities, even if it hasn't been terribly convenient. Illness has been a bitch.
* We've never had CCs before. Credit smoothed it out for us, and it's nice to be able to pay it back instantly.
** I'm glad we have built and protected her score so thoroughly. Doesn't matter if I live or die, and that's the way it should be.
* My daughter's work in computing has been an abject disappointment again and again and again. =/. 
** I hate showing her that it can be done in a short time frame, and that she had everything she needed to get it done. She's not listening to me.
*** On the flipside, I've enjoyed doing it myself (except the feeling of failing as a father, but there is only so much up to me).
* So weird to be packing a house and hosting guests. I'm glad we went the extra mile.
* Vacation was somehow both relaxing and intense at times. I had a great deal to think about.
** It was an odd culmination of over a year of work in patching ourselves together as a family. I'm grateful.
* We never watched a movie on vacation. In fact, it appears that any of the media and games I chose were going to be incompatible.  
** In the end, I am required to be reserved. I even talked slowly, measured. 
*** I'm a dangerous man to wrestle with in that spot. I will call your entire existence into question if I must. I didn't have to be pleasant, but I'm glad I did.
*** Fascinating to see my offspring doing most of the talking in a way. Hilarious during games how they were like razors.
* The ability to go do something in the tourist trap was an economic measure of how much one would pay to get out of the house.
