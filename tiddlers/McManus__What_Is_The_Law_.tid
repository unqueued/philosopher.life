title: McManus: What Is The Law?

https://quillette.com/2018/08/31/what-is-the-law/

<<<
Similar claims were made by the American and French Revolutionaries, who justified their violent overthrow of the status quo by claiming that the states they lived in violated the natural rights of men and citizens.
<<<

A legal positivist can make this claim (though, they are loath to talk about natural rights). The conceptual analysis of a government is not the same as justification for how one interacts with that government. One can think of natural rights in terms of moral Hohfeldian rights which conflict with some government's Hohfeldian rights (on the positivist's definition). 

Legal positivism doesn't lose all access to moral normativity; their analysis is relevant from a linguistic perspective for giving specific entities names and properties, but justification is another matter entirely. Basically, who gives a shit what normativity-less analysis (whatever that really means) alone tells us? [[The Moral Law]] is the only law that matters; the rest of the laws are all made up and points don't matter except insofar as they are instrumental or constitutive of practicing [[The Moral Law]]. I consider myself a cosmopolitan legal positivist in a farcical way. I point to the Nazi government and say it is conceptually a government (legal positivism lets me do that); I also don't think it's morally justified, and we are morally justified in dismantling it.

<<<
Instead we must develop a moral legal system through cleaning the law of contradictions which destabilize its consistency and integrity.
<<<

Poor fools.

Internalism can never give us objective truths beyond subjective qualia.

<<<
An approach that stresses a fundamental connection between law and morality is obviously attractive for many reasons.
<<<

What kind of fundamental connection?

I agree morality has something to say about everything! Morality is computed, codifiable, and dictates all normativity for moral agents in all contexts. Any other kind of law, however, need not point to [[The Moral Law]] at all; they are mere hypothetical imperatives!

<<<
It is predicated on the belief that the existence (or not) of law is a separate issue from whether or not it is moral. To positivists the job of a legal philosophy is simply to describe what law is, while leaving questions about the morality of this or that legal system to ethicists, activists, and civil society.
<<<

I'm glad nobody reads this. Yeah, this is why I think most people who call themselves legal positivists might be partially retarded (myself included, ofc).<<ref "j">> The ability to distinguish juridical law from [[The Moral Law]] is parallel to the distinction between mere social conventions and [[The Moral Law]]. Yeah, there are people who spend their lives describing various social conventions, but failing to try to understand the morality of those conventions is itself a failure of that agent. 

No one has the moral right to not be thinking about [[The Moral Law]] as it pertains to social conventions, governments, or any other activity (that's why it's [[The Moral Law]]). Nobody has a right not to be an ethicist, including those engaged in legal positivist philosophy. 

Legal philosophy should not happen in a moral vacuum anymore so than mathematics, physics, medicine, or building houses. The question "What ought a legal philosopher study?" is a moral question! Yeah, we're into is/ought territory here. I'm here to wrestle these fucktards because I think they are attempting to confabulate their way to egoism and abdicate their moral responsibilities in their conceptual analysis of law. 

What does it mean to do mathematics virtuously or well? MacIntyre points us to [[The Good]] of a practice. However, the moment [[The Right]] is added, normativity is transformed. Virtue definitionally requires we talk about practices as moral practices inescapably. I can look at a math equation and call it math, and I can look at a law or government and call it such. How I'm supposed to be engaged in mathematics or legal philosophy, however, is still a moral matter. I'm not letting legal positivists off the "for the sake of which" telic train.

<<<
 To a legal positivist, law is a descriptive phenomena first and foremost and, up to a point, can be approached in a manner similar to a science.
<<<

Science might not be the right word here, but okay, I'm not sure what to call it either. I completely agree that they take themselves to be in the business of description. They are delusional for thinking there isn't an objective prescription for how to engage in describing. They never actually disentangle themselves from morality. 

<<<
Secondly, contemporary legal positivists do not have to justify any given legal system to its subjects.
<<<

I think "do not have to" is a weasel phrase. They take themselves not to be obligated to do so. That doesn't mean they aren't obligated to justify legal systems. You know what makes a virtuous doomsday device creator? Presumably, it includes not actually creating such a device. These people don't get to help themselves to practice philosophy (or anything else) outside of [[The Moral Law]].

<<<
Instead of stressing the need to develop a logical ‘concept of law’ that applies everywhere, we should look at what actual legal officials do and how any given system of law operates in practice.
<<<

I'm sorry, what's the difference again? I know it's supposed to be obvious, right? We're playing a language game here. Conceptual analysis can't make sense of itself. I think legal positivists can take themselves to be performing the latter, though you also invoke the word "should," which [[The Moral Law]] dictates by definition. 

<<<
Moreover, realists and critical theorists argue we should cease believing that any given interpretation of what law is can be value neutral.
<<<

Agreed. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to point to anything which is value neutral (a claim that many moral philosophers find unintuitive).

<<<
For instance, they will point to the following paradox: the belief that value neutrality is a disciplinary virtue is itself not value neutral.
<<<

Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to need an example of anything which is value neutral. I literally can't come up with one. [[The Moral Law]], however it is dialectically related to [[The Good]] and [[The Beautiful]], is totalitizing.
