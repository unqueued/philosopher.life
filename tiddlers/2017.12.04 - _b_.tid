My brother asked me what I thought about affirmative action, the concept of racism, and the issues of responding to "Black Lives Matter" with "All Lives Matter." My response was egalitarian and socialist. I think this is a matter of classism and material dialectics. He seemed less-than-satisfied by it.

One thing we didn't explore well enough is how the largest beneficiaries of affirmative action have been rich blacks and white women. Essentially, affirmative action should be targeting the poor, those who lack opportunities and essentially applying the maximin principle.

I continue to not be careful enough in my uses of the words egoism and psychopathy.

Most of the time, when I say egoism, I'm talking about psychological egoism, the description of creatures as selfish. I often call this my fundamental redpill. There are, of course, prescriptions of selfishness, which is classically what we think of as egoism. Sometimes I use the word that way as well.

Psychopathy is having the ability to empathize (affectively, cognitively, or motivationally), but electing not to (although, there are those that claim they cannot, I have questions about their understanding of possibility). Psychopaths are habitual in particular sets of contexts in electing not to empathize. This is, of course, very fuzzy. One can easily imagine someone who has put themselves into a lifestyle and context in which they regularly empathize with those around them, but can only do so by electing not to empathize with humanity. Their brain might not appear to be psychopathic given a standard clinical diagnostic, but doctors are terrible philosophers. 

Egoism and psychopathy obviously have strong links, but they are not the same thing. I should be far more careful in how I wield them.
