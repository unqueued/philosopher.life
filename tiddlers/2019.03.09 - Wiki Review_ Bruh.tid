title: 2019.03.09 - Wiki Review: Bruh

* [[Music: Curation & Playlist Tools]]
** Sick tools, bruh.
* [[2019.03.08 - Music Exploration: Phil]]
** I'll send him the tool if he wants to have an open spotify playlist available.
* [[Atomic Habit Cheatsheet]]
** Not sure what I feel about it yet.
* [[2019.03.08 - Link Log: Dump]]
** I'm like 3 pounds lighter now.
* [[2019.03.08 - Afterschool Teaching: TGIF]]
** A fine day. I can only assume my refusal to censor their books and computer usage is going to bite me in the ass some day. A man's gotta have a code.
* [[2019.03.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Sacrifice]]
** It is done. I'm so happy.
** I need to start drawing more up. I like having particulars to walk through.
* [[2019.03.08 - Prompted Introspection: Dream House]]
** Stupid fucking question. Who made these?
* [[2019.03.08 - Wiki Review: Sensitive]]
** I aim to celebrate sensitivity [[irwartfrr]]. It's clear that the people I admire most have been extremely sensitive (which doesn't mean they weren't lacking sensitivity ever).
* [[2019.03.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Imagination]]
** I wonder how many adults stop choosing to live in imaginary worlds. I can see it in my children so often. I did at that age too. I still do from time to time. I suppose I may lose it altogether. I hope not.
* [[2019.03.08 - TDL: Shop]]
** It's such a surreal experience to look at my [[TDL]] and...be happy!
* [[2019.03.08 - Phil Nunnally:]]
** I'm so grateful that people give me time here. I feel like I'm slogging slow motion through this wiki.
* [[2019.03.08 - Computer Musings: Fans]]
** I'm not giving up yet! That machine is a beast.
