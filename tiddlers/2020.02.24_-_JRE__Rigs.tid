Rebecca's grandpa's nickname was Rigs.  When I heard that I decided that will be Matthew's new name.

Had a fun talk with [[j3d1h]], although I fucked up and turned it into an electrician lesson:  she said she will do a few of the art lessons.  I sent her a link to the guy for her to pick out some dates so I could sign her up.  Told her to coordinate with you on dates.  Any chance you could ask her what days were looking best?
Mon 11:28am
Will do now.

She doesn't seem to have a preference. I would prefer during the weekdays if my preference matters here.

Sundays are off limits.

I don't think turning it into an electrician lesson is a bad thing. I often tell them to listen carefully to you in that field to understand what consists in mastery, what it feels and sounds like, how it's talked about, etc.
Mon 11:31am
Classes between. 2pm and 8pm.  Assume 2pm is best, yeah?
Mon 11:32am
That'd be great.
Mon 11:32am
Would be home in time for dinner too.

I'll sign her up for one this week and one the next if he is available.

Noice. She's gonna have a blast.
Mon 11:36am
I'm excited.
