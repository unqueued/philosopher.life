If you see something like this at the top of the page:

<<<
PH: Today
<<<

...then you are looking at a page which I hope to fill out in some future time period.

This a quick way to force the creation of a link and a way to generate peace of mind when I feel overwhelmed by my mind-mapping.

I've been thinking about {[[About]]} as PH, but I've been working on it for months. PH is a "work in progress," it's not complete enough for me to remove that. PH is a "pre-Alpha" testing a page; it's literally development itself. It's debugging and adding until I've got something I appreciate.
