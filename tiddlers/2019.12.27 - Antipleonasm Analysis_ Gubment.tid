!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights, deprive you of your economic opportunities, deprive you of decent housing, deprive you of decent education. You donâ€™t need to go to the employer alone, it is the government itself, the government of America, that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country.

You conspiracy theorist, you! Shame, I tell you: shame! Insofar as our government is an oligarchically-controlled layer backed by reactionaries to impose the will of the wealthy on everyone else, I agree with all of your claims, sir. I'm not a fan of just talking shit about "gubment" if we aren't going to wrestle for further progress on deeper or more accurate descriptions of the causality of our problems with authority. I realize we have to begin with a shallow idea or story, but it's something we have to grow to do anything about.
