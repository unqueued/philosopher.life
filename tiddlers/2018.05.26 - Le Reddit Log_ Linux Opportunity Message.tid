I am employed by Red Hat.

We have a bunch of opportunities available.

I'm willing to give you a chance. PM me.

This is out of the blue, and if it's inappropriate, I'm sorry. The worst you can say is "no," and I'd kick myself later for not saying anything.

I would like a chance at any opportunity you may have available. I've been using Linux (usually Debian-based or CentOS) on my servers and devices for 8 years. I love to build, fix, and maintain tools and services which are useful and reliable, and I want a chance to get to the next level.
