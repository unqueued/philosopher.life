!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
We live in weird times in which we are compelled to behave as if we are free, so that the unsayable is not our freedom but the very fact of our servitude.

Can I have your babbies, [[Ziz]]? To be clear, he's speaking of political autonomy, not moral autonomy. Further, this compellation is as old as primitive language use. But, I know he knows this as well. Sovereignties (and I'm maximally inclusive here) and the centralizations of power (weasel word time) //naturally// tend to defend themselves, often unjustifiably in these cases.

One of the reasons (though hardly the most important, and arguably one of the more sinister) religious (and plenty of philosophical) memeplexes evolved and spread like wildfire were in virtue of their ability to control and coordinate tribes which sublated others in material dialectics. Conceptual analysis of freedom has always been contentious in all social spheres. Our ability to be ourselves, to be unconstrained by others and our environments, and some Spinozistic notion of [[power]] as our ontological essence is not something which egoistic and unjustified masters in dialectics aim to enable or cultivate. Distinctions between mere social norms and objective moral requirements have never received enough attention. 

Among [[pleft]]ists, I am radically in favor of freespeech rights, especially in virtue of variations of this kind of problem (to a point where I find only alt-[[pright]]ists and hedged-conservative anarchists who agree with me), but I am also more convinced of the necessity of violence in [[The Golden Rule]] than most feel comfortable exploring. There are high political and personal costs we must pay to defeat Orwell and Huxley's demons, and that includes not only describing our unjustified servitude but also how we will defeat our enemies.
