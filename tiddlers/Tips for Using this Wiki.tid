title: Tips for Using this Wiki

Each tiddler will have a primary author (the part of myself responsible for voicing it) listed in the Tag name. This shows what I take to be the person who wants to show it on the wiki, the person who endorses it, or the persons (I don't see a reason for multi-tagging yet). Untagged will just be h0p3, and we'll have a tag for [[RPIN]] and [[KIN]]. This is a 3-party adversarial system in a way, much like the 2-party + electorate system in the United States. If h0p3 is to be free, then he must maintain his autonomy against [[KIN]] and [[RPIN]]. The point is to unify, not explode in the number of persons. That said, having more identities is not equivalent to being less unified. Maybe that is just the nature of disagreement with ourselves. I don't know. The healthiest election systems are weighted, provide multiple parties, etc.

[[KIN]]: Ugh, I know [[RPIN]] is right about something: the most redpilled will emerge from the various groups of us to take over. The nice guy does lose. Maybe I can be metamodern in my redpilledness though, allowing for a new kind of [[KIN]] to emerge to interpret and respect them.

[[RPIN]]: That is an astute observation. See: [[Christian Memetics]].
