!! If you had a week to live, how would you live it?

Lol. 

Does this question assume I know I only have a week to live? If I don't know that, then I assume I'd just carry on as I usually do. Presumably, I would know in this scenario, otherwise, the question is kind of dumb.

How would I die? Can it be mitigated? Can the pain be avoided? I assume I don't know and I can't do much or anything about it.

I have already thought about this before. It is one of my methods for alleviating myself of suicidal ideation, particularly when I'm on the brink. I say to myself, "well if you are going to die, you might as well make it worthwhile for your family." In fact, that's why I'm pursuing pipefitting. This is a long-term based solution to suicidal ideation. It's a way of getting the most for my family before I die in a way that I can live/die with. 

Since I only have a week, the answers are pretty simple:

* My first few days would be spent for my family (and if I failed in that time period, all of my days would be).
** I'd Robinhood wealthy people of assets, pushing as much into cryptocurrency for my family as possible.
** I'd attempt to find ways to incur non-transferable debt. 
** //Spree// would be an apt word.

* My last few days would be spent with my family. I'd immediately call my family and tell them to take off work because I was going to die. 
** We'd party. I'd like to die on the beach.
** My family knows how much I love them. I tell them often. I'd say it again. 

Executive functioning in such compressed spaces of time creates very odd incentives and behaviors. I'd likely give up on most or all of my bucket list. My family's welfare is all that matters. I think I'd be being selfish in spending my time with rather than for them, except perhaps my last day. 

The question has interesting implications for possible end-of-the-world kinds of scenarios as well.

My empathy for humanity runs dry in this question.
