** I'm still not sure why someone would build shitty ransomware. It's bad for the "effective" bad guys though, as it may lower the bar of trust. 
* [[2017.07.03 - Retired: {Focus}]]
** I've noticed that I've been shuffling logs around still. Some seem worth it, and some don't. That's the natural way of things.
* [[2017.06 - Link Log]]
** I think I should just automate the process of going through my links. Make a python script which converts the bookmarks to something palatable. Perhaps my daughter can write the script.

** I'm extremely grateful to my brother. He has offered to help us with money if we needed it. And, I haven't taken him up on it. I didn't want to unless it was absolutely necessary. He decided to just give us money anyway. I hope I can find a way to repay him back.
* [[AB&T Buylist]]
** I'm so excited by even the possibility of owning any of these tools.
