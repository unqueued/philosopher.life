title: 2018.07.31 -- CATI: Quaternions

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion

<<<
The quotient of two directed lines in a three-dimensional space[3] or equivalently as the quotient of two vectors

You need to know I've never had Calculus. In fact, I barely know Trig. My math is wacky. You're going to have to speak to an idiot here, but my quantitative reasoning is better than most would suspect.

Sounds like a form or [[dok]] of dialectic to me (but, ofc, I see them everywhere in everything all the way down, inside and out!), at least some very simplified, particular version of it. Maybe it is a class of dialectics.

To my understanding, there is a special reductive relationship of everything above [[SO]] reasoning down to the [[SO]]. Does such a relationship exist within Quaternions of higher order/vector?

My gut instinct towards imaginary numbers is modalogical possible worlds. Think carefully about my gut instinct, please.

 The fundamental formula:

    `i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1` 
<<<

Okay, going back to classical logic, hold my hand please. Identity is a predicate which allows different names (with functions) and/or variables to pick out the same objects in our domain. I read this as saying that i², j², and k² pick out the same object in our domain. More importantly, ijk and -1 also pick out that same object. I will be very interested to see the logical equivalences that arise from these identities.

That's a fucking mind-bending thing to say. I cannot even begin to fathom the claim. This is what's really getting me:

`i² = j² = k² = -1` = `ijk`

That's a special relationship right there. Big structures rise from it (or it is a perceptual grid for cutting through a slab of marble to find the sculpture). It's impossible feeling too. I'm trying to fully appreciate its non-commutativity.

`ij = k`,  `jk = i`,  `ki = j` 

`ji= −k`,  `kj =−i`,  `ik = −j`

This paper is the best explanation I've found so far, but I'm barely understanding it. Will require multiple passes, and even then, I suggest I will not see it.

FUCK YEAH! Linked to the concept of time.

Talking out my ass even harder:

[Lead] vs [3 Underlings]

3 underlings Trinity, unstable political structure, dialectic which gives rise to a sublator. Both Lead and the sublator of 3 underlings are in dialectic now.

8-D space

I'm especially interested in the 10th and 11th? dimensions.

Videos are apparently very good. I will see them. Thank you Adam! This is the right track for me. MOAR!

Real numbers span from -∞ to +∞, start adding imaginary vectors.

Four fundamental forces; Four types/dimensions of numbers (starting/built on the Real).

What I had was an out-of-control intuition that these algebras were key to understanding particle physics, and I was willing to follow this intuition off a cliff if need be. Some might say I did.

May Russell, Nash, Gödel serve as your examples. Think carefully in this sphere. Furthermore, remember: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_language_argument.

Alright, so complex numbers give a special kind of impossible vector that's still ridiculously useful as a descriptor. It's 2-D, fo' sho'. Quaternions are 4-D HELLO [[4DID]]. They are fundamental to experience of any sort, perhaps. Sounds like time.

* Positive Pattern: `ij = k`,  `jk = i`,  `ki = j` 
* Negative Pattern: `ji= −k`,  `kj =−i`,  `ik = −j`

Hello Dialectic! Rise from the flatness! k sublates ij, i sublates jk, j sublates ki, -k sublate ji, etc. Or, sublation appears to require emergence. The emergence (or cause) here is the sublation.

Cyclical patterns require more thought. Does a spiral arise from the cycle? Show me. There you find the passage of time, the Being of Becoming, the wrestling of Being and Non-Being, perhaps. Let us not get our hopes up too fast. The leap to [[The Telos]] will require something which even physics will only be able to point towards. Remember the fundamental limits of language about the infinite. Hello Gödel.

I also want to glibly point out that 7 is a holy number. The Real and the Seven Imaginary dimensions.

Dissociation is a very important topic to me. That is literally how I take myself to be changing myself. To operate on myself in autonomy. There is some special relationship among my timeslices, and dissociation and association in at the heart of it. I know we are talking about math here. The words, however, are not lost on me.
