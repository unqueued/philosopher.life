* Alarm got me. Half-brained sleep. DCK, meh.
* Quick surf/write while I got ready for the day.
* Worked hard.
* Came home, peeled out clothes, talked to my wife.
* Turned down for Informing the Men (she was out of spoons, but spooning gives you spoons, I swear).
* ARAM
* Had burgers! =)
* Watched GoT and John Oliver.
* Pushed Bricks.
* Finished wiki, maybe Fireman Time (probably not), and sleep. I need to sleep.
