title: 2020.01.15 - DeathOfRobinhood: The mystery of iniquity

You've warned me somewhere not to get into theodicy with you. This email may be a drunk text I regret. Please don't be harsh, my crime is unpremeditated. 

I can accept (who am I to claim I can 'accept' or 'reject' anything?) suffering in the world (in abstract), I can accept unjust suffering (my faith system is built on it; we even tend to lionize those who suffer unjustly, attributing an extra-bright halo of innocence or nobility on those who suffer such), but I don't know how to make sense of what you call 'moral luck'. 

I hate that a person who's had shitty things done to them, particularly as a kid, is more likely to go on to perpetuate shittiness upon others as an adult. 

I know I don't have to unpack this for you. You appreciate this. 

The rote Christian response to this, I think, is to be like Jesus, and dive headfirst into the latrine and sponge up the sin until it forms an asthenospheric crust under your fingernails. To give yourself utterly to the broken, the dying, the killers and the breakers; to bet it all on Santa's Little Helper with no guarantee you'll get a Christmas Miracle for your trouble at the end. 

`:interlude:`

I've had a couple of hours to think and pray. The rest of this will remain spontaneous and unedited, but will be less turbulent. 

To be able to say anything about 'ought' at all, you have to be able to say 'ought' about a kid bring drafted into the LRA, even as it amplifies your armchair hypothetical-guy power level. In his case, the moral imperative might be something like 'ought to choose to be horribly killed rather than turn a knife on his own parents and then continue to participate in the infliction of violence upon others in perpetuity'. The same imperative that holds up his impossible 'ought' ought to apply to you and me in our contexts as well. That is, we should be radically committed to not-destruction even if it means courting destruction ourselves. Whether there is a resurrection or not may be a matter of faith, but, assuming we hold the previous assertion to be true (and I am not skilled enough to be able to argue the truth of this to its root), we might, by instinct, feel that the evil we are capable of far outweighs our capacity to be not-evil while maintaining an instinct to self-preserve. This has radical practical consequences on the nature of the 'ought' that hangs over our lives, and we are tempted to take refuge in Christ's own assertion that "None are good except God" or else face the horror of our own responsibility. 

This doesn't solve my 'why' problem, but it helps with the despair somewhat. 

Despair is an enemy. I know a man who is paralyzed save for two fingers, who goes to great effort to communicate an impression of non-despair (which at least suggests a measure of caring), and who is therefore in the 'lucky' position of being free to make greater moral choices than someone who sees nothing but an infinite spiral of doom and inconsequence beneath their feet. 

I started this letter because I didn't know what else to say to God in light of some new information I received today. Self-destructive people rarely just destroy themselves without casualties, and my heart ached, and I thought you might have something to say about moral luck. 

Hope the end of this letter finds you well. Sorry if it was confusing/angering; I'd assumed you'd given me the right at some point to confuse/anger you if it came from the heart.
