```
How was your week, [[Jop]]?
JAN 4 8:31 PM
It was ok. Today I went to a funeral. It's my first time here. I was so nervous and excited in the same time.
JAN 4 8:46 PM
Ah, whose funeral?
JAN 4 8:46 PM
Sorry it made you nervous. How does it compare to the Thai tradition?
JAN 4 8:46 PM
How are the girls doing?
JAN 4 8:46 PM
She's a mother of my friend.
JAN 4 8:46 PM
Ah.
JAN 4 8:46 PM
How's your friend taking it?
JAN 4 8:47 PM
Ok one question at a time. Not to fast sir.
JAN 4 8:47 PM
lol, sorry.
JAN 4 8:47 PM
It's a lot different. Here I think more simple and seems faster.
JAN 4 8:50 PM
The girls are with grandparents.
JAN 4 8:51 PM
I went by myself.
JAN 4 8:51 PM
How about you?
JAN 4 8:51 PM
=)
JAN 4 8:52 PM
I'm doing okay. Working hard.
JAN 4 8:52 PM
Kids aren't working hard, and that drives me crazy.
JAN 4 8:52 PM
As usual, reading and writing my butt off.
JAN 4 8:52 PM
How's [[k0sh3k]] doing?
JAN 4 8:53 PM
Still chuggin' along. She's become the librarian they couldn't do without. She's been teaching a lot of classes in her church too. It's been busy but good.
JAN 4 8:54 PM
I am so glad to hear that she is being a great lady as usual. Same as you, writing your butt off as usual.
JAN 4 8:55 PM
How about you, what you been up to?
JAN 4 8:56 PM
Not much, I can't wait till the school get back.
JAN 4 8:58 PM
You guys have had a long break.
JAN 4 8:58 PM
Why can't you wait?
JAN 4 8:59 PM
So the kids can go to school and I can go back to work. I am not good at staying home in a long period that is drive me nuts.
JAN 4 9:00 PM

JAN 4 9:00 PM

JAN 4 9:01 PM
