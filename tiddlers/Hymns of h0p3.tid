//Even with an auditory processing disorder, I suppose [[I know that feel|Phenomenology]] of opiate-hymns. With vulnerable trust, I have reaped it since I was a child. However contradictorily, most of that part of me now reactively cries: ''don't fucking touch me''. I collect the chips of songs on my shoulder like armor. It is much easier to listen to my drugs than attend to their words. Too often, the words attached to music remind me of their meaninglessness. No, I do not commit myself, my tentpegs, to the words of songs: only their meaningful sounds. I push the button, bask in the [[beautiful]] shadows and reflections of the fire of [[The Sun]], and move on toward that blinding transcendence one finite bitstep at a time. I intentionally wander in the desert to unlose and unloose myself. I am lucky to happen upon any oasis in the desert of the real, and, therefore, I must dispel the mirages which mislead me.//

//Especially in music, I have found endless rhetorical lies in local simulations and mere hyperrealities, hence my wrestling pursuit of uncertain universalizable reason and heuristical intersubjectivity. While I pursue [[The Object]] of my awe, I work hard to make sense of not trusting myself qua my religious experiences until I have no other choice. Upon painful reflection of having lost my faith, an application of process theology in constructively invalidating my memories and timeslices of my [[4DID]] to some [[dok]], my religious experiences with respect to lyrical music have come to appear shallow, too easily artificially induced, dark-triadically manipulated, and blackhat-hacked. It is all too easy to fool myself. It's my qualia that some qualia has no practical merit outside theoretical necessity.//

//No, foolishly, I seek The Word of [[Salience]]. In openly doing so, perhaps I will kindly prove myself wrong again and again. Until then, these bridges stay as burned as I can keep them while I jealously guard and slowly cultivate my blind faith with outlandish hedged-conservatism. The [[Self-Dialectic]] requires openness, toleration of change and possibility, to make meaningful progress at all. Of course, without closure, I must incompletely point to the completely ineffable as wisely as I can. Thus, at best, lyrics are merely the static breadcrumbs and hooks which lead to the threshold of the field of waves between mystical sound and sublime silence. Without [[faith]], [[ITS]], words are only shadows of what they abstractly represent. I can hear the concrete. Perhaps hypocritically, [[I|h0p3]] cannot say there is much [[hope]] in this space. I think if you could walk in my shoes, you would not respect most of this part of me either.//

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
```

!! [[Everybody Hurts|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc]]:

```
When the day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no

Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts

No, no, no, no you are not alone

```
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world, mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world, mad world

Enlarging your world
Mad world

!! [[The Sound of Silence|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4]]:

```
Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening

People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"

But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said
"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound
Of silence"
```

!! Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence:

```
Let all mortal flesh keep silence,
and with fear and trembling stand;
ponder nothing earthly-minded,
for with blessing in his hand ,
Christ our God to earth descendeth,
our full homage to demand.

King of kings, yet born of Mary,
as of old on earth he stood,
Lord of lords, in human vesture,
in the body and the blood,
he will give to all the faithful
his own self for heav'nly food.

Rank on rank the host of heaven
spreads its vanguard on the way,
as the Light of light descendeth
from the realms of endless day,
that the pow'rs of hell may vanish
as the darkness clears away.

At his feet the six-winged seraph,
cherubim, with sleepless eye,
veil their faces to the presence,
as with ceaseless voice they cry,
"Alleluia, alleluia,
alleluia, Lord Most High!" 
```

!! [[Hallelujah|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRP8d7hhpoQ]]:

```
I’ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a vict'ry march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it’s not a cry that you hear at night
It’s not somebody who's seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
```

!! Amazing Grace:

```
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch; like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

The Lord hath promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.
```

!! Be Thou My Vision:

```
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
Thou my best thought, by day or by night;
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father and I, Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise;
Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart;
O King of glory, my treasure Thou art.

O King of glory, my victory won;
Rule and reign in me ’til Thy will be done;
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall;
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

Come on!
Ugh!

Come on
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never edit
The needle I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close to the
Rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak movements cease when their heads are flown
Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (what!) the judges (what!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Yeah!
Yeah, back in this!

With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I gotta I got to, what do I gotta to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up
Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

What was the price on his head? 
What was the price on his head?

I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot

"Black Nationalism... [...]
[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism..."

"Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them..."

"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."

Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!

How long?
Not long
'Cause what you reap
Is what you sow
