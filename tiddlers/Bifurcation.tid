title: Bifurcation

We have complex lives. Ha. Yes. It's true. It is such a simple and obvious sentence that I can barely type it out.<<ref "1">> 

That complexity, the continuous complexification of our lives, is a core existential problem. It is a unique kind of factor in our life equation. Every step we take, a zillion doors open and close. 

Our complexity, our conflict shows itself as a bifurcation. But, this// just is// what problem solving is about. 

Welding our practical and theoretical selves is necessary for unification, but it isn't always possible. We have to accept that we aren't naively monolithic creatures at times. That's what self-conflict is all about.
