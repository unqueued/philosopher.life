title: BAGD: Long-term CS Tools

//Yet another one of these. It's so expensive to own your computers. I have to pick tools that I'm convinced will last you decades and begin the learning curves of a wide-breadth of ecosystems, idioms, environments, and perspectives as early as possible. I'm underequipped, untalented, and too foolish to do this well enough. I'm trying to narrow down a list for ya. I hope you'll be able to look back and say I tried my best. By many means, have fun with your computers, but sharpen yourself here, become proficient in a foundation of tools (some of these are infeasibly large) that aren't likely to disappear. These are only part of the equation.//
