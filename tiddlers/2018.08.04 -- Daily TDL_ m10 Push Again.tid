title: 2018.08.04 -- Daily TDL: m10 Push Again

* I need to continue to get m10 tweaks completed. I need to prepare for the eventual move to NPM here.
** nvim
** VM
** vpncloud
** Dropbox
* Call JRE, MB, and C
* Rest of family heading to Knoxville for nephew
* Planning trip to VA. My mother-in-law R is doing very poorly.
** Checked her blog because my wife was concerned about some grammar mistakes which is extremely unlike my mother-in-law. We talked about the structure and content for a bit; something wasn't normal about it. R must be having a really rough day today. =(
