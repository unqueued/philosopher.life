title: 2018.09.06 -- Computer Musings: Brother's Computer

Helped my brother install signal on his desktop. Hooked my brother up to zerotier and installed nomachine. He had to create a password for his account as well. We should be good to go for remoting in now.

It's interesting to be googling for someone else.

Setting up a windows machine with the basics for him.

`yaourt -S beaker-browser-bin` 

Tried this early on ([[The Legacy Link Heap]]). Tried it again just for funsies, and didn't love it. Try it again?

Because I'm a bad person:

`sudo npm install -g dat`

I fucking hate Ubuntu sometimes. Ugly hack to get an up to date copy of npm to eventually run:

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`

Debian on RPi required some /etc/apt work. Manjaro is the only ez mode for me.

The commandline tools are significantly nicer than the beaker browser itself. Perhaps IPFS should be added as well.

I'm such a lazy fucker with permissions. 


```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo npm install -g dat
mkdir wiki-dat
mkdir bin
cd bin
nano lazy_dat_sync.sh
sudo chmod +x lazy_dat_sync.sh
```

...

`sudo dat clone dat://554d20f199f556fed81a5f5ee72ca4544f470a47011cffce7dbf95b54e32d8ff/ /home/h0p3/wiki-dat`

`sudo crontab -e`

`* * * * * /home/h0p3/bin/lazy_dat_sync.sh`

Oh, yeah: [[lazy_dat_sync.sh]] and [[lazy_dat_share.sh]]

Fuck it. I really do hate getting it to work on ARM. Rust is fine. But, when I have to go through multiple ecosystems to get anything to fucking compile...ugh.

Need to redo the milligan thing. Will have pure CLI build ready. Might as well go manjaro at that point. She's not using it either.
