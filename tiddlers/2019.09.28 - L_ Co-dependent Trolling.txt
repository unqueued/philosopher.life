How's your week been?
SEP 28 8:50 PM
Hey [[h0p3]]! I think all in all it was a meh week. Had some bad mental health days the beginning of the week but was more okay by the end of it. So it evens out.
SEP 28 8:58 PM
What about you?
SEP 28 8:59 PM
I am glad to see you survived.
SEP 28 8:59 PM
Ah, I'm hanging in there. Glad to have my vidja.
SEP 28 8:59 PM
They can certainly help with hanging in there. Are you and [[JRE]] still playing together?
SEP 28 9:06 PM
Yup.
SEP 28 9:07 PM
It's been fun. =)
SEP 28 9:08 PM
Noice. Games are always way more fun with a buddy.
SEP 28 9:08 PM
Unless you're [[K]] and I and just troll each other until we get mad lol
SEP 28 9:08 PM
Lol.
SEP 28 9:08 PM
I do that with [[k0sh3k]] too. I'm awful to play MC with. 
SEP 28 9:08 PM
hehehehehe
SEP 28 9:09 PM
[[K]] always tells me he married me so he could annoy me for the rest of my life xD
SEP 28 9:10 PM
=)
SEP 28 9:10 PM
Co-dependent trolling.
SEP 28 9:11 PM
a.k.a. marriage
SEP 28 9:11 PM
it's true. =)
SEP 28 9:11 PM
lolol
SEP 28 9:11 PM
Hey, gotta keep each other company somehow honestly.
SEP 28 9:11 PM
I think our marriage is more 80/20. I think I do the trolling 80% of the time.
SEP 28 9:12 PM
So what I'm hearing is, your love language is trolling
SEP 28 9:14 PM
Lol.
SEP 28 9:15 PM
I would argue it depends on the context. I aim to be whatever she justifiably needs me to be in the circumstances. Usually, a trollolololol.
SEP 28 9:16 PM
Considerate* trolling
SEP 28 9:16 PM
That's the way I am with everyone I love. =)
SEP 28 9:17 PM
Exactly hehe
SEP 28 9:21 PM
I think to some extent I am too -- I don't pick on people I don't like. I am absurdly polite to them because I want nothing to do with em.
