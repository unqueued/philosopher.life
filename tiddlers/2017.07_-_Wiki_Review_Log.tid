!! Audit:

* I dropped the [[Diet Log]]. I think it is reasonable.
* I was obviously very well aware of the lack of DCK this month, throughout the month.
* Almost entirely "Log" work at this point. There are some projects that crop up here and there. That's okay for now, right? In time, this will change.
* The [[Wiki Review Log]] seems to be part of the core heartbeat of the wiki. Am I using it wisely enough? It's definitely not nothing. It sometimes seems inane. It's there though. I see my reflection on the page, and I get to reflect on my reflection as well.
* I need to bring "Brief" back. =) 
** Pour one out for my crazy sociology teacher /libation
* A budget tool would be nice. If I could just auto-sum columns in tables, that would be enough for me. I need my daughter's help.
* Without cannabliss and DCK, and because I refuse to use significant amounts of alcohol, orgasms are one of the few drugs I have left to use. It shows up strongly this month.
** I'd like to thank my wife, my hand, my blanket, countless pornstars, and my brain.
* I've clearly had several important conversations with my brother. I'm very glad to have him as my friend.
* Future me is annoyed at past me for blank "edits." Sometimes is fine. There are too many here without context. Give me your reasoning!
* I miss being in bed with my wife for all the reasons.
* Let me reiterate: accounts are a good idea. This is the core of advanced familial budgeting. 
* A link edit inside [[2017.07.24 - Wiki Review Log]]. Syntax, yo!
* I really do want to do more philosophy. I've just not been doing it. Some of my reasons good, others not. I would argue I'm applying philosophy. I'm being practical. We shall see.
* Edit, edit edit. How about: Brief!
** Rofl...and the next wiki review log said about the same thing. Hilarious!
* I'm not doing a deep read through. Should I follow the tree, at least one layer deep? My memory is not perfect, obviously. This may be worth doing.
