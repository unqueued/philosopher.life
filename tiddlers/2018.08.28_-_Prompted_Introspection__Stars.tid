title: 2018.08.28 - Prompted Introspection: Stars

!! How do you feel when you stare at the stars?

A lightcone, the limits of my observation, a feeling that [time, identity, and change] are illusory, an interconnectedness and drive towards Henosis, mixed feelings of awe and boredom. I feel contradiction. I don't stare at the stars too often.
