title: 2019.05.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Save the Oppressed

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The United States is not going in there to save the oppressed.

This is one of the key markers between [[pright]] and [[pleft]] to me: are you a cosmopolitan who believes your birth is a morally arbitrary characteristic and the wealthy of the Earth are morally obligated to spend it on the poor? The [[pleft]] is far more likely to agree to the truth. 

Plenty of Libertarians can claim the above with an air of superiority when only a select few capitalists are making money by exploiting others through warfare. Ah, but you'll find many will change their minds when capitalists of an entire nation are going to benefit from it; we'll call it defense (of our wealth) in those cases. At best, they will claim that the free market is the only and best possible solution for the global poor. They don't give a shit about others except egoistically; they are happy to lie to themselves and others. These people have already forfeit their lives in how they choose to believe and behave.

The problem is that just war exists. I hate that war could ever be moral, but even [[T42T]] requires it of us in at least some contexts. There must be just warfare on unjust warfare. War comes in many [[dok]], and the free market is one of them. Slavemasters do not deserve to live. We are obligated to save the unjustifiably oppressed.
