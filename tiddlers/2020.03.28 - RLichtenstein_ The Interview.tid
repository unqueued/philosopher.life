You experienced failure with revolutionary party politics, being particularly concerned with a revolutionary party increasingly pushing Engels' ideas and behaving "in a most uncharacteristic and aggressive manner, especially toward less committed comrades." 

You appear uncharacteristically aggressive toward those who disagree with you here (despite excellent reasoning). Sometimes that's what a philosopher ought to do. I'm obligated to point out that this goes both ways, but I know you know this.

<<<
These activists now declared that ‘dialectical’ thinking meant there were no ‘fixed or rigid principles’ in revolutionary politics. Everything it seemed had now to be bent toward the ‘concrete’ practical exigencies of the class struggle. Abstract ideas were ruled-out of court — except, of course, for that abstract idea. Only the concrete mattered, even if no one could say what that was without using yet more abstractions.
<<<

Is it fair to say you are absolutely opposed to having no 'fixed or rigid principles'? Why should we agree to such a thing? I do, but "why" matters. 

I agree to that claim thoroughly. I believe in the principle of sufficient reason (itself a metaphysical object) pointing us to metaphysics. I take the truthbearers of abstractions to be real, extant ideas that obtain outside of physics. I'm a Platonist. I don't consider Hegel's enterprise [[hope]]less at all. You strike me as brilliantly practical, and so this might seem irrelevant to you.

You say that to stay in the group, members had to:

<<<
conform to a suicidally increased rate of activity geared around the fight against the Poll Tax, whether or not they or their families suffered as a consequence.
<<<

The poll tax might not be worth suffering for, let alone dying for. You would agree that some things are worth immense suffering, profound risk, and death, right? How do you draw those lines? What makes those the right ones? I'm fine with having a problem with a group of people who unjustifiably cause others to suffer (delusionally or otherwise), but clearly there are cases in which suffering and causing others to suffer can be justified. Your own work is a clear demonstration of that assumption too.

You go one to speak of injustice in some outgrouping: 

<<<
...comrades were subjected to a series of grossly unfair public hectoring sessions (in a small way reminiscent of the sort of things that went on in the Chinese Cultural Revolution — minus the physical violence). These were conducted with no little vehemence by several party ‘attack dogs’ until the ‘victims’ either buckled under the strain, or gave up and left the party.
<<<

You hector people in public (online) pretty often. I don't mean you simply disagree with people often. I think you are unfair in some of these exchanges, but I don't know if it is grossly unfair. At least at first glance, I'm okay with the fact that you are like your own attack dog for your position. I appreciate your vehemence and raw commitment.

You appear to blame DM for disintegration and losses of revolutionary parties: 

<<<
I do not think that the local party has recovered from this period of “applied dialectics” (from what I can tell, it’s about a half to a third of its former size, and thus nowhere near as effective)...I have discovered since that this sort of thing is endemic in all forms of Dialectical Marxism, and has been for many generations.This series of events set off a train of thought. As is apparent to anyone with unblinkered eyes, so I thought, Dialectical Marxism is one the most unsuccessful major political movements in human history. Given its bold aims, its totalising theory and the fact that it is supposed to represent the aspirations of the vast bulk of humanity, the opposite should in fact be the case. But it isn’t. The record of Trotskyism is, if anything, even worse; in fact, it’s disgraceful. And I say that as a Trotskyist!
<<<

* Unsuccessful at what? You agree it is impactful (and therefore successful at something).
* Do you believe you are or aren't providing a totalizing theory? What do you mean by that?
* Fascinating to see "the record" used as, at least rhetorically, as evidence against the value of DM (your opposition) and Trotskyism (your own position).
