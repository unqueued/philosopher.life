title: 2017.09.26 - Pipefitting Log

The boys (Nash, JR, and Matt) arrived. It was good to see them.

They decided to offer NCCER training to us. I want to study for that initial test, so maybe I can hit journeyman cert plus quickly.

We organized our area. We cleaned up and stacked dunnage for the jobsite.

I was in charge of repulling a measurement we did yesterday. My measurement was spot on what the spool was. This is good since we thought we were off a few inches.

!! Break!

We fitup a pipe and did some rigging. 

I cleaned that saddle and taped it up.

Tightened bolts. 

!! Lunch!

I replaced a screwpipe valve someone broke. 

I cut and finished a piece with an eye hole for rigging that we will attach to the flange on the saddle for the 42" riser.

I started cutting plate for the portapowers for the trunion.


!! Break!

I told Chris-M about my desire to take the NCCER exam and he told me I wasn't going to pass. Ouch. Several others encouraged me to though. Chris-M said I should pursue it, even though I wouldn't be able to pass now.

David Mull, at the end of the day, thanked a bunch of people for what they did. When it came my turn he was like "I don't know what the f*** you did, but thank you." Uh...ouch. Lol.
