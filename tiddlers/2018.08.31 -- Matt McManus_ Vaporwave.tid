Thats a pretty cool way to introduce yourself.

My self description is as a critical theorist who embraces a broadly left liberal/democrat outlook on politics, while being pretty close to Whitehead/ Schelling ontologically, and an epistemological pragmatist. Not sure if that makes any sense but then, given my influences, may it is better that it doesn't all fit together. I teach these subjects at the university, which of course doesn't mean I know how to deal with them on my own time.

Why the wiki by the way, and the kind of retro 80s style. It reminds me a bit of vaporwave.
