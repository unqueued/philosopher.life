title: 2019.07.13 - Prompted Introspection: Biggest Risk

!! What is the biggest risk you have ever taken?

My life as a whole. The construction of my [[4DID]] is an entangled tree of narratives and projects, and they are agglomerated into this risk of not living a life with as much merit as I could muster given what I had. What should I do with the freedom I have? It is so easy to go astray. I have made mistake after mistake, and, of course, it would be a mistake to give up too soon. Those choices which spend my resources the most, particularly my time, tend to be some of the largest risks.
