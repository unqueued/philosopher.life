To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing today as an applicant for the Circulation Staff position. As you will find in my resume, I am committed to learning and to helping others acquire access to information; it is my vocation.

Books and technology have always been passions of mine. I want to share my love for information with others in whatever ways possible. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, fix computers, serve patrons, shelve books, write reports, or whatever we need to accomplish that day.

I hold libraries in high esteem because they serve the needs of their communities. Libraries are valuable community centers, and they provide crucial democratizing information access to people from all walks of life. It would be my pleasure to serve the people in the Johnson City area.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
