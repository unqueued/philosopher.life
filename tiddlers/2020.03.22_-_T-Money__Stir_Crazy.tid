How's your weekend been?
Mar 22 7:44pm
Been a very lazy weekend. Got all my stuff moved out of the Berea apartment. Otherwise. Streaming shows online and the internet on my phone. Very little drive to do much of anything. How about you guys?
Mar 22 8:03pm
Fuck yeah, dude.
Mar 22 8:06pm
I'm glad you got moved out and had a lazy weekend.
Mar 22 8:06pm
Sounds like it's been a while since you could just chill.
Mar 22 8:06pm
It was alright. Little bit stir crazy. We usually eat out most meals on the weekend. And I usually get my breakfast and coffee from a local shop. Often times go shopping or do something.
Mar 22 8:08pm
It was so lazy I kinda felt guilt, lmao.
Mar 22 8:08pm
Everyone doing alright in your family?

I am still recovering from years of kratom use and it has show how much it zapped my energy level. It's crazy.

Everyone is well Samantha still has a small cough. She had it weeks ago. She is upset I don't want her doing play dates.
