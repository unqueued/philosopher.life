title: 2020.03.07 - Prompted Introspection: Being Useful to Others

!! Name three people whose lives have been improved by knowing you, and explain why.

I can see that at least some of the lives I have improved were not the result of pleasant processes: [[2018.05.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: 3 People Better Off]]. I suspect that is more common for me than most. 

It's not clear what is meant by improved here. I presume in some overall sense, especially since one can improve in one area over here, but be destructive in that area over there. Two steps forward and one step back also applies.

My brothers' lives have improved because they know me. We've had a lot of thinking to do together. Escaping the [[cult]], finding ourselves, integrating into society, and rebuilding our lives has been a torturous process. Let me also say, my brothers have improved my life because I know them.

I'd like to think 6CM/7CM from [[Afterschool Teaching]] has a higher chance of surviving and thriving. I don't think any of the adults in her life connected with her pain nor could reason about it with her. I'm grateful to have the chance to be useful to her.
