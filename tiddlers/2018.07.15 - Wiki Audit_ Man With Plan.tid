title: 2018.07.15 - Wiki Audit: Man With Plan

I can see I need to overhaul the wiki. I need to go back through the past two years and putting things where they belong. I should try to put stuff where it belongs, but I can also transclude when I have no solid options. 

Remember, this is about maximizing your long-term memory and the efficiency of your self-representation to yourself.

Some of my directories need major fucking work. The [[Axioms of h0p3]] sit in shambles at this point. [[Find The Others]] is sited constantly, and it is a true piece of shit.
