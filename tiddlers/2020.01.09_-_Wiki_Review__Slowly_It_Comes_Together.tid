title: 2020.01.09 - Wiki Review: Slowly It Comes Together

* [[2020.01.08 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Game]]
** Edited. This is a question for my son too. The boy is strongly worried about the concept of a game. Me too. No idea how to solve it well.
* [[2020.01.08 - Wiki Review: Real Sleep Will Come]]
** I haven't found my modem among the boxes yet. 
*** I also need to find my wife's planner.
* [[2020.01.08 - TDL: Pod(s)]]
** It comes together slowly. I kind of can't put together a living room without something to sit on. That needs to be solved.
*** We need our cohesive nightly family time.

** Completed. That dude felt like a killer. I don't mean in the sense that he would kill because it is required by [[The Moral Law]]; I mean: he would take undue pleasure in it, and it has nothing to do with recognizing a value external to him.

** Edited. Though, I think we are often ridiculously childish in many ways as well. It's not easy to find a way to teach anyone (including myself) to develop themselves in relation to an accurate description of the world and a justified prescription of what it should be.
