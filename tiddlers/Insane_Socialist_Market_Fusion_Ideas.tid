title: Insane Socialist Market Fusion Ideas

//Capitalism's last ditch efforts! This place may be a box of contradictions. I respect the Redpilled Economist's opinion enough that I want to know it, even when I disagree with them profoundly. This is [[/b/]]attitudinal. Socialism and Capitalism are in a dialectic, and I must conceptually be open to the possibility of a sublator; I'd lack intellectual integrity not to.//

!! DOES THIS RULE PROMOTE [[T42T]]?

* Common land ownership with self-assessed tax (and bidding)
* Bi-cameral voting base: ranged voting (senate) + quadratic voting (representatives).
** Maybe quadratic ranged voting? That seems to maximize the preference we transmit.
** Maybe mandatory ranged voting first round (narrowing wide field of candidates down to 2), and quadratic voting second round (since it has the game theoretic proof).
*** Perhaps it can be mandatory 1 vote in quadratic voting, but your preference beyond is voluntary payment.
