Dear jbaty,

I'm sorry I've taken forever to respond.<<ref "a">> Life has been insanely busy (what's new, eh?). I have been reading your site, but I've not had the time and willpower to respond. I think you and I are similar in how we dive headfirst into hobbies and projects. It's been wonderful to see explosions on your wiki. 

I [[hope]] I'm not being rude, but it seems like you are still on the hunt for the one tool to rule them all. You appear to sprawl and experiment, and I like that. I've been thinking about [[spacemacs|http://spacemacs.org]] recently. Tell me to stay away from it and Doom, please. =) I don't have much confidence that I would be successful with such a tool, but I may try anyway. Your courage is inspirational.

Also, i3-Manjaro is the fucking bomb! Geek out with me, homie. Why have you gone that direction? I can't say I'm a good user of it, but I could not imagine life without something like it. In case it would be useful to our discussion, here's my: [[.i3/config]]. I sometimes have to use my wife's KDE, and I feel like I'm on an alien machine. The muscle memory addiction is too strong.

I thanked h0p3 for inspiring me to create this site with his prolific and wildly-fluctuating philosopher.life wiki. Shortly thereafter he (?) sent this link and it kind of blew my mind.
<<<

It's a pleasure to be conversing with you. I agree that the wiki is a wildly-fluctuating ride. I had no idea what I was getting myself into (and I probably still don't). I'm still thinking about what you are doing in yours.<<ref "i">>

<<<
How is a conversation via wiki supposed to work?
<<<

I'm not sure what we're doing here exactly (though I have thought about it plenty). You just have to jump into it; it can't be fully explained. I fear any explanation I give you won't be enough, but I will be happy to explain whatever I can. I think reading [[Sphygmus]] and her site will give you a strong indication of how the practice between two Tiddlywikis might go.

To be clear, I'm not convinced you must use a wiki.<<ref "r">> I think the wiki is immensely flexible while giving you just enough of a box to restrict yourself for quick construction. The wiki eliminates friction in a way that I haven't found in any other toolset so far. As far as [[hyperconversation]]s go, I think you have to map and talk to yourself and [[others]]. It keeps evolving and sometimes accelerates. I still feel like a noob on this learning curve, so I beg you to take what I say with a grain of salt. I've never done anything like this before.

I'm not sure what you are looking for in a relationship or conversation. That might be an important thing to think about here. What do you hope to accomplish?

These are the primary goals I have in our conversations: [[Public Self-Modelers]] + [[Find The Others]]

<<<
 Do we create "tiddlers" and then email links to each other? I suppose I'll start there. I'll also take h0p3's lead and create people pages with links to threads, etc.
<<<

You can e-mail if you'd like (that's how it often starts out for me). Now that we've established contact, we can also just leave tiddlers for each other and check at our leisure. You might think about {[[Connect]]} as well.

You'll note that I will be copy and pasting your tiddlers into my wiki to preserve the context for myself. This could be automated (I've seen a couple twederation options). I don't mind doing it by hand so far. If you are interested, you can send me the information for your own [[Personal Stylesheets]] (it affects how letters from you look on my site).

I should warn you: sometimes I have a tendency to be verbose and rapidfire. That may not be what you're looking for here, and so I appreciate whatever signals you can give me for what you do want. This is probably the kind of thing that we learn how to do with each other. Everyone seems to have a way that suits them best.<<ref "b">>

<<<
I'm new here. Thanks again to my new friend!
<<<

Aye. It's good to meet you!

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
