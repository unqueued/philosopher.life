title: 2017.06.04 -- Cry Log

My wife was talking about seeing an old house of hers. It was run down and falling apart. It was a tough moment for her. We've all been there. I empathized with her, and we talked about it. We talked about what we wanted, our dreams and hopes. I'm glad we spend that time together with each other on Sundays. I may not be able to "get it up" on Sundays after DCK, but I can lay down naked, vulnerable, and empathic with my one true love.
