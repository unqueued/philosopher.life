title: 2018.08.19 -- JRE: Chuck E Cheese

We chatted over XMPP (he acquired Signal today) over the course of the day. Antidepressants are working for him! Woot! 

We've had some trouble staying in touch (a trend I've noticed). I need to call after 8pm, although 3:30pm for short conversations works too. 

He did the visitation with Raylan today at Chuck E Cheese (not his selection). Sounds like it's an existential grind.
