title: 2018.04.07 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Trips

!! If you could go back and relive one of your past trips, whom from your current entourage would you take with you?

My favorite trips have been drug-induced or philosophical. I try to tell them the philosophical stories. As for the drug-induced, I'd love for my family to experience it without any risk. That's not really possible. I've talked with my offspring in particular about substance use. We've talked about research, harm reduction practices, and the reasons I don't favor their using drugs until after their frontal lobes have developed. I have told them I will gladly help them experience these substances safely though, and I'm excited to eventually have that opportunity with them.
