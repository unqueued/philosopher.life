!! Audit:

* I don't accomplish much here. This log has taken a huge hit this month.
* My prompted introspections do tell a story though. Damn, I was feeling pretty depressed this month.
* Lots of real stuff going on. I didn't flesh it out much.
* Redpilled.
* Lots of parenting considerations
* I wrote more after DCK
* Okay, I've convinced myself: I'm still really proud of the work I did here. Maybe it wasn't academically beautiful, but it was very useful to me.
* [[/b/]] looks like serious competition, or perhaps it is a seed.
