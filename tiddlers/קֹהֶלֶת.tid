title: קֹהֶלֶת

I hear your cry, gatherer. From a cosmic vantage-point, it does seem as though all is meaningless vanity. Like all wise stoics, you are skilled at lying to yourself. At times, you appear to contradict yourself beautifully, and I suspect you know it. You do not resolve the problem with your sleight of hand. 

Let us assume your farce of an argument is no accident. What is the best explanation for your unjustified prescription? Forgive my Redpilled Straussian interpretation, but I think you ask us to not curse the king, even in our thoughts, because it politically benefits you. You are truly wise for an egoist, son of David, since even your words chase yourself in the wind.
