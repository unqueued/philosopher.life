!! What is a place that inspires you?

Awwwww, I answer this one warmly: [[2018.03.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: Geographical Inspiration]]. What was I smokin'?

I feel inspired in other contexts too. I live on a mountain top, and gazing at the other smoky mountain tops causes me to think, speak, and eventually even act. There were cows grazing on one mountaintop, mansions in the distance, a highway, cell towers, and the mountain I point to when speaking of Dasein and quantum observation. Nature is often inspirational. Sometimes, it's a solid drug for me.
