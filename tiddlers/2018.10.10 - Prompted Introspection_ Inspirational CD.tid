title: 2018.10.10 - Prompted Introspection: Inspirational CD

!! If you need inspiration and put on your favorite CD, which one is it? What is your favorite song on this CD? Why do these lyrics "speak" to you? If you met the artist, what would you ask him? If you could be in the front row, where would you see him/her in concert?

Do I have to own the CD right now? I've looked through my junk, and I have one CD left, I believe: Fingerstyle Blues, a CD that came with a guitar sheetmusic book.<<ref "g">> I'm a beginner guitarist (perhaps I should hesitate to call myself one), and I've not played in a couple years, but I could pick up the basics again; these songs are meant for beginners, but they sound good. I actually prefer my banjo to the guitar, since it is more rewarding for the fingerstyle I prefer,<<ref "c">> at least to my ears. This reminds me, I need to sell/give-away my piano/altar/prison.  

I'm not sure what my favorite song from the CD is, but I think [[Slow As Lightnin'|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VWfCaHoN08]] has a nice feel to it.

I don't sing unless forced or screwing around (though, I enjoy singing after pushing bricks or non-sensical autistic noise making). I used to play music, but I don't anymore. I listen to music and I'll dance each day. I fear it is a waste of my talent and time to play music. Opportunity costs, Samwise: you know how it do. Historically, it has been a giant fucking waste of my life for what I got. You know my thoughts on [[Music]] though.

Except insofar as I'm morally obligated, I don't care what the artist thinks. Not all art is equal to me; I'm trying to be successfully telic here. I'd be more interested in the man than the musician. I'm gonna bet he would find me tiresome or infuriating very quickly if I was being myself with him. If I knew how to connect, I would.

Wait...Lady Melisandre, maybe you asked this question. The "where" is a free transporter beam into any geographical context, right? That would require some devious plotting, ofc. How does one use that power to ethically maximize [[The Good]]? I do not know.
