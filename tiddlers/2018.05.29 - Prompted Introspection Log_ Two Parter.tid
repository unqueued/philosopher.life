!! What does "holds water? mean to you?What is your first memory?

Lol. Well, I didn't make the list. These questions are not related to each other, I think. Or, rather, this is unintentional.

As a philosopher, I'm obviously deeply invested in the soundness of my arguments. Holding water through structural validity, Bayesian predictive externalism, and whatever internalist coherentisms beyond are crucial to being a good philosopher. I hope to be justified in my beliefs, desires, and actions. I want to objectively justify my existence to myself. There is an odd circularity to it, a set of paradoxes I have not (and perhaps cannot, mystically) explain to myself.

I can't remember my first memory. HA! I probably can't even remember my first memory that I used to remember, etc. To be honest, I have strong doubts about my childhood memories; I think they are corrupted semblances, born of a perceptual framework which was naive and too ignorant to grasp the more obvious truths of what I was seeing. I think even attending to the percepts is confabulated, inaccurate, and thoroughly biased. Essentially, I was a different person. Remembering the memories of a different me is somehow paradoxical. Does this answer hold water for you?
