!! Audit:

* This log has some of the most expressive title.Titles of any log. I remember what happened often just from a couple words.
* I'm continually wrestling with my machines to get them to do what I want. It's part of my pleasure, but it can also be a pain in my ass. I'm really hoping that my family begins to see the value in it as well.
* Love the "Bye" mentality
* I'm glad I've moved to YOLO updates.
* I'm glad to move back to Ubuntu/Debian for servers, although HTPC is still doing fine on Manjaro. It's kind of a hybrid though.
* Usual upkeep, I think. I'm glad to have had the opportunity. I like admin'ing my network with my daughter too.
