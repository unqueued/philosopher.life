title: 2019.04.03 - Charlie: Lonely

Charlie explained how his brother doesn't talk to him. Charlie is always helping his brother out with the ancient languages and contexts in the Bible, and the Pentecostal preacher doesn't want to hear it. Few men I know stand toe-to-toe with me on these grounds, and Charlie is fierce (in a quixotically neutral manner) and highly learned (to the point of backbreaking specialty). He comes out of left field all the time; I can't keep up with even his dumbed-down explanations of physics. =/ [[R]] talks about the weather, says "hi," and keeps it brief, almost into smalltalk. Missy is anti-Christian, and that seems to be their main talking point (they are usually quiet around each other when I see them). He called me a mathematician without formal training (much higher praise than I deserve). I'm the only one who talks to him about substance. 

We talked about autism and I tried to reason with him about what he is experiencing. He knows what it's like to be alien. God damn, it's painful talking to him about it. The man can talk about almost anything and link it to something pretty amazing. 

He needs a job to survive. He's having a hard time finding a w2-based employment which will hire an old man. It fucking sucks to see this genius who is isolated from everyone. He's a scholar. Nobody gives a shit about what he thinks, and nobody is going to put up with his quirks.

He's used to computers from the 70's and 80's, and he can't jump into the new world. The world is incommensurable to him.
