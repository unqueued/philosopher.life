How was your day?
THU 7:55 PM
Hey [[h0p3]]. It was aight. Missed a chance to talk to my boss about looking for another job and now I’m beating myself up about it.
THU 7:57 PM
Ya know, the usual.
THU 7:57 PM
Shit happens.
THU 7:58 PM
On the bright side though, the situation with Austin seems to be looking up a bit more — their dad was able to get a car for him so he can drive himself to his new job.
THU 7:58 PM
Which should temporarily solve the problem, assuming the car holds up.
THU 7:59 PM
Awesome!
THU 8:00 PM
How are you holding up?
THU 8:00 PM
Grinding away at the wiki.
THU 8:00 PM
Hopefully start the job soon enough. Don't know when all the paperwork goes through.
THU 8:01 PM
Looks like a lot of nepotism in the governmental institutions.
THU 8:01 PM
Met a fellow who sold his company to FB (headed up VR for them as well). He's interested in hyperliterature, so I'm talking to him about my wiki. Not sure if it will go anywhere.
THU 8:02 PM
I very much want [[k0sh3k]] to get the job in Costa Rica.
THU 8:02 PM
Family is doing well enough.
THU 8:02 PM
Wait, job in Costa Rica? I must have missed that somewheres
THU 8:09 PM
She turned the job down in Bhutan too.
THU 8:10 PM
Okay yeah, I’ve missed a lot. Geez... I have some catching up to do.
THU 8:10 PM
Cause I have no idea what you’re talking about. But that’s okay, I can read about it
THU 8:11 PM
Also raiding, so my responses will be intermittent
THU 8:11 PM
Noice.
THU 8:11 PM
What you raiding on?
THU 8:12 PM
FFXIV
THU 8:12 PM
Ah. Cool beans.
THU 8:12 PM
[[K]] and I run a guild \o/
THU 8:12 PM
Thursday’s are raid night.
THU 8:12 PM
Yes. I'm surprised I haven't heard more about it in a while.
THU 8:12 PM
It’s been suuuuper slow lately
THU 8:12 PM
It doesn't sound like a game that requires too much investment though, which is cool.
THU 8:13 PM
Very true
THU 8:19 PM
I think it’s the only reason we’ve stuck with it so long
THU 8:21 PM
But it does mean it gets slow at times...
THU 8:21 PM
Games that you can walk away from are nice.
THU 8:22 PM
Skinnerboxes that aren't too addictive are the ones I aim for now.
THU 8:22 PM
Skinnerboxes... I feel like I should know what those are
THU 8:23 PM

THU 8:24 PM
Ooh yeeeaaaaah
THU 8:28 PM
I follow now. Sorry. Kinda slow today. XD
