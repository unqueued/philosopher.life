title: 2018.03.21 - D2 Log

Necromancer has died twice to those fucking stabbing midgets. They one-shot me, they are blazing fast, and I can't see them very well as a colorblind man. That said, the necro still clears through better than everyone else. Perhaps I should get him to 92, grind for items on the way, and then gamble/craft amulets (finally) for +2 skill ammies that I like.
