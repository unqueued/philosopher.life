title: 2019.09.22 - Prompted Introspection: Grotesque Fool

!! What?s your motto? How would you like to be remembered?

Why should we think those two questions belong together? I think you've possibly got a non sequitur here; there are plenty of cases in which they should be strongly peeled apart.

My motto: "do your best [[irwartfrr]]." N^^ailed^^ it.

I would like to be remembered for having done my best with what I've had to do what was [[right]], for sheathing my tiny sword with gusto, and for being the grotesque fool I really am. I'd trade being remembered for a more just world all day erryday. Hell, I primarily try to remember who I am because it's my duty to honestly, transparently, wisely, recursively, and coherently tell myself the stories of who I am.

Oh, are we {[[Dream]]}ing here? Sorry, Samwise, I'm not so lucid today. Alright, fine, `/sprankle-magic-transhumanist-dust`. I hope for my wiki to eventually, one day, be MLed in such a way that it can represent me in decision procedures necessary for building the [[TPK]]. This is only for [[power]], right?<<ref "h">> Lol. I think my point of view should be heard, and I think I have a moral right to vote. I want my model to be remembered and interacted with only insofar as it is useful to [[Humanity]]. It would be cool to be a quintessential example of ~~a shitshow~~ what participating online as ourselves ought to be like (though I make no claim to succeeding).<<ref "r">> Guis, we got a badass over here.

Who the fuck reads these days? Weirdos. Aint nobody got time fo dat in the future.
