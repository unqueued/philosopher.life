title: 2019.02.21 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Taking A Hint

//Lost the original. `/sigh`//

!! Respond to the following gem:

//Taking a hint// is fundamentally different from deciphering a formal communication or solving a mathematical problem; it involves discovering a message that has been planted within a context by someone who thinks he shares with the recipient certain impressions or associations. One cannot, without empirical evidence, deduce what understandings can be perceived in a nonzero-sum game of maneuver any more than one can prove, by purely formal deduction, that a particular joke is bound to be funny.

-- Thomas Schelling (pp. 163â€“164 in //The Strategy of Conflict//, Harvard University Press, 1960)

I'll agree esoteric writing is difficult to interpret. Anything which cannot be computed which we might understand is qualia. The hint which points to that which cannot be fully articulated is a method for arriving at qualia. The method is computable, describable, and deducibly decodable, even if the end result might not be. All of that said: it's obvious to me the vast majority of hints, implicatures, insinuations, rhetorical devices, and so on, can be symbolized and formally understood in as much as any language can. Even humor can be calculated; it is a techne.

If I'm being [[Straussian]]ly charitable here, I could interpret this as pointing to a gnostic method to gnostic methods. I doubt it, but perhaps I'm ill-informed. Just look at those symbols.
