* Stunning!

*** LOL! I'm literally stunned, and I'm going to tell her too.

*** I missed knowing Michael Madary. What becomes of this wiki, obviously, is related to this issue.

*** Only getting worse.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3216950
*** Fascinating. This is not what I expected for them.
** https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/09/05/contract-upgrade-anti-patterns/
*** I continue to lose all hope in Eth. It's a damned good idea in a lot of ways. There is something right about, but I don't think Eth is going to succeed.
** https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2018/07/10-physics-facts-you-should-have.html

*** Gotta say, I wonder if my vitamins are just this. I have stopped taking them to see...Things are getting worse though...so, maybe that's a bad idea, placebo or not.
** https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+55aFy+Hv9O5citAawS+mVZO+ywCKd9NQ2wxUmGsz9ZJzqgJQ@mail.gmail.com/
*** Would never have guessed he'd do that.
** https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/about-40-economics-experiments-fail-replication-survey
*** This one thing I held Economics in higher regard than Psychology...Most of the economists I've met were just better at math and statistics. Interesting to see this, and that's as someone who thinks economists tend to be very shitty modelers who don't own up to it.

* Think About It
** https://medium.com/@exiledconsensus/politics-hypocrisy-and-the-english-language-7c6616b24eb1
*** I very much like this article. It's a fine starting place. I think it hasn't paid nearly enough attention to the philosophical underpinnings here though (despite paying some lip service). 
** https://politicalanimalmagazine.com/responding-to-morally-flawed-historical-philosophers-and-philosophies/
*** You can't be Straussianly charitable without looking at historical context. Go ahead and talk shit: you should. I have a tendency to think that most philosophy should actually be crystallized into very terse argumentation though. There are some systematic philosophers that we can't engage like that. 
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17953578
*** /smh, well, I'm glad to have the comments. Jesus. I am boned.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17955783
*** Sadly, I strongly doubt there are any moral versions of this job available. Sounds like fun to me though.
** https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-innocence-of-becoming-nietzsche-against-guilt/
*** Sounds like the game is over. I've never been able to connect with Nietzsche, despite many stellar aphorisms. 

* Fishy
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/t-magazine/eating-bugs-food-restaurant.html
*** I have no problem eating insects. I've done it many times before. Easy to find in Thai markets. NYT is making another move here folks. I can smell what the neoliberals are cooking, can you?
** https://www.zdnet.com/article/exploit-vendor-drops-tor-browser-zero-day-on-twitter/
*** Fascinating. Why was it dropped at all? That seems like it should be quite expensive.
** https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/09/13/edward-snowden-reconsidered/
*** I can agree to quite a bit of this. Unfortunately, I think this reconsideration has still missed the mark. Don't get me wrong, I think Snowden can be wrong. This is an odd attempt. 
** https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/09/15/america-is-pushing-the-labour-market-to-its-limits
*** Always interesting. Of course, I still think these numbers are lies.
