title: 2019.11.17 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Actual/Potential

!! Respond to the following gem:

Every civilisation that disavows its barbarian potential has already capitulated to barbarism.

Oh, come now, that is far too lenient. I'm not confident in civilization and barbarianism as the fitting concepts here either. I agree that most people do not even attempt to envision the extremes we're looking for well enough. I am regularly forced to argue with people about how far possibility and plausibility extend, but I think more is up to us than most would concede. Conveniently failing to uncover or even hiding this from ourselves is evil. Of course, we should just be thinking about potential here either, there's plenty already actualized to focus on (and, in fact, that is part of recognizing the meaning of that potential).
