title: 2010.10.19 - Demarcation of the Intentional

 It is my view that Okrent has provided an account of intentionality on a continuum. He has defined the sorts of variables and factors which we can use to construct a degree-based predication of intentional attributes. I really appreciate this approach, and I like how it helps us make sense of differences in the vast variety of species. As a differentiationist, I’m quite partial to saying that certain organisms have a different sort of (deeper, more rational, more complex) intentionality than others, e.g. the qualitative differences between human intentionality and the intentionality of ravens. Building his theory on a continuum has major strengths, but, unfortunately, I’m not sure if Okrent has adequately addressed a weakness to the continuum. The question we must ask is: at what point on the continuum of intentionality are we going to demarcate the intentional (in the least degree) from the non-intentional (remaining so very close to being intentional)?

I don’t know exactly where does Okrent draws the line of novelty, flexibility, and rich adaptiveness that demarcates the intentional from the unintentional. Surely this is vital to the alien field teleologist. Strictly defining the degree to which a thing must be novel, flexible, and adaptive would be a necessary part of the field teleologist’s objective rubric of intentionality. For now, I feel Okrent has given somewhat arbitrary lines.

The sphex wasp lacks some fundamental aspects of instrumental rationality and essentially intentionality, but the plover doesn’t. Somewhere in the middle is a frog which has some degree of “susceptibility to trickery.”<<ref "1">> I think he brings us closer and closer to where he wishes to demarcate the intentional from the unintentional, but I really do want to know where on the continuum he draws the line and, especially, why.

Other questions I wonder about: Would not even the most objective and knowledgeable field teleologist perhaps make some mistakes about what things are intentional and what aren’t? Would a small baby (which I’ll stick my neck out and say I’m in favor of the notion that infant humans have intentionality and concept formation) be testable by the field teleologist? Would the small baby meet the requirements for instrumental rational action as set out by the field teleologist? What about a human with some uncommon mental ‘ticks’, such as one who might be OCD, etc.? In the moment where the compulsive liar is lying, and they aren’t providing novel action, and it doesn’t appear that they have novel proximate ends, and it doesn’t appear as if they aren’t very flexible and adaptive, are we really going to say they lack intentionality or concepts either at all or with regard to this specific moment?
