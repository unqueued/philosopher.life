** Pump up your weaknesses. Make yourself resilient, and at least hit the minimum requirements.

** Oh, this was it! 
** Studying cards rigorously is very beautiful. Lots of cool things come out of it.
*[[Notage Ti.3]]
** fascinating to see [[/b/]] there. 
** I beg you for paragraph breaks, please.
*[[Solitaire encryption & decryption]]
** I'm glad you enjoyed it. This was fun.

** He doesn't talk about accountability, does he? One does not have to interpret that out of these literal words. It is a crucial piece to the puzzle though. There is a difference between having the [[power]] to decide where to go and using that [[power]] wisely, including choosing the right direction.
** I think you are doing a fine job interpreting him (I would adore knowing how he would respond to you) I think it's hard to map ourselves onto this well enough. This is also a crazy hard problem in philosophy.
** We are all hypocrites (even when we say we are all hypocrites). I am obviously addicted to pleasure as well. It's not so easy to do the right thing when it costs so much. This is where justice must obtain. We cannot always trust our feelings, unfortunately.
*[[2020.02.27 – Carpe Diem: 7:00]]
** You can be more specific.
*** What bedtime?
*** What did you eat?
*** What book? What part of the book? 
*** What conversations did you have?
*** What things in the day stood out to you otherwise, including little things?
*[[2020.02.27 – h0p3ful Review: Briefer]]
** How much input do you want from me? You have to help me shape this practice.
*[[2020.02.27 – Prompted Introspection: Hrm.]]
** Run-on sentences. Sorry. You come by it honestly. It will be worth becoming adept at just breaking them down (though, not all can be broken down without losing something).
** What makes you think space exploration will have anything to do with invasion? Surely, we can explore space, for example, without encountering any aliens.

** This might be dumb, but I try to leave a space after the colon (though I have exceptions). Should still be just fine for parsing, but it might make it easier in some cases if you follow the exact same convention.
** It's interesting that you leave uncommented links. Even that says something, and that might be worth highlighting. I don't know.
** That is a painful claim to wrestle with. It's not a simple one to make sense of at all.
** Mute people face many obstacles which are likely to decrease the quantity and quality of their lives. 
*** They can still communicate, but it might not be through a natural spoken language.
**** One of the reasons we practice our languages skills so much together is that I'm straight up scared for you (always have been) that you will be mute or functionally almost mute in many contexts. We no good at form words, son, must speak caveman too, all we can do sometime.
***** I am convinced writing is the core factor in improving your real-time verbal skills. Once we taught you to read, everything started coming alive. You didn't need your sister to interpret for you (no idea how she saw what she saw), and you're ability to sign enabled you to bond and construct with others far more effectively.  You will need to figure out whether or not I have been accurate in this assessment. Only you can see parts of this equation.
** Why should I buy that definition of shelter? Imagine living on a beautiful island with perfect permanent weather for flourishing without what is normally considered a shelter. How is the island, itself, not a kind of shelter?
** It is surprising to call yourself a toy. There's a way in which we must attempt to think outside ourselves, to even reduce ourselves to specks of dust in the wind of the universe; we fit into things, we can be useful for things, etc. 
*** Plus, who doesn't love to play with their genitals?
**** Do we need shelter from our embarrassment? 
***** Don't worry, you will build shelter from me that will be fantastic. I think that space is super important.
****** We are already building such things. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Twas* =) 
** Do you want to do some kind of outdoor sporting event with me? 
*** We barely get out of the house enough as it is. I enjoy it, and you enjoy it. This could be something we template, sharing a schedule together. 
** I never know if you should keep your old grammar mistakes (in your old work) or not. 
*** If I were you: I'd keep them there. See how far you've come.
**** You are definitely going to always have some messy places in your wiki (you are doing it wrong if there's not some).
** "I am a contextualist" - definitely worth thinking about what that means. It's okay if you feel like you aren't sometimes too. You should explore this.
