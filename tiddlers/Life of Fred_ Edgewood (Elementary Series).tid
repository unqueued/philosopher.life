title: Life of Fred: Edgewood (Elementary Series)

Strong emphasis on high school math previews. I love it. We get to see what future proofs look like. I'm very pleased. Overall, however, this book didn't seem to show much that was new.

I continue to find mistakes in these books. The wording is incorrect on some of these questions, and when we get to philosophical issues (which the author is wise to bring up), he is often not careful enough.

This is an excellent series.
