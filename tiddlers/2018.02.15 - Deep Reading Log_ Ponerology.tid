title: 2018.02.15 - Deep Reading Log: Ponerology

I aim to look at this with a skeptical eye. I'm fine with the book not being scientific in a sense; I'm willing to look at intuitions and poor arguments. I don't expect perfection. We'll see how it adds up though.

Some people clearly don't care for the book, and others are passionate about it. It's controversial.

//Hysteroidal cycles// sounds very similar to the oscillatory Marxist material dialectic. It does so bridging the memetic/idealogical gap that I feel Marx tends to ignore in some respects.

So far, a gloss over the literature surrounding this book suggests they many don't have a full grasp of clinical or philosophical concepts of psychopathy. That doesn't mean they are entirely wrong.

They also seem completely unable to appreciate egoism as the fundamental driving force of humanity. It's odd because I see the marks of social Darwinism in their work, but I don't think they realize that everyone is actually evil. That is a hard pill to swallow, and of course, it doesn't help them on their quest.

!! Editor's Preface 

The author uses plenty of hyperbole. She's not an academic, although she appears to be a scholar. She is a conspiracy theorist who has taken on another's work. 

My worry is that the author is scapegoating all of our sins into the hands of a few. I grant, evil comes in degrees. I think we are all responsible to some extent. I am happy to villify us all, but I think we be careful in how we villify the few at this level, which borders of eugenics. I will say, however, there are cases where the small minority really are to blame. Let us see how the author handles it. 

I find it very odd to talk about psychopaths lacking souls. I see us all on the dark triad spectrum, and I don't think we have souls at all. I suggest they are talking about people on the extreme end of the spectrum here. The "overton window" of psychopathy, a general trend towards that end of the spectrum, is what I'm interested in!

Absolute lack of empathy for others is also not the absolute lack of empathy (since one can empathize with oneself). Furthermore, why should I agree one is not being psychopathic if one is not absolutely that way? The spectrum problem is something they continually miss.

The problem of other minds skepticism and also of "The Other" is deeply rooted in this work. Defining Reason so clearly. I worry, however, that the [[CI]] does a different kind of work than they think.

Well-integrated psychopaths clearly empathize with themselves. Psychopaths can choose to empathize and turn it off at convenient moments. What makes them effective at picking out the rules of human socialization is in fact largely empathic. You might claim it is mere functional but not actual, but I think you will be unable to show the difference as cleanly as you hope (and will always have the de se de re problem).

I appreciate the look at the phenomology and moral anti-realism overlay grid perception of psychopathy. There is something right about that.

Yes, the psychopath is a predator. Can we give good reasons for why they ought not be that way, especially if they have no choice in it? Are we really going to be able to differentiate ourselves as much as we'd like to? I think there are profound philosophical problems here that the author's have swept under the rug.

Psychopaths can have friends. They aren't standard friendships, but they do have friends that matter to them. A psychopath can love her cat, truly, and simply not love others. Psychopathy is a matter of degrees and contexts.

I doubt the secrecy, but I will admit: this is a dangerous notion to those in power who are psychopathic (which, I suggest, is likely most of them to significant degrees).

!! Author's Foreword

The "lost manuscripts" is paranoic and very hard to believe. I proceed with caution. Lots of redflags in here.

!! Preface to the Red Pill Press Edition

Sounds religious, cultic, etc.

//Ignota nulla curatio morbi//: "do not attempt to cure what you do not understand"

Secret agents. The author might be insane (although, I have no proof). I will still listen to words of madmen and peel apart the wheat from the chaff. This reads like bad fiction. But, parts of it do have the ring of truth. Ugh. 

Personality Disintegration, that I am convinced by. There is something correct about it dialectically. I had to look it up: the author obviously worked with Dabrowski. That is a line of credit I must cede to him.

The library scene is paranoid. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but cmon! Ugh. Look, if I were trying to be an evil mastermind, I'd definitely attempt to protect myself. Maybe this is a simple attempt at it, but I think there are even more effective methods.

It has a serious witch-hunt element to it.

Transpersonification sounds magical. Of course, this book seems too old to have access to the neuroscience and computational theories of mind that we have (not that we have much, but we seem to have more signal-to-noise ratio than these guys in some quantitative respects).

He is correct about the nature of social science disciplines in terms of relativity and failing to be careful in their moral analysis. His attributions for these reasons may not be entirely correct (but at least partially correct). I think Economics and Business programs are the most likely to demonstrate, but I have seen it elsewhere.

<<<
Thus, we shall be able to accept the truth of the nature of evil without reflex protests on the part of our natural egotism.
<<<

Nm, you got it. That was exactly what you needed to say.

I'm very curious to see the prescriptions of this book. What methods for survival and curing can they offer? Why the ominous repetition of the caution against curing without understanding?

!! CHAPTER II - SOME INDISPENSABLE CONCEPTS

Interesting history review. It has some explanatory powers, although I suggest no human society would escape the vortex he is pointing to.

The claims of censorship are at least partially believable.

When you say "beyond the scope of natural language," I'm afraid you don't know what that means and/or you are lying.

I love that word nescience. Also, this passage sounds like a description of being redpilled. You have my attention, sir.

A lot of my concerns are at least partially answered in this chapter. I will be more relaxed. These people are not fools (although, that doesn't make them correct). I am extremely hesitant about the metaphysical claims, but that is only because I have doubts they share my view. Taken explicitly, I cannot disagree; it just has the hallmarks of redflag.world.

I think people would call this psychobabble and mumbo-jumbo. I'm not there yet. I have a very high tolerance, however, for cryptic, technical, philosophical, and spiritual language mixtures that few possess. 

They worship of normalcy is also problematic. The author, however, has provided non-trivial caveats.

It is definitely folk-psych. However, that is not a good enough reason to dismiss (although, it may be a good enough reason to doubt and very carefully think about it). 

I am pleased that they reduce social interactions to their atoms. Macroscopic work without micro is a very poor method indeed. Yet, I am also pleased with their attempt to sketch a notion of the macro. 

PRESCRIPTION: DECENTRALIZE POWER (pg. 80). 

Yes. You see it.

!! CHAPTER III - THE HYSTEROIDAL CYCLE

Not sure about the romanticism part, but damn, it does a great job of explaining a serious problem. Admittedly, I think this is a cycle that we see at many levels in the human Rhizome stack of stacks, at different intervals, for different reasons, etc. It's complex. But, I think this cycle has something going on.

Fairly anti-American, but I can't say I blame them. Several of the arguments make sense. When France sneezes, the rest of Europe catches the cold. It is obvious to 

!! CHAPTER IV - PONEROLOGY

Thinking of evil as a disease is classic. I worry they are going to hand-wave the problem of autonomy. I am weary of the "experience teaches us line."

Forgive my doubt about the research that you can't provide, except from memory. Do you have any more of them golden tablets?

Psychotherapy fails in many respects. I am not allergic to its possible validity.

I certainly have "paranoid characteropathy" features. Not sure about lesions (and, that probably isn't the most important part the story the author is telling either). Spellbind is a fun word, almost magical. Schizoidia also seems to fit me to some degree.

This person rejects Marx. That is fascinating. I don't think they actually appreciate what Marx is doing either. They agree on more than they realize.

<<<
They learn to recognize each other incrowd as early as childhood, and they develop an awareness of the existence of other individuals similar to them. 
<<<

A curious claim I have seen many people agree to. I feel like I'm becoming better at spotting the more overt kinds, but I also see it in everyone.

Ah, most of the claims really don't apply to me.

//Skirtoids//, lol. Love the name for it.

The psychopathic utopia discussion on 139 is lacking. I suggest that anyone with an understanding of the distinction between moral and legal while also living in a messed up world could easily demonstrate very similar characteristics. In a world of evil men, a good one will be so deviant that he will look like he is the evil one to the majority.
