!! Audit:

* I was obviously stressed. Lol.
** But, I appreciate that we spread it out over time. I was less likely to get sick. I have a suspicion that I'm sick right now, in part, because of the stress.
* Exercising paid off. I was not as sore as I could have been.
** I think I was just keeping muscle I had acquired before, but that's fine.
** I notice the largest difference in my son. He's learning how to exert himself more.
* I like how the maymay [[title.Title]]s stand out nicely in this list. =)
* Feels like a very stretched out move. =/
* My brother has had another difficult month. So much illness in his household, and the effects on their work schedules have been absurd.
* I'm so grateful for my wife's planning. She made it work.
* It's a shame that Levi never seemed to connect. He kept saying he would. I don't know. Maybe he will eventually? Depression is a bitch.
** Similar for Cavan. I have no idea why. He must be a busy dude.
* The pods were a source of sanity for us. I have no idea how we would have succeeded without them.
* Fuck, I'm going to miss people. =(.
* The month felt like a spiral, and the tail end I head down the rabbithole.
