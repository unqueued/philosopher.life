* Woke at 8
* Meditation
* Marching orders
* Fluids changed.
* Sat in Bojangles eating a biscuit.
** My hope for [[Humanity]] is dying listening to the boomers talk politics. That is some profound evil in these creatures.
* Workers came to change out fixtures. 
** Contractors from out of state. We talked for a while.
** I wish they let me do the breaker; turned off power to our machines. =/
* Fireman Time!
* A quiet demo of our home
** My offspring changed their minds, and our day was not hell. Smooth sailing and even play together.
* LoL Allstars
** Son seemed more interested. Lots of questions.
* Our walls are almost entirely bare now.
* [[m17]] VM almost complete
* Picked up my wife 
** Asked her to save some reserves in her gas tank. She's going harder than she has to.
* Walked with wife
* Called [[JRE]]
* Offspring and I made squash, zucchini, and tortellini.
* //Psych// 
* Food and alcohol
* Nap
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2:30?
