title: 2018.09.05 - Prompted Introspection: 5 Person Dinner

!! You have to invite 5 people to dinner, dead or alive. Who do you invite and why?

Lady Melisandre, you always put me in wonderful yet impossible positions. You are my {[[Dreams]]}whore. 

Are they guaranteed to come? How public would this thing be? Would these people know they were traveling in time? How would I situate them so as not to freak out? I actually don't understand how this works.

Part of the problem is that I can't speak the languages of most of the people I admire most in history. I'm illiterate. I also only want to choose people if I think it would help the future, which resurrections, even only for a meal, might be able to do, I don't know. 

Imagine (in no particular order) Kant, Aristotle, Hegel, Gödel, and von Neumann sitting in my house. My eyes watered at the thought (he gives moisture to the dead!). The dead could be used as an encounter-symbol to convert the living to be righteous people: a transfiguration and repentance. I do not know. This magic goes far.

What actually maximizes the chance that we solve the current Crisis of Capitalism? I do not know. That is how I would select these answers. Even if it meant that I didn't get to enjoy the meal or participate in the conversation whatsoever. This wish should not be spent on me.
