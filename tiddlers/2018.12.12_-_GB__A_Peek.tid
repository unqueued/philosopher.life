//It is difficult to describe what this conversation feels like to me. I fear he will hate my work. But, I also believe that if he knew how deep this rabbithole went, he would adore it (even if only from just how much work has gone into it).//

How's life going for you?
November 25 2018 9:54 AM
Meh
December 11 2018 2:11 AM
Lol
December 11 2018 2:11 AM
Lol. Yeah. I hear that.
December 11 2018 10:32 AM
Hey, you never sent me your chapter. I'm interested to see it.
December 11 2018 10:34 AM
Sorry, been really busy wrapping up the semester heading, writing, being depressed lol
Today at 10:42 PM
What are you up to?
Today at 10:43 PM
I've been mostly focusing on my second chapter but should be done with the second draft of the first soon. I'd much rather send you that one than the first one
Today at 10:43 PM
Depression is a beast. Even when I can keep the wolf off my back, I still see it staring out of the wood at me. I'm sorry. =(
Today at 10:46 PM
It sounds like you've been productive though, which is cool.
Today at 10:46 PM
Yeah dude it's no joke. Been hard especially after my breakup too.
Today at 10:46 PM
Meh not really. For me "writing" basically means adding to a pile of unorganized notes
Today at 10:47 PM
Ah, preach.
Today at 10:47 PM
That is how I use my wiki in many respects. Besides the kids, that's where I've been putting my time in. I could not live without that contraption. I've currently been writing to penpals [[Sphygmus]] and [[kickscondor]].
Today at 10:49 PM
Having difficult conversations with recent ex-Google and ex-FB employees about the work they've done, the monsters they've helped build, etc. (good times).
Today at 10:50 PM
Have a job as an afterschool teacher. That's been interesting; reminds me of where I grew up. These kids have nothing.
Today at 10:51 PM
At a public school?
Today at 10:51 PM
Aye, right down the road. Some of the kids in my neighborhood who play with mine attend it.
Today at 10:52 PM
Been playing magic on cockatrice with the kids (we all write about the games). We are playing goblins mirror until they have a 40% winrate against me. Will start doing small bits of construction from there. Learning the second deck will take much less time than the first, I believe.
Today at 10:54 PM
Have you been keeping up with legacy? I haven't really the past 5 years, other than top being banned
Today at 11:00 PM
Not at all.
Today at 11:00 PM
That's awesome that they play. I feel like that's really good for kids to play a game like magic growing up
Today at 11:00 PM
Really builds a lot of cognitive skills
Today at 11:00 PM
Agreed. There are many things I can relate to magic, especially for my son.
Today at 11:01 PM
What do you relate it to?
Today at 11:02 PM
Discrete math. Empiricism. Dialectic. The notion of The Good. Some game theory. What it means to tell ourselves different kinds of stories with cardboard. Programming.
Today at 11:05 PM
Interesting. How do you relate it to dialectic and the Good? (to topics near and dear to my heart lol)
Today at 11:06 PM
Two* oh God I've become a person who makes that typo lol
Today at 11:09 PM
Pet peeve of mine
Today at 11:09 PM
My son picked up Skullclamp that was laying next to my desk and 
asked me about it. He thought it was powerful. We asked what made a card
 good for the sake of winning. We tried to construct cards that would 
defeat all the others by definition, and then slowly ratchet our way 
down to clamp.
Today at 11:09 PM
It's a card that warps the metagame. I think the dialectic can often be a kind of warfare and wrestling. It is interesting to look at those things which defeat the metagames that otherwise might wrestle with each other undisturbed.
Today at 11:11 PM
We are forced to ask why we play games. What are games good for?
Today at 11:11 PM
You're a good dad lol
Today at 11:13 PM
You have made my evening, sir. =) Thank you.
Today at 11:14 PM
No seriously. Most people would never engage their kids with that kind of stuff, especially in a relatable way
Today at 11:15 PM
I prepare for them for the desert. It is a dangerous place. I must equip them with everything I have.
Today at 11:16 PM
Shit, seriously. God knows what kind of world they're going to have to deal with. Legitimately. I think the future is more open than it has been since, I dunno, the advent of the industrial revolution?
Today at 11:17 PM
I really hope they pursue The Good with everything inside them. We are lucky to be able to homeschool.
Today at 11:20 PM
It's interesting that you call it more open!
Today at 11:20 PM
That may be correct; I will have to think about it.
Today at 11:20 PM
Thus far, my prediction becomes worse and worse. It feels like Golem's rise becomes increasingly inevitable. I feel closing in on us.
Today at 11:21 PM
Mass psychopathy (or enabling it) sucks.
Today at 11:22 PM
Open in the sense of uncertain
Today at 11:22 PM
I am increasingly confident (though I am rarely certain about anything) that we have lost. But, my name is h0p3; so...I'm going to fight anyways.
Today at 11:24 PM
I'm definitely confident we've lost on climate change. I think that's a done deal
Today at 11:25 PM
Agreed.
Today at 11:25 PM
But, clearly, if we can't control our own climate, the answer must be to hop on a rocket and try to create a livable habitat from scratch on Mars! Right?!
Today at 11:26 PM
Like a virus
Today at 11:27 PM
The Matrix is more and more prescient by the day, though not in the ways we might have thought it was vis-a-vis AI etc
Today at 11:28 PM
The Rand-Locke Memeplex is winning in our computational brains.
Today at 11:28 PM
No doubt!
Today at 11:28 PM
That is my favorite movie still. I recently went to do a commentary (line by line) on the script.
Today at 11:28 PM
That is a movie we talk about all the time.
Today at 11:28 PM
I fear it's even worse than Rand. Marx totally nailed it. Everything is so commodified we cant even think differently anymore
Today at 11:29 PM
I've been turning back to the late 90s more out of nostalgia lol
Today at 11:29 PM
I agree! I think that's where Rand takes us. It is Golem.
Today at 11:31 PM
Its deeper than Rand though
Today at 11:32 PM
Rand is more a symptom than an ultimate cause
Today at 11:32 PM
Just a harbinger of the Last Man already on his way
Today at 11:33 PM
Yes. I'll agree to that. I cannot speak effectively (or perhaps humbly) enough of The End or The Beginning when it comes causation (though that may be further than you wish to go, I am not sure).
Today at 11:34 PM
Would you be okay with the claim that the agential cause is selfishness?
Today at 11:35 PM
By agential cause do you mean something like efficient cause?
Today at 11:37 PM
I'm very wary of identifying as primary or ultimate causes here individual affects or choices
Today at 11:38 PM
Agreed on both counts. Though I am not a compatibilist (I have tried hard to become one; I simply cannot unsee what I see). I do not think The Unmoved Mover is an agent (or I would not presume to anthropomorphize it). I think it is The Good. It gives meaningful meaning to everything, including Itself.
Today at 11:40 PM
I was talking about the human cause of the enslavement and demise of our species (and others).
Today at 11:41 PM
So, efficient cause should be fine with me. What makes it wrong or bad, however, is not something which I believe humans can construct or cause.
Today at 11:42 PM
In game theory, in perfect competition, the winning strategy is called 
Tit-for-tat (T4T). It means if you cooperate, then I continue to 
cooperate; if you defect, then so will I. The best strategy in a game of
 imperfect competition is Tit-for-Two-Tats (T42T), which just is to say 
that I am forgivingly retaliating (turn the other cheek, but only to 
some extent...a standard which I assume is contextual and basically virtue-theoretic). The dialectic 
among people can be in perfect competition, or we can choose to
play another strategy. From the math I've seen, a sufficient percentage 
of players using T42T will eventually defeat T4T (or worse). I consider 
T42T to be the game-theoretic expression of The Golden Rule. That's my 
practical goal: champion T42T as the primitive algorithm for 
constructing decentralized networks (automating it as far as I can digitally and enforcing it in my social encounters).
