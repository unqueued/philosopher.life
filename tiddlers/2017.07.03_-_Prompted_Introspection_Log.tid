!! Respond to the following quotes:

<<<
The visible world is the invisible organization of energy.
<<<

I must admit, this quote is so poetic sounding that we might take it to be pseudo-scientific. That isn't to say physics doesn't have an elegance to it, but rather I'm cautious of unscientific people who employ the word "energy." They are usually retarded. This happens to be true enough though, particularly when we talk about visibility with the naked human eye.

I think it is a highly reductive claim. I think it's meant to inspire people. It's almost spiritual, but it need not be interpreted as such. It seems very meaningful. As long as we don't impart telos to that organization, posit an organizer, etc., then we're still in fairly neutral territory.

Setting aside conversational implicature for a moment, I take "is the" to be a strong indicator of the identity predicate in my translation. Quite a few metaphysicians would take umbrage at this reduction, even those who take themselves to be destroying metaphysics. 

This takes on a particular point of view in ontology. Does what emerges have privilege? "Visibility" just is layers of abstractions upon abstractions, objects from objects upon objects, and so on. How does one provide a reason for this privilege in order to escape the reduction?

I fear we cannot. At best, we give meaning to ourselves, and that's it. There is no meaning which escapes that sphere of our reason-giving. It lacks objectivity in a way. It seems as though we lack access to anything objectively meaning giving outside this invisibly organized energy (physics). 

The post-modern problematic of physics is not solved. The theoretical physicists and celebrity physicists are terrible at even understanding the problem itself, which is sad.
