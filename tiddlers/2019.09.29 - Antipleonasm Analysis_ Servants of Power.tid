title: 2019.09.29 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Servants of Power

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Experts are by definition the servants of those in power: they don't really THINK, they just apply their knowledge to problems defined by the powerful.
<<<

By whose definition? Yours? Presumably, you take yourself to be an expert on the definition, and therefore, the consequent applies to you, right? Surely this is hyperbole or missing something important. I'll agree that masters in the material dialectic dictate the arena and terms of combat to some non-trivial extent. Obviously, centralized political [[power]] infects, harnesses, and exploits the expertise of experts. The elite aim to handpick //experts// who justify and promote the status quo or continued centralization of power. Obviously, objective epistemic authority isn't defined by [[power]] because it isn't a subjective matter beyond what is necessary for particularizing the context. Further, experts are clearly thinking (which doesn't mean they do so well for the sake of [[The Right]]), even if only to apply their knowledge to problems defined by the powerful in such a way the [[power]]ful deem acceptable.
