title: 2020.01.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Boogie Woogie Woogie

* Woke at 9
** Solid enough. =)
* Shower
* Offspring's rooms are looking saner.
** I need to pour more time in my son's. 
** Worked on their lists
* My side of my room appears complete. 
** Also, I have finally graduated to my {[[Dream]]} of using laundry baskets as drawers on my steel shelf. Why fucking fold or sort laundry? Completely pwned that problem for now. XD.
*** Daughter and I had fun rebuilding the shelf to fit the baskets perfectly.
* Men came to help move the couches. We sat for a bit, drank water, and talked. They asked about [[m16]], so we talked about it for a bit. 
** Excited to finally have things to sit on in the living room. 
* Went to see another car. Old Honda, Stick, 140k miles, good shape and felt right (though still don't know about the engine yet), $1.3k.
** Feels like they took good care of it, and they seemed trustworthy enough.
** We took it. Talked with the family selling. Interesting couple. 
** The way my wife hides money on her person is so ghetto and so fucking hawt. =)
** I'm excited to teach my offspring to drive stick.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
** My wife was actually bored today at work. They treat her like a human, and even tell her to slow down. She seemed almost unhappy that it was a slow day.
*** Being exploited at Milligan is painful to look at. I will never be able to thank her enough. She has saved our family single-handedly. 
* Tacos
* //Psych//
* Fell asleep in her lap.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 2?
