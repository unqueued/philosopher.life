If stealing 100% of the product of someone else's labor is slavery, at what percentage is it not slavery?

Carson Carnac: "A question primarily taken seriously usually only by Libertarians and Marxists." Here Locke and Marx are frenemies taking seriously what actual moral Hohfeldian property rights entail. 

The more clever reactionary enlightened centrists will attempt to attack the antecedent with a counterexample of stealing which so obviously isn't slavery. Surely, we've either misunderstood the word "stealing" or "slavery."

My goto example is the impoverished mother with a starving baby who walks into Wal-mart and takes //her and her baby's// formula without giving Wal-mart's representatives any money for it. In an oversimplified vacuum, we can point to a chain of production which made that container of formula, and the woman is legally stealing. In that vacuum, she's taking someone else's labor, and none of us want to say she's enslaving them except a Libertarian (and that's because they live in that vacuum). 

She's not morally stealing though,<<ref "w">> and that's why we can't say she's enslaving the Walton's et. al. No, we have stolen from her, and she's taking what she already had the right to. The correct answer is that we're enslaving her and her child, and she's fighting back. I think she's very slow in her escalation (the radical punishments on the poor are going to make her overly conversative here), and well within her rights to more violently defend herself and her child against systematic abuse than she has. In fact, we owe her that on her behalf. She already had a right to our labor, our minds and bodies. She and her baby have a right to some kind of life we are disabling or taking from her.

Indeed, there is a 1984esque problem in Kant's definition of Freedom which appears to be a kind of slavery in a postmodern world which aims to relativize who we have a right to be so far that it denies moral realism, and the centrists are those who will act like they just don't have a duty to try to quantify or speak of it.<<ref "u">>

Stealing and slavery do not conceptually peel apart as we'd like, but there are some kinds of slavery which merit stronger reactions than others though. On this spectrum, the sort which isn't so egregious we're more likely to call stealing. We reserve the term slavery for more extremes kinds of stealing. Unfortunately, some think they are therefore distinct. All of these terms are reducible to a Hohfeldian network of morally justified property rights generated by the [[CI]]. 

Since the origin of this may have been Libertarian, I'll address it. Paying your taxes is not conceptually wrong, and in fact, it is obligated in justified states (and even a sane minimal statist can agree to that). Not paying your taxes can be a form of stealing and slavery, even if only regarding those who must make up for your choice (including future generations). 

Marxism is asking the same question. What is missing from Marxism, of course, is a metaethical foundation which justifies and expands upon the nature of inequality. He's got the crucial descriptive piece for interpreting survival of the most effectively masked psychopathic power centralization in the material dialectic for us. Slavery and stealing are ethically normative concepts which only make sense with [[The Moral Law]]; without it, you only have machines.
