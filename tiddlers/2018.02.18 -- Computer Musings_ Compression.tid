title: 2018.02.18 -- Computer Musings: Compression

I'm all about the awful hacks as of late. Crontab to the rescue of a skidiot!

So, basically, it's either RSS feed plugin or Deluge itself, which is functionally the same. I'm leaving the hourly deluged restart. It's not a service I actually care about in 100% uptime; I'd be just fine with 95% uptime. Aggressive seeding from it seems to outpace even 100% uptime rtorrent, so I don't have a good enough reason to switch over besides my pride.

Also, I've not found a way to force compression on ATL's lighttpd to recompress each update from lighttpd itself. The site requires someone to interact with lighttpd as a server to force compression. wget appears to be the wrong tool, so I'm going w3m. I could just do it on directory changes, but fuck it. I'm lazy. So, I'm going to burn bandwidth:

`* * * * * w3m philosopher.life -dump > /dev/null`

That does the trick.
