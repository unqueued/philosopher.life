title: 2019.01.06 - Prompted Introspection: Procrasturbatory Chore

!! What is your least favorite chore and why?

I'm lucky enough to have completed this before: [[2017.11.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Least Favorite Chore]]. My least favorite chore is the sum all chores that I don't like. They all stack up into this monster that I procasturbate around.

I really don't like chores that don't serve a direct functional purpose from the ground up. I don't like caring about appearances outside of function (though being easy on my eyes is a function). I don't like when I have to work harder because of someone else's mistakes. I think I find dealing with most humans to be a chore that is not joyous. I am lucky to have people in my life who are a pleasure to know, to help, to be with, and to model in my head.
