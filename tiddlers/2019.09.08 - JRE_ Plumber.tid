My brother spoke me to about working on a plumbing problem. Rebecca's grandfather did some of the work, and it's a hodgepodge of the materials available. There's some oldschool stuff in there, and unfortunately, a lot of it is rotting. My brother was all set to solve it, but several problems appeared which he could not have known about. So, he is stuck with a plumber's bill now. He was understandably disappointed. This sucks. =/

We got cut off, but it was good hear his voice.
