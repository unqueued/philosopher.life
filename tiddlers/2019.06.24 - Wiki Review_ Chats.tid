** He knows exactly what I find freaky. =)
* [[2019.06.19 - JRE: Crazy Dark Morning]]
** I'm grateful that he was able to get through it. I'm still trying to get a feel for the transition as best I can.
* [[2019.06.23 - JRE: Proudad]]
** He had much higher praise over the phone. I'm glad he thought about it. He says my daughter clearly has a point of view and the ability to write a stream-of-consciousness which sounds like her. He's seen how far my son has come. I think it gives both of us some [[hope]].
* [[2019.06.12 - K: Uninterested Family]]
** I am lucky to have any family who are interested in significant relationships.
* [[2019.06.13 - K: Dissertationaletters]]
** I take it that he's not going to be reading it. That's a shame. 
* [[2019.06.14 - K: Ace Rhymes]]
** He's not consistent in his judgment here. 
* [[2019.06.17 - K: Episode]]
** My assumption is it's still on his mind. 
* [[2019.06.20 - K: Have a Good Isekai]]
** It's like another world. I'm probably not a very useful discussion partner on this issue either.
* [[2019.06.18 - Tasha: Inspections]]
** Talked with Esteban, and he says they aren't moving? They seem to be changing their minds quite a bit.
* [[2019.06.10 - AA: Doing Okay]]
** I am glad she chose to contact me.
* [[2019.06.16 - AA: Everyone Behaves]]
** It's been over a week. I seem to be initiating and trying to hold up the conversation far more.
* [[2019.06.23 - Prompted Introspection: Primetime]]
** I hope to help my children use their plasticity and accelerated learning to the best of our abilities. I don't know what else to do for them, but I think we are starting to have a semblance of routine and methodology which is bearing fruit.
* [[2019.06.23 - Wiki Review: Lucky]]
** I have so many thoughts for the letter already.
* [[2019.06.23 - TDL: Wreck]]
** We got some of that done. It was a good day.
* [[2019.06.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Mainstream]]
** It's been a privilege, sir.
* [[2019.06.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Amazing Weekend]]
** Completed. My wife is already tired again. She's working her ass off. Rain + migraine + work is terrible. 
* [[2019.06.23 - Family Log: Borfday]]
** It was one of the better sabbaths we've had in a long time.
* [[Arrogance]]
** This one is hilarious and necessary. I'm glad to be working on it.
