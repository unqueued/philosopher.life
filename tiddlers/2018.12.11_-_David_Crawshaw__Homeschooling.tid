I'm sorry for the very late reply. Thank you for {[[contact]]}ing me, and please let me know if I can {[[help]]} you. It is not my goal to be rude to my guests, and I should have responded earlier to you.<<ref "e">>

<<<
Thanks for the link h0p3, I'm reading my way through. 
<<<

[[Kicks]] thinks with and about you [[here|https://www.kickscondor.com/searching-the-creative-internet]], and I see he tweeted you as well.

IIRC, you mention that you received many responses and links regarding that older post. I'd love to know if you were sent anything pertinent or interesting on the matter.

<<<
I also find your site (public inbox) pretty interesting.
<<<

Thank you. I've never heard it referred to as a public inbox before. You are correct: that is one significant property of my [[Find The Others]] project. If you dig, you may find this wiki is more than that;<<ref "l">> I have a hard time describing what it is.<<ref "r">> I would argue it is something like me trying to upload my mind into a single document.<<ref "d">> I [[hope]] to continue to grow this rabbithole. We'll see where it goes, eh?

<<<
Homeschooling in particular is something I've been thinking a lot about, because schools are so amazingly bad. Not clear I can do any better though.
<<<

To my chagrin, I do not think I am a [[good]] father or teacher in many respects (especially given how much time I've spent on it). I can only do my [[fff]]ingly best to [[Be A Good Dad]]. With that caveat, if you have any questions about homeschooling, I will do my best to answer them for you. Looking at my (albeit poor) model of who you are and your teaching style, it is obvious to me that you are clearly a capable teacher (which isn't to say you wouldn't face significant challenges like the rest of us). I think you are being too modest here; you clearly have the means. You have, at the bare minimum, 20-30 IQ points on the average school teacher and the kind of life experiences that few have. You have a background in both STEM and the Humanities (though, I see very little about the latter from you). I am convinced that if you really wanted to do it, you could.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
