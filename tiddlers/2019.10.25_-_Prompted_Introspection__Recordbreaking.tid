title: 2019.10.25 - Prompted Introspection: Recordbreaking

!! If you could break the Guiness Book of Records it would be for?

I can't say I respect the world records they aim to record that much. It also seems difficult to record or prove the sorts of records I would fancy breaking. It is unlikely that my purpose aligns with becoming the sort of person who would break those kinds of records either. It may be the case that my hypergraphia will result in having handwritten more than most humans in history, though I cannot speak to its quality. I suppose that might be a kind of record I could morally break. I'm not convinced I will live long enough to break it though. I [[hope]] to spend what time I have wisely.
