!! I wish there were no more.....

Questions like this to reasonably answer. It would be, like, amazing. I can't wait to remove it from the list. Enumerating what is indefensible is a great starting place. I wave my magic wand, and you resolve the function for me. I don't have to say anything more, right? =). It's not much different than asking what I wish for more generally (double negation).
