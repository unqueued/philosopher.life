title: 2018.09.14 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Have I mentioned how much I fucking hate Percy? Of course, I think my own donors would accuse me of something similar. My wiki, of course, is a very clear attempt to communicate...you have the chance to passively and anonymously think about it. You'll always be accountable to it.

My distrust in media outlets, my attempts at Straussian interpretations of realpolitik writings, and my attempts to pierce my filter bubbles clearly have origins in this series (among many). I think my adoration of Orwell's writings come out of this as well.

I can't say I think Rowling is a good human, nor can I say I agree to everything in these books, but I am so grateful to have shape myself with these books. As an illiterate, poor kid brainwashed by fundie dark-triads, these books have acted as valuable anchors and gateways to evolving and seeing what matters most.

My willingness to rebel and attempt to revolutionize is right here in that silly cartoon of an "Order of the Pheonix." The type-2 anarchist (who still believes in the calling to establish the morally justified rule of law...like MLK) view is right here.

I whip my wand out for every little thing... =)

Sirius is the rash manboy in me.

I <3 Mrs. Weasley.

How does Dumbledore not already know Voldemort was back? This doesn't make sense. This is a problem.
