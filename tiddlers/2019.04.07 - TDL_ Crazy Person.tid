title: 2019.04.07 - TDL: Crazy Person

* Probably won't be playing much chess with my kiddos.
** They don't appear particularly interested, and that's fine. Lots to do.
* We didn't get carrots and onions. I think hotdogs, frozen veggies, bacon, and something else may have been forgotten.
** My wife and I were talking the entire time, and I had to stand and think a bunch like a crazy person in the middle of a public space.
*** Yay. =)
* [[kicks]] has me thinking. Lots of work to do.
* Work. 5th seem to be getting rougher.
* Summer jobbos, homie?
