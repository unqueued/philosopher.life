title: 2018.08.13 - BAGD: Try Hard

The suffering of trying your best is part of what gives it so much meaning.

[[Work!]]

Compatibilizing our reality maps comes in different [[dok]]. 

You need to find the rational way to disagree with me. You can't say "yup" all the way down, but you also need to learn to be wise in your risk-taking for disagreeing.

One of the things I really hope to be for you is a slave computer that does damned good work helping you think about the world. I want you to harness me like a mainframe that is constantly searching for the truth on your behalf.

* Disagree with your teacher.
** Play to win. You better be able to show they are wrong.
** Don't just play grammar and tone-policing games. Literally aim to point to semantical problems. Be intentional!
* Give examples that highlight where you agree; demonstrate mastery of the concept.
* We must understand and engage in a dialectic with each other through our wikis especially.

We are like computers engaged in a kind of non-zero-sum cooperative game with each other. Let us radically cooperate. We need the best hardware and software tools we can find. 

I want to be the autistic savant in your back pocket.

I need to be able to communicate very effectively with you. That's what we are doing here. I want the bandwidth, throughput, the signal-to-noise ratio, the protocols, the compression, the beautiful structures and streams to be the most epic of human history. We can do it. I see how.

I'm trying to be a rational computer with you, including given the faith and necessity of our emotions in being rational.

There is an asymmetry you must use wisely, and please, use it to your advantage: 

* My vocation is to be the best computer I can "for you," in [[gfwiwcgws]] terms, given the standard of the good of your personal/contextualist identity.
* You need to be a good computer for yourself, and set aside what is good for me. Think about the good of me insofar as it is the good of you. I literally believe that is what I owe you as your parent. Creating you means I owe my life to you.

We are trying to build a hardware+software [[Ithkuil]] with each other, to be fluent, to maximize and optimize our joint computation together.

Empathy is where we have developed the right models, theories of mind, taking each other's ends up (as we can understand them best) as being our own projects and ends as well. We must weigh them together, we must have each other count as a "vote" in [[The Original Position]] that we are engaged in.

Grind with me. Whenever I say something is crazy important, I think you owe me an explanation of why it's not. You must test yourself, your ideas, beliefs, and desires against mine. You should do so carefully, wisely, boldly in the right ways, cautiously [[irwartfrr]] too.

The wiki is a means to communicate what might otherwise be infeasibly-based ineffable to each other. Modality here is one of computation.

The wikis are a strong way to build trust in each other. It's way for us to have a distributed record of our dialectics with profound transparency and safety. It gives us some guarantees and options which we couldn't have otherwise. It's a profound way to transmit our representations to each other systematically. This is a protocol for communicating with profound dimensionality.

The wiki closes incommensurable communication gaps we otherwise couldn't.

The wiki is a perceptual tool for improving upon and avoiding the risks of being wrong given the perceptual vagueness of the world. The wiki is trustworthy lamp unto your feet as you traverse the phenomenological hyperreality of your [[4DID]]. 

We get better at telling ourselves and others the stories of who we are with wikis.

We have to practice disagreeing with each other.
