title: 2017.08.18 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up extra early.
** Wasn't able to find my keys right before I had to leave. They weren't in my bowl. This caused me significant anxiety. I need those keys to get my tools and safety gear.
* Worked hard today. I'm quite sore. I am so ready to relax this weekend. 
* I was able to talk with all my family during breaks. I loved it. I'm so happy we have these phones.
* Talked to Chris
* Cannabliss
* Talked to JRE. 
* We went out to eat tonight, Indian. It was a wonderful meal, and we had a great conversation. It was amazing.
** It was a treat among treats.
* Couldn't swim because they rainstorms.
* Our car is still in the shop. Thankfully, Chris told me to call him if I needed a ride next week. That's really nice of him.
** I'm glad they are paying. 
* Wrote in my wiki. I'm glad that I finally get to write and enjoy it. It has been a while.
