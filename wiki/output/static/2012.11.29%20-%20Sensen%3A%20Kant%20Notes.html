Oliver Sensen</p><p>1.	The Problem</p><p>Autonomy is a popular moral concept. In everyday usage, 'autonomy' refers to self-governance. We do not want to be coerced by others, but to be free to make our own decisions. Our common notion of autonomy has three aspects of self-governance to it:</p><p>‚Äì: Autonomy is considered to be a capacity one possesses, a capacity to govern oneself.
‚Äì: It is at the same time a goal of one's individual striving, to actually govern oneself.
‚Äì: We claim it as a moral right, an entitlement to govern ourselves independently of foreign influence. </p><p>But although each of us likes to make our own decisions, it is harder to pinpoint the moral significance of self-governance. Why should personal autonomy be moral autonomy as well? In particular there are three problems that have been raised with regard to autonomy:</p><p>‚Äì: (1) It does not seem that choice by itself is morally valuable (cf. Valdman). It depends on the choice. A murder committed freely and in cold blood seems worse than an act committed in the heat of passion. The mere fact that something is my choice does not make it morally good. 
‚Äì: (2) It is not clear that one has to respect the capacity for self-governance in others (cf. Gibbard). Imagine a scenario of tribal warfare or a Hobbesian state of nature: Knowing that the other wants to govern himself does not by itself generate a requirement to respect him, but is a reason to be more afraid of him. Just wanting to be free does not yet yield a moral right. 
‚Äì: (3) Autonomy also does not seem to settle anything in moral theory. For instance, autonomy does not seem to undermine moral realism (cf. Shafer-Landau). Moral realism would as little undermine the autonomy of the agent as chemical laws impair one's self-governance. </p><p>Autonomy seems to be something we want, and we demand of others that they respect it, but so far is is not clear that it yields any moral obligation. This is in stark contrast to the Kantian claim that only autonomy can yield moral obligation. </p><p>2.	Kantian Autonomy</p><p>For the Kantian, autonomy is not just self-governance, but self-legislation. Self-legislation has the following features:</p><p>‚Äì: In contrast to mere self-governance, self-legislation emphasizes the importance of laws.
‚Äì: But the emphasis is not on laws that one gives oneself empirically, such as a New Year's resolution. For such resolutions are not strictly binding. One can always unbind oneself.
‚Äì: The law is therefore not an empirically chosen one, but a constitutive law of one's own reason. One's reason commands this law prior to one's conscious awareness (akin to a principle of non-contradiction). The law governs the function of moral reasoning. 
‚Äì: But autonomy does not emphasize the content of the law, rather that one's reason makes the law obligatory or binding. For the mere content of the law does not yet say why one should follow the law (akin to the difference between a parliament which formulates a law and a head of state who signs it into law and thereby makes it obligatory). </p><p>The Kantian claims that only this autonomy can yield moral obligation. </p><p>3.	Kantian Autonomy and Moral Obligation</p><p>The Kantian argument has several parts:</p><p>‚Äì: The Kantian claims that we hold morality to be necessary and universal. There is support for this idea in the literature on the moral/conventional distinction (cf. Nichols). 
‚Äì: The next claim is that neither a morality based on (a) desires, nor on (b) positive commands, nor on (c) moral realism could yield a necessary and universal morality.
‚Äì: (a) Desires are relative and contingent and cannot ground universal and necessary moral laws.
‚Äì: (b) Positive commands (e.g., from one's parents) need a desire to motivate one to comply.
‚Äì: (c) Moral realism too would be dependent upon desires, according to the Kantian. Why?</p><p>4.	Kantian Autonomy and Moral Realism</p><p>The Kantian would give the following epistemic argument:</p><p>‚Äì: If moral realism holds that there are (non-natural) moral properties that exist independently of a particular human stance, then one still has to discover these properties somehow.
‚Äì: All knowledge begins with the sense. For we run into contradiction regarding topics that go beyond the senses (e.g., free will), and we have not made any progress on these issues.
‚Äì: The five senses do not discover a (non-natural) moral property.
‚Äì: Therefore the property could only be discovered by a feeling of pleasure.
‚Äì: Pleasure is relative and contingent and cannot yield a universal and necessary moral law.</p><p>The moral realist would be unimpressed wit the Kantian argument: (a) The epistemic argument does not establish that (non-natural) moral properties do not exist; (b) the moral realist can argue that reason can discover the moral properties. Against this, the Kantian would reply:</p><p>‚Äì: (a) The moral property would be irrelevant for us. Pleasure would be the only thing we have.
‚Äì: (b) The Kantian would aim to shift the burden of proof. Since there is no agreement in moral matters, what is our positive indication that there really are independent moral properties?</p><p>Again the realist would be unimpressed wit the reply. Disagreement does not mean that there is no truth. It could be that there are moral experts, or that special training is needed to see the truth.</p><p>The argument sees to have reached an impasse. Neither side can refute the other, nor can either side establish its own claim. It is merely that intuitions are pitched against each other. </p><p>5.	Conclusion</p><p>Kantian autonomy is not undermined by the initial objections: (1) It does not imply that choice as such is valuable, nor that (2) the capacity to choose gives one a right, nor (3) does it fall victim to the analogy with chemical laws. (Chemical laws do not undermine self-governance, but they also do not impose an unconditional obligation on the agent. Only if one wants something do they limit one's options.) But it rests on two assumptions: that morality is necessary and universal, and that reason cannot discover and be moved by (non-natural) moral properties.</p><p>Aspects of Autonomy</p><p>Autonomy</p><p>‚Äì: Literally 'self-legislation' (sf. GMS 4:431; Mrong 29:629); or ‚Äúeigene Gesetzgebung‚Äù (KpV 5:33).
‚Äì: What is legislation? For instance: a) Does it establish the content of the law, or b) does it make the law obligatory?
‚Äì: Kant seems to hold b): ‚ÄúOne who commands through a law is the lawgiver. He is the author of the obligation [‚Ä¶], but not always the author of the law‚Äù (MS 6:227; cf. Mrong 29:633).
‚Äì: What is the self? It could refer a) to states: ‚Äúautonomy of states‚Äù (ZeF 6:346), b) but not to an empirical self, otherwise ‚Äúthe one imposing obligation could always release the one put under obligation‚Äù (MS 6:417), c) most often it refers to the will or pure reason: ‚ÄúPure reason [‚Ä¶] gives (to the human being) a universal law which we cal the moral law.‚Äù (KpV 5:31)</p><p>Autonomy as a condition of possibility of morality</p><p>‚Äì: ‚ÄúAutonomy [‚Ä¶] as the supreme principle of morality‚Äù (GMS 4:440)
‚Äì: Only autonomy can yield moral obligation (cf. GMS 4:441-5; Mrong 29:620-8):
	‚Äì: We hold morality to be necessary and universal (cf. GMS 4:389).
	‚Äì: All other theories cannot yield a necessary or universal obligation.
	‚Äì: Empirical theories are based on inclinations which are contingent and relative.
	‚Äì: Rational principles are empty (perfection) or rest on fear and reward (theological).
‚Äì: ‚ÄúBy explicating the generally received concept of morality we showed only that an autonomy of the will [‚Ä¶] lies at its basis.‚Äù (GMS 4:445)</p><p>Autonomy as moral command</p><p>‚Äì: Autonomy is something that is demanded of the agent in one formula of the Categorical Imperative: ‚Äúact only so that the will could regard itself as at the same time giving universal law through its maxim.‚Äù (GMS 4:434)
‚Äì: The purpose of this formula is ‚Äúto indicate in the imperative itself the renunciation of all interest, in volition from duty, by means of a determination the imperative contains [‚Ä¶], namely the idea of the will of every rational being as a will giving universal law‚Äù (GMS 4:431f.). 
‚Äì: What exactly is commanded, e.g., to have a) a specific justification, or b) a cast of mind? For Kant these seem to be the same in this case.</p><p>Autonomy as a descriptive property</p><p>‚Äì: 'Autonomy' does not only refer to something one can and should do, but also to a realized capacity:
‚Äì: ‚ÄúAutonomy of the will is the property [Beschaffenheit] of the will by which it is a law to itself (independently of any property of the object of volition).‚Äù (GMS 4:441, 447)
‚Äì: As such it is the same as positive freedom: ‚Äúthis lawgiving of its own on the part of pure [‚Ä¶] practical reason is freedom in the positive sense‚Äù (KpV 5:33).</p></div>
