9 HR AGO
Not bad! Doing some homework. 

How are you?
9 HR AGO
Analyzing poetry with a new critic perspective is so strange.
9 HR AGO
What's strange about it to you? There are some aspects of that close-reading style I like, but I have my worries about it too. I don't know much about poetry though. I'm still a noob on that front.
9 HR AGO
Homework is good.
9 HR AGO
I feel like it’s more or less a massive over analysis of the poem, which feels.....incorrect? But my professor seems to like what I’ve written so far so maybe it’s fine
9 HR AGO
REDACTED
9 HR AGO
The poem is I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud
9 HR AGO
I’ve analyzed the first three stanzas thus far. I haven’t written my thesis or conclusion yet but basically I’m going to toy with the idea of “Loneliness VS Togetherness” and ultimately end up on “Loneliness =Togetherness”
9 HR AGO
reading.
9 HR AGO
It hasn’t had any revision and it’s also incomplete lol.
9 HR AGO
I totally understand. Don't worry.
9 HR AGO
Just feels weird writing this way, like it might not be new criticism.
9 HR AGO
What do you think counts as New Criticism?
9 HR AGO
To whatever extent you think it has weaknesses, you might footnote that. It will demonstrate to your teacher (assuming they aren't themselves New Critics) that you understand the boundaries.
8 HR AGO
I am a huge fan of close reading.
8 HR AGO
But, again, we are in poetry territory here, and I am not talented with standard literature either.
8 HR AGO
So, I'm just thinking out loud with you.
8 HR AGO
I’m not sure tbh. I feel like I’m mucking about on the doorstep of new criticism with what I have this far, but all of my claims just feel like shots in the dark. 

My professor seems to think I’m doing it correctly but it feels so weird.
8 HR AGO
I will definitely discuss that in my conclusion. I’m not overly fond of doing this for poetry. I feel like it would work a lot better for prose!
8 HR AGO
Well, what's weird about it?
8 HR AGO
I feel like I’m making a lot of educated guesses about Wordsworth’s intent without concrete evidence to back it up. Which is very new criticism because they could care less about author intent/ interpretation and only really care about what the words are illustrating on their own as art.
8 HR AGO
Just feels weird. Like I’m making baseless claims. Haha
8 HR AGO
Sounds like this one is worthy of your exploration, even on your own time.
8 HR AGO
So I guess I am on the right track... it’s just weird to me.
8 HR AGO
For sure!
8 HR AGO
I like looking at things analytically, but poetry is so subjective.
8 HR AGO
A strong claim, no doubt.
8 HR AGO
Maybe that’s the issue I’m having here
8 HR AGO
You should speak with [[k0sh3k]].
8 HR AGO
This is one of her raw talents (and she is the verbal genius, not me).
8 HR AGO
Oh! She might have a lot of insight on this. X)
8 HR AGO
Feel free to pass the link on! I plan to keep working at it this week.
8 HR AGO
Nice. Haha
8 HR AGO
I hope to press you on it later. It's a crucial problem to me. Almost all serious authors are serious readers who continually shape their point of view on this matter, imho. I'm obviously quite biased. I'm [[Straussian]], and I think historical context is part of effective exegesis. I think there is something extremely right about analysis (even of poetry, where every detail matters).
8 HR AGO
The ethical communications relationship between speakers and audiences is not a simple one.
8 HR AGO
That’s another thing! New critics don’t care about historical context. XD
8 HR AGO
They believe that art should be timeless and stand outside if that.
8 HR AGO
Of**
8 HR AGO
Aye.
8 HR AGO
Part of their method  is right on the money. It is necessary but insufficient, imho.
8 HR AGO
[[L]] hasn't been responding to me, btw. Is she okay?
8 HR AGO
She’s got a bad stomach bug. Been throwing up since Friday night. :(
8 HR AGO
That sucks!
8 HR AGO
I think she’s finally coming out of it but she still feels sick.
8 HR AGO
For sure.
8 HR AGO
No idea how I survived. Haha
8 HR AGO
lol
8 HR AGO
We see the same people and eat the same food. Just makes sense that we both should be sick. :thinking_face:
8 HR AGO
Well, I am sorry she is sick. I'm glad she is feeling better. I think it's funny you avoided it. Maybe literary analysis gives you an invisible protective aura.
8 HR AGO
:joy:
8 HR AGO
The true power of new criticism.
8 HR AGO
I also just cleaned my tower for the first time ever.
8 HR AGO
It was a fun experience.
8 HR AGO
How'd you do it?
8 HR AGO
I have never cleaned [[monster-10]] out before.
8 HR AGO
Just used compressed air in a can! The fans were the worst of it. Everything else was pretty clean.
8 HR AGO
So I had two fans in my card, a dedicated fan, the fan in my PSU, and the processor fan to clean.
8 HR AGO
Yup.
8 HR AGO
I started removing them and cleaning them until I got to the processor, then I just stood it up, and sprayed the air everywhere.
8 HR AGO
It was a messy experience, but I’d probably do it again. :sunglasses:
