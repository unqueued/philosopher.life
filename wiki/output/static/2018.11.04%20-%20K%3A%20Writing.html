12 HR AGO
No doubt!

How's your weekend going? What you up to today?
12 HR AGO
My brother and his family cake up Friday evening for D&amp;D and hanging out so that was nice. I ran a session from 2:30-8:00 and it was wonderful. 

Right now we‚Äôre sitting in church. Gonna hit the bookstore, go home and work on a paper all day. It‚Äôs the season to be busy!
12 HR AGO
Neat =)
12 HR AGO
What's your paper on?
12 HR AGO
What are you up to?
12 HR AGO
Going to compare and contrast two Upanishads with The Heart of Understanding. Should probably actually read them. Hahaha
12 HR AGO
Lol. I hear that.
12 HR AGO
I plan to work on that and only that for the next three days. I do have 10 other things to read and respond to as well sometime in those days also. English is fun
12 HR AGO
That sounds like good grindy fun, lol. =)
12 HR AGO
Oh yes. As soon as I‚Äôm done I plan to go back to my outline and retool it for a third attempt at my manuscript. I think I‚Äôm finally ready to tackle it with everything I‚Äôve learned in the past two years.
12 HR AGO
I‚Äôm in my last creative writing class too so my style should be pretty formed at this point. Looking at my other short stories I can see a huge difference in quality
12 HR AGO
Oh yeah, I can totally appreciate how quickly classes can help you grow.
12 HR AGO
I still have some of my undergraduate work. I do not look at my capstone work as being representative of my style (nor my content). The same with my masters. The same with my PhD. I'm gonna bet you have another decade to go on that front; I do not think you should assume it's pretty formed.
12 HR AGO
I could be wrong, ofc.
12 HR AGO
Formed for this project. ;) the reason why I stepped away from my manuscript is because my style rapidly changed between by two writing classes. I‚Äôm pretty sure if I went back and read my 7 chapters of first draft I would be sick to my stomach, hahaha.
11 HR AGO
Lawdy, I know that feel. It is satisfying to see the progress in our work.
11 HR AGO
To further elaborate, there would be different tone and style if I were to simply pick back up where I left off. Everything that precedes what I have already would look substantially different like it was written by someone else entirely. Editing isn‚Äôt going to fix that problem. Only a total rewrite. But that‚Äôs okay, because I‚Äôm excited to see what I can do now. :)
11 HR AGO
Heck yeah!
