5 HR AGO
Yeah I just woke up I had to work graveyard last night
4 HR AGO
Sorry
4 HR AGO
Do we still have time to hang out
4 HR AGO
Sure
4 HR AGO
See you soon!
4 HR AGO
I won't be able to stay long because I have to watch my mom today she is not feeling well

3 HR AGO
Nice. =)
3 HR AGO
That 360mm water cooler cooled my 9590 down to 30c idle to 43-45c load I'm very lucky
3 HR AGO
Nice.
3 HR AGO
Hey, you coming over?
3 HR AGO
Yea but it's going to be a bit I have to take mom to run her errands today there isn't any way that you could come to my house is there
3 HR AGO
My wife has the vehicle. I'll see what I can do. If we can't do it today, then maybe tomorrow?
3 HR AGO
I definitely want to help you setup your torrenting.
3 HR AGO
so, it makes sense for me to come over to your place
3 HR AGO
also, I need your email to invite you to IPTorrents
3 HR AGO
I'm so sorry it's just a hard day for me to find time to go anywhere on Sunday because I have to take care of mom but my email is
3 HR AGO
No, don't apologize. I totally understand. It's not a problem.
3 HR AGO
Thanks brother
3 HR AGO
Invite sent.
3 HR AGO
I'll try to come over and set it up with you tomorrow.
3 HR AGO
What time frames are best?
3 HR AGO
Anytime you want to
3 HR AGO
Is a USB 5v or 12v
3 HR AGO
5v output
3 HR AGO
but, probably depends on which USB spec you are using
3 HR AGO
depending on what you are doing, that is something worth looking up
3 HR AGO
I'm wanting to hook up a USB set of rgb strip to a cable off my psu
3 HR AGO
Which will probably be 12v
3 HR AGO
ah
3 HR AGO
you do like those LEDs
3 HR AGO
I'm up so late in the dark so often that I try to minimize it. I often disable them them or duct tape over them.
3 HR AGO
.
. They can be annoying sometimes
2 HR AGO
I bet the rgbs in the living room would drive you crazy
2 HR AGO
They are out of control
2 HR AGO
I'm just wanting a small red strip in my amd machine
2 HR AGO
Because I found some old red led fans in my junk room and installed them
2 HR AGO
Can you talk on the phone I hate texting
2 HR AGO
Yeah, your RGBs are intense. I think they are pretty. I think they'd wear me out.
1 HR AGO
Unfortunately, I can't talk on the phone at the moment.
1 HR AGO
I'm in the middle of family time now.
1 HR AGO
Have you installed Signal on your desktop?
1 HR AGO
That is how I use it 98% of the time.
1 HR AGO
I like typing because we can speak asynchronously, out of order, over long stretches of time.
1 HR AGO
No I forgot to will you remind me to in about a hour
1 HR AGO
Ah, I will try to remember. Should set a timer.
1 HR AGO
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;q=1+hour+timer
1 HR AGO
Is there anything you don't know about computers
1 HR AGO
Amazing dude
1 HR AGO
I am hobbyist. I am not an expert. I'd like to think I can speak with experts and they can (with effort) explain something very technical to me. I just love computers. =)
1 HR AGO
I
 Ha


A friend of mine was dissing my 8 core 9590 because he said that a quad core i7 would be better for video encoding which do you think is the best tell the truth it won't hurt my feelings
1 HR AGO
https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html
1 HR AGO
everything above the 9590 is going to be better for multi-threaded workloads
1 HR AGO
some i7's are better than your 9590 at multithreaded workloads, and some aren't.
1 HR AGO
it depends on the i7
1 HR AGO
The desktop in your living room destroys that 9590.
1 HR AGO
But, it better...
1 HR AGO
that 9590 can be bought for about ~100$ new right now
1 HR AGO
your i7 is hella more expensive
1 HR AGO
I bought a 8 core because I thought it would be faster
1 HR AGO
For video encoding, it is a fine choice.
1 HR AGO
I don't think you should feel bad about it at all.
1 HR AGO
The reason that the 9590 is so cheap is because you have to spend a lot more money on the cooling and top of the line motherboard
1 HR AGO
But It was still cheaper than a ryzan
1 HR AGO
as I said, I'd have gone with Ryzen
1 HR AGO
I did what I thought was best and cheapest but I was wrong
1 HR AGO
makes sense to me
1 HR AGO
It's supposed to take 2 hours to convert a 1 hour show and I can do it in 20 minutes
1 HR AGO
hopefully with torrents, you'll find it unnecessary to do your own encoding
1 HR AGO
I would rather use my high dollar system but my cable card is not compatible
1 HR AGO
I am surprised. What's not compatible?
1 HR AGO
But I like making and uploading torrent files too
1 HR AGO
once you get some linux under your belt, I think you should move to using a seedbox
1 HR AGO
The cable converter driver is not compatible with windows 10
1 HR AGO
Ah, we can work around that
1 HR AGO
Virtual Machine, pass it through
1 HR AGO
Really?
1 HR AGO
should work
1 HR AGO
if it's USB, yes
1 HR AGO
you have 64GB of RAM, and you're using like...8 of it, lol
1 HR AGO
There will be good ways to make use of it.
1 HR AGO
But won't that slow down the conversion process it runs of cat 5 cable
1 HR AGO
It depends. I think it's at least worth trying out.
