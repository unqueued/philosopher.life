<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>There are several mechanisms for saving TW. I use TiddlyBackup on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="monster-10.html">monster-10</a>. I'm not in love with it, and perhaps it is time to replace it. I have seen that thing gobble up 30GB of RAM before, rofl. Closing out Firefox isn't a big deal to me. I like that I have an actively developed off-the-shelf tool, but it bit me in the ass over the past few days.</p><p>I did not understand that TiddlyBackup wasn't working correctly on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a>'s machine (monster-12). It saved, but not everytime. I have no idea why; she solved it herself with a different extension. I set up my own account and had TiddlyBackup saving, but I didn't check to make sure backups were going through (if I saw that it wasn't, I would have known not to continue). Horrifingly, it started deleting random tiddlers <em>stealth</em> (which I only noticed because I was looking at filesizes of other archives)! It eventually deleted the entire html file (I've seen this before when beta-testing for PMario) with no backups local. Luckily, I have several other backup mechanisms to sort through the clusterfuck (archive on resilio sync is always awesome). With a few diffs, I found a clean copy, and with more effort was able to recover some of my work. But, it was late last night, and I said, &quot;fuck it.&quot; I reverted because I was nowhere near m10, I use super for i3's mod which doesn't play nice over nomachine, and I didn't have a real mouse. Doing this purely over commandline wasn't worth it when 16 hours later I could just do it on the real machine.</p><p>What really <em>saved</em> (ROFL! I crack myself up) my butt was <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%2524%253A%252Fplugins%252Ftiddlywiki%252Fsavetrail.html">$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/savetrail</a> - I just pushed those instead. Lol. Everything ever done on monster-12 made it in. Noice. Also, honorable mention to Dolphin's filter. </p><p>Semi-annoyingly, I couldn't find a simple and working way to import 150 jsons at once (the drag'n'drop method did not work either, despite multiple approaches), but I did find a nice way to manually add them at 1 per second with a kind of keyboard salute. I think there are several approaches that I could use for larger events here.</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h.html">j3d1h</a> has almost completed the git nightly and real-time work. We'll keep the complete locally and eventually torrentify it.</p></div>
