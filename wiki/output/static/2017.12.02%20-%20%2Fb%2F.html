<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today my brother claimed my search for meaning and my wiki are a waste of time (I think most people would agree with him). He thinks it will, in the end, make me no happier than just doing what 'every other dumb mother fucker' would do (a lovely phrase, I must borrow it). I had to ask him what he meant by this and why he thought it because I was kind of blown away by it. I'm strongly convinced the other direction. I have made enormous progress because of my wiki, and it seems like I still will. He seemed convinced, at least in the moment, that being reflective wasn't valuable. I told him I would have to think about it, so here I am.</p><p>After thinking about it, I'm worried he's lashing out here. He regularly makes excellent offensive arguments that require me to retreat and rethink. This wasn't one of them, imho. He went on to make a very poor argument about the irrelevance to our happiness of solving the moral problem for ourselves. I'm shocked he thinks that is true. That doesn't make sense at all, especially given what he knows and believes about the world. I don't think he's being consistent with himself when he claims that.</p><p>He agreed that it was possible for me to convince myself of the redpilled prescription, but was decidedly against the possibility that such a prescription really could enable me to be happier (despite complimenting me in saying I was logical and almost always followed through on what I believed was logical, i.e. my hypothetical/instrumental reasoning skills are strong). But, it is obvious that being morally good requires sacrificing your happiness for others, and he knows that. I tried to give examples of how psychopaths really can attain much higher levels of happiness (they are vampires, after all). I think he was trapped, and that's why he ended the conversation.</p><p>My brother wants to put Kant in a gimpsuit (his words), but not remember that he is doing it. He just wants to feel like a good person without actually being one (and I can appreciate that). He straight up claimed we are not morally accountable; we aren't autonomous moral agents. But, he also doesn't seem to know how to really use his newfound power. I think this is not the best way to put Kant in a gimpsuit; his method is clearly just cookie-cutter Liberal Guilt. That's not min-maxing your psychopathy at all. Recall, it is only in knowing the human is human when you use &quot;it&quot; that you've really vampire-consumed that gimp. He feels lost (and don't we all?). He's wrong about how to be an Objectivist Ubermensch. His argument falls apart. That's not like him.</p><p>Upon reflection, I think I understand why he lashed out. I think I upset him talking about his SO. We had been talking about the fact that she does a poor job distinguishing social conventions from the moral law in her reasoning. Essentially, while she is intelligent, she doesn't engage in the humanities (which translates to: isn't philosophical). I think he wanted to defend not being introspective, both hers and his.</p><p>We talked about a lot of things, as we usually do. We jump around a lot, go off on tangents, and branch very hard in our arguments (very few human beings I've met keep up on this branching). I remember complimenting him on his skepticism earlier in the conversation. I think it shows a very high standard. That may have not been a compliment in his eyes. I also said earlier that it seemed like he hadn't solved the moral problem for himself either (although, perhaps he thinks he has well enough, but...then the rest of his actions/beliefs don't make sense). I've definitely annoyed him in several ways. I'm glad he showed me his perspective. I think he wants me to stop showing him my perspective. I suppose I can do that. It makes our relationship a lot less meaningful, no doubt. </p><p>I decided much earlier this year that my wiki is a compatibility litmus test. You don't have to agree with it, but you do need to try to understand it, to reckon with it, and to some extent value it because...I take it to be a representation of me, if not part of who I am as some word-based cybernetic extension of my identity. i.e. Valuing who I am is part of being my friend. Not everyone is capable of being my friend, and most that are capable wouldn't want to. I get it. I wonder if he feels the same way, in another sense. I will think about it.</p></div>
