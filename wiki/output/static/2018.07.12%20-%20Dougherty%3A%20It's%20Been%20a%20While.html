It's where I do my thinking, and if it horrifies you, I apologize.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">0</sup></button> I beg you think carefully about the contents of {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Contact.html">Contact</a>} and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">Find The Others</a>; it is a matter of consent.</p><p>It's been almost two decades since we first met, and that somehow makes me feel old. I doubt you remember it, but the last time we spoke was ~6 years ago when I asked you to be a reference for me to enter a library science program. As luck would have it, I ended up going into Tulane's philosophy PhD program instead. I'm still wrapping my mind around it.</p><p>I look back at your classes at Elizabethtown Community College and feel truly lucky to have participated in them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">e</sup></button> IIRC, we read 1984, Brave New World (?), and On The Internet (Thinking in Action) in one of your classes; the works of all three authors continue to be important to my life. Thank you! My 12-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son are making their way through these books this year in their homeschooling. I don't know how to tell you what it means to me; words fail me. Whatever it is that you did to and for me is a non-trivial cause for my writing this wiki. I'm not sure what I'm doing with this artform, but I'm doing my best.</p><p>As a sheltered autistic kid<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">k</sup></button> interested in philosophy, religion, science fiction, and computers, you helped open the world up for me with a firehose. Thank you! You shaped me a great deal, and I'm glad you did. &quot;What [you] say does matter,&quot; and it always did.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">m</sup></button> I can't say I've been a good student,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">g</sup></button> but I hope to be one day.</p><p>Looking through your publicly available work,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">l</sup></button> I can see I've been far behind you on some similar trails. Forgive me for being an arrogant and slow learner. I'd be a fool not to ask you for guidance on the journey though. So, I've got to put you on spot, elder nomad: What's most true? What's most real? What matters most? Why? I'm still hunting my lost origin and telic whales like a madman out here in the desert. Please, help me find it.</p><p>I've got some assorted thoughts, questions, and comments too:</p><ul><li>How the hell did you end up in Elizabethtown, KY? It's serendipitous to my life. I would like to see/connect the dots which led to it.</li><li>How's Norway? <ul><li>Your move to Norway has only made more sense to me each passing year. My wife and I have talked about it many times since living in Thailand. </li><li>Now that you have lived outside the U.S. for so long in a nation known for its happiness and education, what do you think of your time in the US and the current state of the world? </li></ul></li><li>Speaking of cosmopolitanism, John Rawls (bless his heart) was schizophrenic on the issue, and it always killed me inside.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button> I will never understand how a man who understood The Categorical Imperative so thoroughly in his heuristic vision, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Original%2520Position.html">The Original Position</a>, ended up defending nationalism and the status quo in his later work. I hope the same thing doesn't happen to me! I swear to Seldon, the world is going crazy, and I feel the weight of it every day. I think you are feeling the weight, too.</li><li>I've read your paper, <em>Autism and Modular Minds in Elizabeth Moon's &quot;The Speed of Dark.&quot;</em> I will need to think more about it. <ul><li>I had to take a class on moral psychology before I even had a clue about what made me aneurotypical; I wish I knew I was autistic long ago (it would have helped). </li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.07.12%2520-%2520PPP%253A%2520Autism%2520and%2520Modular%2520Minds.html">I have some thoughts on your paper</a>.<ul><li>Forgive my ignorance. Perhaps you might have the missing puzzle pieces I'm not seeing. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhZ4342KzRc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhZ4342KzRc</a><ul><li>The sound of your voice and your accent are slightly different from what I remember.<ul><li>Your accent was always a point of interest for me. I've always had a hard time placing it.</li></ul></li><li>My gut instinct boils down to both simulation and translation as representations. From a functional perspective, they seem to be doing something very similar. Translation seems to be re-representing, but I'm not sure if that is important. The question for me is the origins and telos of both of these representational functions (roughly, &quot;why?&quot;)</li></ul></li><li>I've long been a fan of Clarke's work (IIRC, I was reading the Rama series as I was taking your classes) and jumped into Liu Cixin's trilogy last year.<ul><li>It was a pleasure to see your perspective on it! I regret I don't have anything to add to the conversation (you clearly see much further than I do).<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSB6YvZm7zA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSB6YvZm7zA</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://2017aclarkeodyssey.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://2017aclarkeodyssey.wordpress.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>I'm looking for media worth consuming. Do you have any recommendations?<ul><li>Speaking of science fiction, I realize you are wildly more well-read than I am, so my suggestion is made in humility. While I can't claim it's good literature in many respects, I found it this to be a fun scifi read: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Avogadro%2520Corp%253A%2520The%2520Singularity%2520Is%2520Closer%2520Than%2520It%2520Appears.html">Avogadro Corp: The Singularity Is Closer Than It Appears</a>. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Anyway, I hope you are doing well. I hope you have the time and inclination to respond and to tell me more about who you are now, how you're doing, and where you are going in life. It's okay if you can't or don't want to (I'm sure you are exceedingly busy). I'm taking a shot in the dark reaching out to you, I realize. I'd like to build a friendship with you. I don't know if you'd make use of a penpal, but I'm here if you change your mind. I'll be openly thinking about you, nonetheless.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">0 : </span> This wiki is hard to describe.
