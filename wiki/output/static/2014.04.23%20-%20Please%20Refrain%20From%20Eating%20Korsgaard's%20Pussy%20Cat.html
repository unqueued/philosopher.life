<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Christine Korsgaard believes we owe respect to certain animals.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> She argues that we share in common with certain animals the morally significant attribute of the awareness of things being good or bad for us, and that when we employ her interpretation of Kantian ethics, this fact results in obligations towards certain animals. The problem I have with her argument is that she has several under-argued or perhaps even unjustified premises. She helps herself to a rich foundation and walks away with a significant claim concerning an obligation to non-persons; however, her argument style only works if you already agreed to her foundation. </p><p>Korsgaard begins by explaining how humans share a history, a story, a context, and certain mental states with other animals.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> Both humans and other animals tend to have some similar needs, experiences, and purposes. Korsgaard channels an Aristotelian teleological account of the good for each species, and perhaps even for each individual specimen.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> Alongside humans, she attributes to a seemingly broad swathe of non-human animals the capacity to experience the world as good or bad for themselves.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> This common experience is vital to her end argument, and she considers it to be a morally significant factor or attribute in determining our duties to other organisms. </p><p>For her, awareness (a term she employs broadly) is something like being conscious of or alert to one‚Äôs telos and the conditions of flourishing specific to oneself ‚Äì what she calls the ‚Äúnatural good.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> Awareness requires that an organism must have a teleological perspective of the world, where aware organisms experience things as being good or bad for themselves.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button>  What she means by the ‚Äúfor‚Äù is not entirely clear, and that is unfortunate, because it is such an important condition in her argument.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> Ultimately, it seems as though she believes we have obligations towards other aware animals because we as humans share with them the experience of things being good or bad for us ‚Äì i.e. they have rights because we all share the phenomenon of possessing a teleological perspective. </p><p>While channeling Aristotle, Korsgaard seems to be either building on top of or offering a new interpretation of Kant‚Äôs arguments (or both). In this paper, she passes off  much of the justificatory work in her argument to her previous interpretations of Kant‚Äôs account, and this makes it difficult to see why we should be convinced by the argument she leaves us. She sees herself as explaining why Kant‚Äôs theory of reciprocal moral relationships between rational humans bears the fruit of our obligations towards (and corresponding rights for) other aware animals.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button></p><p>Korsgaard seems to agree to Kant‚Äôs differentiation between humans and other animals.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button> Unlike the other animals, humans have freedom and reason, and hence we are moral creatures with the ability to legislate moral law.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button> Humans can be morally obligated, but the other animals can‚Äôt. She parts with Kant, however, on what kinds of objects or beings can be the target of obligations. Unlike Kant, Korsgaard believes non-rational, non-moral beings can be rights-bearers, even if they can‚Äôt claim those rights or reciprocate. She claims that participating in this reciprocating community, which only free and reasonable beings can, is not the only way in which one can be owed obligations.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button>
 
The reciprocity theory claims morality is ‚Äúa system in which human beings mutually impose obligations on each other,‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button> where  ‚Äúfor one person to make a claim on another, they must be under common laws that spring from their own shared authority: laws that they make‚Äîthat they autonomously will‚Äîtogether.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">13</sup></button>
 
Korsgaard fleshes this theory out further with the notion of conferring value. She claims, ‚ÄúWhen we take our own concerns to be important and worth doing something about, we take ourselves to be capable of conferring objective value on our ends through rational choice.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">14</sup></button> On Korsgaard‚Äôs interpretation of Kant, valuing is ‚Äúan act of legislation: you make it a law for yourself and everyone else that what is naturally good for you should be taken to be objectively good,‚Äù whereby ‚Äúyou make it a law that every other person must regard it as a good end‚Äîand so as a source of reasons‚Äîthat you should achieve what is naturally good for you.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">15</sup></button> She takes the valuing of our own natural goods to be embedded in this reciprocity theory. She claims that since ‚Äúwe need to have reasons for what we do‚Ä¶ we find those reasons in the things that are naturally good for us,‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">16</sup></button> and we ‚Äútreat what is naturally good for us as normatively and objectively good.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">17</sup></button> She explains that, ‚Äújust by the act of making a rational choice, you confer normative value not only on the end that you choose, but also on yourself.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">18</sup></button> This is part of the crucial move in her argument, since she distinguishes the participants from the targets in the reciprocity process. Korsgaard argues that each human has two selves; one of our selves confers value on the other.</p><p>Korsgaard claims that the autonomous self confers value on the aware-animal self, the self for which things are naturally good.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">19</sup></button> It seems as though there is a two-way (perhaps circular) relationship between each of our dual selves, whereby the natural good perceived by our aware-animals selves is a source of reasons to our autonomous selves to act and be obligated in certain ways, and in the other direction, our autonomous selves confer value on what is naturally good for our aware-animal selves. Further, by conferring value on the natural good for our aware-animal selves, Korsgaard believes we confer value on our aware-animals selves.</p><p>In subjectively conferring value on and respecting both what we perceive to be our natural goods and our aware-animal selves, we legislate that all creatures which have this kind of self and what they perceive to be their natural goods are objectively valuable and worthy of respect for the reciprocating community. Since the other aware animals are beings for whom there is a natural good, like us as humans, and since ‚Äúour legislation is universal,‚Äù then ‚Äúit follows that we will that all animals are to be treated as ends in themselves.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">20</sup></button> The community of autonomous selves together legislate obligations to the selves of all aware-animals. Therefore, Korsgaard believes we are obligated not only to aware humans, but to all aware animals.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">21</sup></button></p><p>The general problem with Korsgaard‚Äôs argument is that she assumes and relies upon a foundation of fairly unintuitive premises which require a significant amount of explanation and justification. First, Korsgaard assumes a schizophrenic view of our identity. Why should we agree that we have multiple selves? It is far more intuitive to think of my self has having multiple parts rather than me being a collection of multiple selves.  Does it hurt her argument to deny multiple selves? Maybe. Her argument looks artificially purer if she can pull apart our rational self from our animal self, since then she has a clean and easy target on which to confer value, and then analogize to the monolithic selves of the other animals. To deny multiple selves, and to accept that our single, whole selves are made up of many parts, may muddle her argument. If I value some part of my self, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean I should value any object which has such a part. She needs to explain and justify this issue further for her overall argument to work.</p><p>Secondly, she seems to ignore what human natural good is really like, and perhaps she has assumed a different understanding of the human good (but didn‚Äôt explain it). Part of our evolutionary story is that we: eat the meat of animals, defend ourselves against and attack other aware animals, and use other creatures as mere means. That may be part of our natural good of humans. To respect my own natural good may require engaging in behavior that prevents me from respecting the other animals in the ways Korsgaard implies. Perhaps very wealthy, modern humans can personally get by without such things, but most humans through history haven‚Äôt and can‚Äôt. Part of the telos of humans is using other animals ‚Äì we have strong evidence to believe so from biology and history. Our natural good is in conflict with the natural good of other animals, and Korsgaard needs to explain how this works in her theory.</p><p>Thirdly, why is awareness or having a perspective of one‚Äôs telos or natural good morally significant and something to be valued in the way Korsgaard describes? Note there is a difference between having a perspective of what is good for you, and having an objectively accurate perspective. An organism could be deeply irrational, having an extremely inaccurate awareness of its natural good or telos, and yet would still qualify.</p><p>Accurate awareness seems useful and interesting, but insufficient for generating strong obligations beyond not causing pain for trivial reasons. I can see some intuitive force behind obligations being generated from the fact that an organism has a natural good, but I don‚Äôt see why the appended condition of awareness matters so much. It is the natural good which has the real force behind it, not awareness. Korsgaard has under-argued a foundational premise to her theory. </p><p>I worry that Korsgaard has unintentionally added this awareness condition because her argument would border on the absurd if she didn‚Äôt. Namely, if we remove the awareness condition, and we simply value that we are the sorts of objects that have a natural good or telos, regardless of awareness, then when we universalize that move, her argument would require that we value all objects which have a natural good or telos. It would result in having obligations to lower animals, plants (which she doesn‚Äôt find plausible), and if we follow Aristotelian reasoning, even inanimate objects like chairs, hammers, and houses (which few, if any, would find plausible).</p><p>Even if she could explain why we should take into consideration how awareness increases our obligations to certain beings, it isn‚Äôt clear that it buys all that much. I reckon the best reason for thinking awareness is a morally significant attribute rests upon consequentialist grounds, but Korsgaard seems to boldly reject that move. She needs to explain why employing an experience machine (like The Matrix) or heavy anesthetics on animals we want to kill or use is a moral problem. She takes herself as having done this, but there isn‚Äôt an argument for it. We might make an argument that such processes impede our moral life (which could be morally wrong), but it doesn‚Äôt seem as though there is a moral life for animals. The condition of awareness may not be sufficient for obligating us to not use animals, by and large. </p><p>Lastly, just because we take or assume or wish something to be objectively good, right, or valuable doesn‚Äôt make it objectively good, right, or valuable. Perhaps she is relying upon previous arguments of her interpretation of Kant to make that move, but I see no reason to think she is allowed to help herself to that claim. Now, we can sneak through the back door and claim that if the authentic self just is conceptually defined as a special flavor of reason (which is what I call begging the question), then what the authenticated ‚Äúwe‚Äù take to be objectively good or right just so happens to be objectively good or right by definition. However, you have to take on faith that we have that reason, that we are constituted that way, that what we take ourselves to really be is like that. That is not satisfactory. People who already agree with the groundwork she takes for granted may be convinced by the rest of her argument. The question, for me at least, is whether or not that groundwork and the rest of her under-argued premises are actually correct.</p><p>As to my own views, I‚Äôm not sure I can offer much. I think we are first and foremost obligated to the moral law (whatever that moral law may be). All claims on us trace their origins to the moral law. It is the fundamental source of normativity; it is the source of all other obligations. Even our obligations to other people are derivatives of our original obligation to the moral law. I also think that if there is a moral law, then it is conceptually independent of the existence of people. The same is true of any obligations we have to other animals. It is our job to figure out the contents of the moral law. Do we have obligations to the other animals? </p><p>Probably. I don‚Äôt know what they are. Virtue theoretic accounts of ‚Äúwhat kind of person should I be‚Äù may offer the most coherent requirements. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be cruel‚Äù entails ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be cruel to animals.‚Äù Beyond that, I just don‚Äôt know. My inabilities in this regard cause me great sympathy for what Korsgaard is trying to accomplish. I want to have solid reasons not to eat my cat or Korsgaard‚Äôs, and so does she. Unfortunately, I think neither of us can put forth a solid theory of why we are obligated to abstain from such behavior.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Korsgaard, Christine M.
