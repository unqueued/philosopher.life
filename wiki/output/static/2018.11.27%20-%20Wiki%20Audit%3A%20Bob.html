Starting with BobEXE (because why deal with the nodejs mess if I don't have to?). </p><ul><li>It breaks the save button (as the git says).</li><li>I see no immediate way to export (dealbreaker), and the .tid files may be different than standard npm TW.</li><li>The bidirectional is ridiculously powerful. It was almost pornographic to see. </li><li>Unfortunately, I hit immediate errors with BobEXE when I tried to just add another child wiki. </li></ul><pre><code>fs.js:663

It's meant to be run on a Windows machine is my bet.</p><hr><pre class="bash hljs"><code>git <span class="hljs-built_in">clone</span> --depth=<span class="hljs-number">1</span> --branch v5.<span class="hljs-number">1.17</span> https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5.git

node ./tiddlywiki.js Wikis/BobWiki  --wsserver</code></pre><p>Like the executable, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Recent.html">Recent</a> doesn't show modifications from the filesystem direction.</p><p>This did not break! =)</p><p>This serves multiple wikis, but it doesn't actually combine them in any way. I think this is a feature others will find more useful than me. Those who spin up a lot of TWs and tailor them to each project will enjoy it quite a bit. My pursuit of unification is the antithesis. I was hoping this did something far more radical in somehow abstracting multiple wikis into one.</p><p>Imported my wiki. How the fuck is 20mb taking that long to parse? Mind you, my browser renders it almost instantly. Perhaps that is a tool that we need to write in Rust? Perhaps I'm missing something stupid obvious here instead. NodeJS is faster, IIRC, but still clunky slow; the browser import was a mistake.</p><p>I am strongly convinced the server should be written in a more performant language. Right now, the single file in my browser is more performant feeling than the Bob server (which is taking up almost a full gig of RAM), likely because of possibly lazy-loading from the SSD. Bob is shredding my CPU via FF too. </p><p>Ugh. That bidirectional hotness tho, amiright? I think a nightly script or built-in TW functions are the still good options here. Obviously, I'd prefer it all internal to TW mechanics. That may not happen.</p><p>Perhaps KeeBoord + i3 + Xonsh + crontab will give me the real fucking hacks here. Why decompile the wiki, xonsh, recompile if I can keep it as is? Well, the latter can do it from pure CLI and doesn't take control of my desktop. I do sleep though! The naming conventions were a problem for Bob; will they be for nodejs by itself? I need to find out.</p><p>Yet, this seems fairly interesting:</p><ul><li>Private Resilio sync for manual Bob directory with scripts?<ul><li>I simply can't accept having my private keys on a public server if I'm thinking straight about it.</li></ul></li><li>Either run Bob or VPN into a server that does</li><li>5-minute compilation on Dallas (because I'd rather not burn a core on it!), sync back, m10 signs and pushes</li><li>Sanitized synchronization scripts into and out of Bob on each device</li></ul><p>If one device gets owned, they all do. I think it would be a mistake to run commands remotely via TW. I need to see what precautions, if any, can be taken.</p><p>You know, I only want to protect m10. I want to be willing to lose everything else. I should just VPN in m10's Bob. Ugh. The problem, of course, is that I don't get to edit offline. That DOES happen.</p><p>Note that Bob does NOT serve encrypted TW correctly. This is a deal breaker for private, but that can be worked around.</p><p>Here's what I like about the Keeboord/Xonsh route: I can use the output of the wiki as it is rendered in the wiki. It can also handle encrypted content (though I don't trust it). But, note, I can use Keeboord and Xonsh with Bob!</p><p>Ugh. Alright, I've got a few different Rube-Goldberg machines in mind here. What would I like?</p><ul><li>Automated config and dotfile backups and editing from the wiki?<ul><li>Only some really...many I don't care enough about.</li></ul></li><li>An overlay tool onto my OS?</li><li>A centralized C&amp;C tool for my devices?</li><li>Music scripting</li><li>Automated tiddler creation</li><li>Automated chat log sanitization and insertion</li><li>HARDCODING!!!!!!!!!!<ul><li>Keeboord+i3+Xonsh is the best short-term hack for this.</li></ul></li><li>Eliminating race conditions!<ul><li>Multi-editing</li></ul></li><li>Sanitized speech-to-text straight into my wiki.<ul><li>Preferably staged.</li></ul></li><li>A truecrypt/veracrypt container that is mounted from the wiki?</li></ul><p>Lowering the friction to automation seems ridiculously valuable. It's hard to even understand what Bob buys me. I can't see that far.</p><p>I am worried that the development environment peeled away from the viewer environment is unacceptable. It's important to me that the readability and searchability of the wiki either identical or favors single-file. </p><p>I also don't like relying upon beta software THIS fucking hard. If I do this, I want to do so based on the assumption there will be days that I edit the single file. Bob needs to be a pleasant-to-have when I have it backend that I cannot expect to have working. The single-file editing and delivery must always take precedence. Bob is a secondary but valuable addition.</p><p>I want to bot my wiki. There are certain parts of the wiki that require you to &quot;push&quot; a button to get working. Why do that? I want to be able to emulate myself being at the wiki where reasonably possible. I want it to write itself. I want to take the work out of the bottable tasks, and I want to be able to tackle tasks which could only be accomplished because I could bot it. I want to be left doing the tasks which only a human can do.</p><p>I am bending over backward to attempt to model my life in a unified container compressed down as far as I can take it. As usual, it's cool to see the feedback loop in how reading, writing, and structuring my wiki affects what I do outside. Unix as fuck: I want to work with text! </p></div>
