<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>In his article, Wellman argues that political states have the right to close their borders. Political states are, he claims, associations of a certain kind, and, as such, can lay claim to the rights given to associations. One of these rights is the freedom of association ‚Äì groups, such as political states, have the right to determine membership, as well as the corollary right to deny membership on certain grounds. (These grounds must be intrinsic to the nature of the group.) Although membership in a political state is non-voluntary, it still holds that the group has the right to freedom of association. If a political state decides to deny membership to immigrants, then, it has the right to close its borders. This does not, however, negate other moral duties the state may have towards outsiders ‚Äì insofar as those duties may be fulfilled without opening the borders, though, the state is perfectly within its rights to keep them closed. In the matter of global poverty, for instance, the state may choose to provide material aid to those in need rather than allowing the unfortunate into the state; when dealing with refugees, likewise, the state may choose to take action to enforce justice in another political state rather than opening the borders for asylum seekers.</p><p>Wellman then looks at and responds to anticipated egalitarian counters to his argument. The egalitarian arguments can be described as either luck-based or relational. ‚ÄúLuck egalitarianism‚Äù holds that persons should not be unduly affected by random matters of chance, such as where one is born ‚Äì when inequalities exist due to matters of chance, the more fortunate individual has the duty to help the less fortunate one. Relational egalitarianism holds that relationships exist between all peoples, and more fortunate individuals are relationally required to correct inequalities between themselves and the less fortunate. Wellman counters egalitarian arguments on two points.</p><p>The first point is that equality, properly understood, does not require us to make sure everyone is not unduly affected by luck; or, at most, it would require states to address inequalities that leave others open to oppressive relationships. While it might be argued that relational egalitarian concerns might trump the right to freedom of association, the same cannot be said for satisfying the concerns of luck egalitarianism, for either individuals or groups. In addition, it is argued that individuals and groups have relational duties that scale according to the strength and closeness of those relationships. Members within a group necessarily have stronger relationships and, therefore, stronger duties to each other than to non-members; the same is true of political states. Any duties that the state may have to outsiders, then, are trumped by its duties to citizens ‚Äì especially the right of self-determination, wherein the group decides how it wishes to be comprised (and who is to be excluded, if it comes to that). Moreover, even this fails to satisfy the real problem ‚Äì the real issue (when discussing the fabulously wealthy nations and the extraordinarily poor ones) is not one of equality, either relationally or due to luck. Rather, wealthy nations should be concerned with the suffering of people simply because they are suffering and their suffering can be alleviated, regardless of any relational concerns. The appropriate response is not some duty to provide equality but a duty of samaritanism ‚Äì a duty to help those in need (perhaps only to the degree to which it does not inconvenience the helper).</p><p>The second point he makes is that, even if states must address inequalities (through redistributive justice, for instance), that does not necessitate opening borders. There may be other tactics to take. Even under the constraints of relational egalitarianism and samaritanism, opening borders is not necessary ‚Äì other means may be taken to deal with issues pertaining to other persons belonging to another state (or at least outside this one that is being discussed). In fact, if another option would serve better, the state would be morally obligated to close ‚Äì not open ‚Äì its borders. If global poverty can be better addressed by sending material aid, then the state should not open its borders ‚Äì it should send aid. This notion also applies to persons fleeing oppressive regimes ‚Äì rather than opening borders to refugees, a state might better serve the oppressed citizens by confronting the oppressive (and therefore illegitimate) regime and bringing justice to that area.</p><p>Abizadeh disagrees with Wellman's stance. The usual understanding of democratic theory is that the political state's right to self-determination and freedom of association leads to closed borders. That leads to tension with liberal concerns, which lead to open borders. Abizadeh argues that democratic theory actually leads to open borders.</p><p>First, a democratic theory of popular sovereignty requires that the coercive exercise of political power be democratically justified to all those over whom it is exercised ‚Äì that is, justification is owed to all those subject to state coercion. Second, the regime of border control of a bounded political community subjects both members and nonmembers to the state‚Äôs coercive exercise of power. Once an attempt is made to cross a border, the state does use coercion against the outsider. Border closure, therefore, does not apply only to the state's citizens ‚Äì in fact, it more directly applies to outsiders, and must, it follows, be justified to would-be immigrants, as well. Therefore, the justification for a particular regime of border control is owed not just to those whom the boundary marks as members, but to nonmembers as well.</p><p>The unbounded demos thesis does not merely support the argument for why democratic theory intrinsically requires that regimes of border control be jointly determined by citizens and foreigners (unless democratically delegated to citizens). It also shows why the most important intrinsic democratic argument‚Äîthe self-determination argument‚Äîfor a polity‚Äôs unilateral right to determine its own regime of border control fails.
