5 HR AGO
I'm actually not sure how to thank you, correctly. It means a lot to me that you care about my relationships. It is very [[Golden Rule]]-oriented to me. I think that kind of work, of bringing people together (go ahead and call me a hippie), is what builds a civilization I respect.
4 HR AGO
I'm glad you all connected as well! I have met so many interesting people and made close unique relationships with them. Only to move to anew job, graduate college (twice), leave my home town ect. I have decided that I will not ever be able to recreate those relationships. But with social media and the interweb. And cell phones. I can have instant conversations with people thousands of miles away. I can continue those relationships. I don't have friends I hang out with everyday. But I have made friends all over the place. I don't want to keep starting over.
3 HR AGO
Sending texts, pictures, videos, photos, conversation teasers, and baiting others into disagreements. I want those people to know that they made real impacts on my life. And we can continue doing that for each other. Positively lifting each other up. And giving advice. Venting and being there to listen.
3 HR AGO
I cant talk abouy Russias role in ww2 and the fallout following it with the guys at work. I can't tak about heavy drug use at an early age, I keep it shallow and light. I'm there for a pay check. But I cherish the friendships I have made... I am on a quest to reconnect. I reconnected with kilcoyn when he was basically wheelchair bound and his dick wasn't working. It was serious. I never made it to visit. But I tried to text or call often to make sure he is OK.
3 HR AGO
Blah. I'm rambling.
3 HR AGO
Nope, you aren't rambling. It's cool to see it.
3 HR AGO
I have discovered that I did make an impact too. Which is a good feeling. You don't want to just fade away. I have always tried to be a positive influence. Even when doing bad shit, lol, I was the guy who called &quot;that's too far or too much&quot;
2 HR AGO
I had a close friend from high school who. Is doing 6 years in federal prison for drug trafficking. Had his sister reach out to me.
2 HR AGO
So I could sign up on the prison website so he could write me letters via email system.
2 HR AGO
Because, he knew and appriciate me that much.
2 HR AGO
Warm and fuzzies yea know?
2 HR AGO
It is excellent to do the right thing, at the the right times, for the right reasons. I love the warm and fuzzies, and I'm especially appreciative when when you do it even without that gratification.
