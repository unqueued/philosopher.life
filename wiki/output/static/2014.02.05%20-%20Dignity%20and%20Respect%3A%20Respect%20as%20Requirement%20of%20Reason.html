Please focus on Audi, Nagel, and the two Kant texts. Dworkin and Korsgaard (read only pp. 119-124) make similar points, but are optional.

Golden Rule Altruism

Shedding yourself personal-persective for a someone-perspective. That is how others view you, after all, and that is how you view others, as a someone. But, wait, he switches to personal on 84.

Primary Task: Discover a foundation for the belief that the reasons he think his needs provide for others to act.??



I fear you are going to rail against the value-talk Nagel gives us on 85. &quot;that in accepting goals or reasons myself I attach objective value to certain circumstances, not just value for myself; similarly when I acknowledge that others have reason to act in their own interests, these must finally be reasons not just for htem, but objective reasons for the goals which they pursue or the acts which they perform.&quot;

I think egoism often isn't so complicated. Deny morality; do what you want do and be as selfish as you want to be (there are no objective reasons to do anything, so why not?). Done.

&quot;The principle underlying altruism will require, in other words, that all reasons be construable as expressing objective rather tha subjective values.&quot; 88

I hear Rawls in this piece.





Nagel's piece was the most interesting of those we read, although I'm not sure how much I have to say about it. I swear I hear Rawls in this piece.

The golden rule strikes me as having something quite right about it. Not elevating yourself above others does seem to be a crucial aspect of figuring out respect/morality. Taking on a perspective where you lose your personal attributes, removing that bias, and thinking of yourself just as someone, does seem to be a step in the right direction. 

As for the gouty toes examples, I want there not just to be merely 'a reason' to remove the heel, but I want that to be an overriding reason, a moral reason, which trumps whatever other so-called reasons one might have (even if they are all objective reasons). 

Lastly, and I hate to harp on this point again and again, but I really don't see exactly how respect (the kind of respect we are really after in this class) and morality are all that different from each other. They seem to be after the same goal, in the same circumstances, about the same objects, etc. Maybe they are just different ways of expressing the same thing. I'm in murky water here.

Respect is just being motivated by, pursuing, and acting in the right way for the right reason(s). If you respect the moral law, then you are motivated by it, you pursue it, and you act according to it. If you respect persons, you are motivated by the moral law, you pursue it, and you act according to it. I fear some kind of circularity here, of course.  </code></pre></div>
