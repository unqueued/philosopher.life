<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>We talked on the phone for a while. This conversation went better than our last (which was really brief). T-Money seems to be doing well for himself.  Works on helicopters. Daughter is 8, enjoying public school more than private from the sounds of it. </p><p>He's softened as a libertarian, marginally less selfish in his politics. Working as a manager opened his eyes some. I can feel that.</p><p>Talked about the Red Tent and recommended Radical Markets to him.</p><p>We talked about Kilcoyne and Berea some. </p><p>It was a light conversation, but I'm not sure we can go much further.</p><p>I thanked him for the &quot;box of contradictions&quot; analogy.</p><p>He spends his time working in his garage, on the house, and even his music is concerned with making money. </p><p>T-Money and I always were able to be cordial with each other even despite some of our profound disagreements. I'm glad to see he hasn't changed in that respect. He sounds very different over the phone these many years later.</p><p>Said he would be interested in Signal. Sent him the invite. Offered to grab audiobooks for him. Happy to do it.</p><hr><pre><code>I picked my daughter up from school on my deere. Cause I'm redneck like that.

 the audiobook copy of Radical Markets (https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Markets-Uprooting-Capitalism-Democracy-ebook/dp/B0773X7RKB) is already in our sync

 the above is our read+write key
1 hour ago
 you can use that key on multiple devices (I do)
1 hour ago
 Signal works on multiple devices nicely as well

 Let me know if you want anything. I'll do my best to get it for you.

 Also, my wiki: https://philosopher.life/ (hold on to your butts)
1 hour ago
 Lol. Thanks man. The beard helps hide the lack of chin! I appreciate the info for the audio books, I am excited to start downloading stuff! I have ran though all my new stuff and been stuck with NPR! I will check out your web page, I have kept some in the past but grew embarrassed and bored. No one has a attention span past 140 characters anymore. It's is difficult to blog and keep and audience.
1 hour ago
 I am glad we have reconnected and I hope to sincerely keep up. There are a small handful of people that I have met and  truly respect and admire. And  you are most certainly one of them.
1 hour ago
 Aye. That's exactly why I reached out to you. I hope my wiki will help you get a picture of who I am, what I'm thinking, etc. It may not be your cup of tea, of course, but it's integral to who I am.
1 hour ago
 also, if you daughter or wife want books, videos, or anything digital, please let me know
1 hour ago
 I will! Very much appreciated! I might be inspired to start one of my own. Most of everything I do is revolved around fixing problems and improving things. Which in my opinion is very cool, but not everyone's cup of tea either. Lol.

 That's the best wiki tool I've found, in case you go that direction.
1 hour ago
 I will have to do some browsing after the sun goes down.

 I'm liking the messenger so far. Not much different than my android provided one. I do like the encryption.
1 hour ago
 Aye. I just replaced my SMS messenger app with Signal on my phone. My circle tends to use it a lot, so it works out that way too. If you have other preferences (including social requirements...I'm autistic, so I'm not the best mindreader), you should let me know.</code></pre></div>
