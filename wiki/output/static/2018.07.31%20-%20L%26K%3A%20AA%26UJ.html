<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>Also, I am considering sending an e-mail to your mother and father; I want to say thank you for the gifts, but I also want to introduce them to my wiki. I want them to get to know me, since I really don't think they do. Is that a bad idea?
3 hours ago
 My worry is that it's not worth my time or would even just be damaging to reveal it.
3 hours ago
 No, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea.
16 minutes ago
 Cool. Do you have advice?
16 minutes ago
 Sorry for the terrible response time. I have a big D&amp;D game on my mind and it‚Äôs been taking up most of my time today. 

Hmmm... other than what you likely already know that (1) they might not read it and (2) they may not answer any questions you have in a way you like.
14 minutes ago
 Read your wiki I mean.
13 minutes ago
 No, it's np. In fact, I'm with you taking a while to consider how to answer the question.
13 minutes ago
 How people react to my wiki is exactly what I hold them accountable for, to be clear. Do you understand the implications here?
12 minutes ago
 This is a T42T (Tit for Two Tats) test.
11 minutes ago
 A Golden Rule practice and expectation.
11 minutes ago
 {Contact} and Find The Others are worth your exploration.
10 minutes ago
 Just in case
10 minutes ago
 I will be completely honest with you and say that, from what I‚Äôve heard, they view you similarly to how your parents do.
9 minutes ago
 Yes. I suspect so.
9 minutes ago
 A lot of their opinion of you right now is informed by them.
9 minutes ago
 This is why I wish to give them a chance.
9 minutes ago
 I will pay laser-like attention to them.
9 minutes ago
 This is why you have a say in this.
8 minutes ago
 You must help me navigate it wisely and kindly. Perhaps it is kindest to say nothing at all.
8 minutes ago
 I also do not wish to make your life any more difficult. I'm not here to have relationship triangles (which are unstable).
8 minutes ago
 This is a choice that may affect both of us and our relationship with each other.
6 minutes ago
 You are a stakeholder and shareholder in my identity.
6 minutes ago
 Hmmmmm
4 minutes ago
 I think I should give you a chance to think about it for a while.
4 minutes ago
 Is that okay?
4 minutes ago
 I am asking for your informed consent.
4 minutes ago
 Yeah, of course!
4 minutes ago
 I really appreciate that.
3 minutes ago
 I think I‚Äôll talk it over with my other half to make sure I‚Äôm not misrepresenting them in my brain while I think about it.
3 minutes ago
 I really appreciate your willingness to empathize with me here. I will do my best to respect your  reason as much as my own.
3 minutes ago
 My gut reaction has no problem with it honestly
3 minutes ago
 I‚Äôm curious to know how they will respond. But I will still definitely think about it.
2 minutes ago
 Your other half is openly part of this conversation. I bunch you two together as a single person very often.
1 minute ago
 I feel like gut reactions are important to consider. Maybe I‚Äôm just strange.
1 minute ago
 No, they are certainly part of the enterprise of good reasoning.
1 minute ago
 Cool.</code></pre></div>
