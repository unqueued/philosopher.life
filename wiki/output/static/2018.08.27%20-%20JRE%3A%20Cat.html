<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My brother cried today with me. That is extremely rare. He is being pushed to the limits. He feels like a bad person, a failure, and like he can't make it right. I don't think he has been immoral, although I agree he has been depressed. His relationship is dying, and he found out today, so is his cat. </p><p>I did my best to listen and to comfort. My brother is not a failure, and I told him that. I have no idea what to say though. I feel his pain, no doubt. It's overwhelming. It's like a slow-motion nightmare unfolding. I really admire my brother's will to be as kind as possible in the midst of it. Sometimes he lacks the self-control he wishes he had, but he conducts himself empathically in other ways that shows enormously mature self-control. </p><p>He brought up how angry he was that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SLT.html">SLT</a> had the audacity to deny his feeling of brokenness. I hear that. I didn't press the point since I didn't want that issue to cloud the problem here. </p><p>I think my brother believes that even if he was on his anti-depressants for decades and committed to doing the foster-dad thing, he would never be able to earn Rebecca's trust again. He doesn't want to do this either. He also doesn't want to permanently rely upon these meds to construct himself.</p><p>I have mixed feelings. I agree that being a dad is an important experience and that eudaimonia is difficult/narrow to achieve without it. I also think he gave fostering a fair shot. I think a lot of children needs parents, but I there are some kinds of redtape which my brother can't be responsible for overcoming, imho. I cannot offer advice here effectively, especially because I'm a failure too often here.</p><p>In the end, even someone as intelligent as Rebecca is going to fail to understand my brother, imho. </p><p>It feels like everything is slowly caving in. I fear for my brother's life! </p></div>
