Thank you for {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="contact.html">contact</a>}ing me. I'm pleased to meet you! Let me know if I can {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="help.html">help</a>} you. </p><p>As usual, the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hyperconversation.html">hyperconversation</a> has become entangled in that my openly writing your letter has led to intermediate discussions which feedback-loop into this letter, and also somehow makes parts of this letter obsolete to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hello h0p3,</p><p>TL;DR: I'm asking for advice on working with knowledge with a tiddlywiki and also working on myself with it. This e-mail contains context that might help you understand what I'm asking. (At least I hope it does :D)
</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate context, though I cannot say I will be of much use to you (I do not know). I'll do my best to think about it with you. I'm hoping that engaging in correspondence may be a useful practice in using and talking about our wikis together. I want to have a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hyperconversation.html">hyperconversation</a> with you over our wikis (you will have to decide your <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> of privacy). I'm increasingly convinced that getting your hands dirty is all-too-necessary for me to pragmatically articulate it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">art</sup></button> There are some dots best connected by you.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Excuse me for the long letter.
</p></blockquote><p>Fear not! =) I think it is a disservice to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> that it is somehow rude to write at length (but, ofc, I would think that).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button> It is unlikely you will flood me with too much of your own writing to read (or at least get some kind of handle of). However, it is possible to write enough that I will not be able to respond to every detail (though <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="IA2DYJ.html">IA2DYJ</a> in how I reason about the whole of our interactions). I aim to be as thorough and personal as I can. I must warn you: I will write for as long as I feel is morally necessary (and sometimes more just because it's fun and I want to be friendly). I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> that won't be bothersome to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bo</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am very much interested in your response, in fact, I've been meaning to contact you about your wiki because it is truly interesting and - in my quest to learn how to use tiddlywiki for my own purposes - I tried to analyze your usage of it many times.
</p></blockquote><p>The methods and reasons for using this wiki continue to evolve for me. If you are general enough in the use of your wiki, I suggest it will evolve with consistency for you as well. That's what philosophy is like, imho. The notion of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">purpose</a> is a crucial one to me; I have strong opinions on the matter. It may be something we should explore. I cannot say I have a satisfactory answer, but I continue to search for the best answer I can give (even if only to myself).</p><p>You don't know how to walk in the desert of your evolving wiki, and I certainly don't know how to walk it for you; I'm barely surviving in the desert myself.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sd</sup></button> That said, I work hard on the rules-of-thumb that matter most. I am working my way to having the right {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Axioms.html">Axioms</a>} to answer your question with whatever viable precision I can muster. I may never get there, homie.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Your use of English is a bit convoluted for me as it is my second language.  I love philosophy (or shall I say I'm a philosophil? :D) but my understanding of it is in its infancy so it is also a barrier for me when I try to understand what you are doing.
</p></blockquote><p>I'm sorry. You are correct: my writing is convoluted (even for excellent native speakers). Don't feel bad about it! I can be skilled in analytical writing, but I'm generally a poor communicator. If you have any questions, let me know. I'll try to give you the best explanation I can. Please blame my lack of skill in our miscommunications on me; I am seriously flawed here. Sometimes I'm forced to speak in my own language (e.g. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hlexicon.html">hlexicon</a>). I wish I knew a better way.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I do not mean to insult you in any way, I admire what you've done and even though I don't know you, I assume I'd be an admirer of your persona as well. That being said, my understanding is that you have a sort of autism (I don't know much about the condition) and it makes you smarter than me in many aspects, in other words, you are operating at a different level than I do - this is why you'd write down four sentences while I'd say &quot;the same thing&quot; in four words and why you'd be more specific (that is to say &quot;more correct&quot; as well) than me, but it makes it hard for me to understand you, even if what you write seems more clear to you this way.
</p></blockquote><p>Don't worry! You haven't insulted me. I cannot say I am smarter than you (I'm developmentally challenged in a number of contexts), but I may think fairly differently than you might (I do not know). Concision and precision are important topics to me.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">i</sup></button> I'm not sure I'm going to be able to solve this problem for you.</p><p>Imho, you should aim to be verbose in your wiki. You have to throw stuff at the wall to see what sticks; <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a> will always be a reminder to me of it. The same goes with spinning up new tiddlers, atomizing content to the correct scope, and relating everything. It may be better to overdo it until you know what's worth crystalizing in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="redpills.html">redpills</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="diamonds.html">diamonds</a>. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This is why I hesitated to contact you - not because I wouldn't want to read your response (I'd love to read you specifically answering what I'm having trouble with and I don't mind that its difficult for me at times to understand it), but there is a chance you've already written down answers to my questions in your wiki but I didn't understand it or didn't get to it yet.
</p></blockquote><p>I talk about how to use and reason about this wiki everywhere. My opinions have changed over time too. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find what you're looking for (this wiki is big). Hopefully, I'll be able to answer your questions in person. I must repeat to you: I don't have any silver-bullet answers for you. I think my wiki is a useful example considering how few examples there are, but you will likely need to figure out for yourself which aspects and mechanics I use work for you. I'm excited to see learn from you in this area as well.</p><p>As we considered before, the snapshots in {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Connect.html">Connect</a>} may be useful to thinking about the evolution of my answers. {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>} continues to morph and merge, as evident in <em>Vault:</em>{<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>}. It's messy, uncrystallized, and I don't have beautiful, simple answers for you that fits all sizes. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But recently I've been interacting with more people and I don't think you'd mind answering some of my questions. I hope you don't.
</p></blockquote><p>It's my pleasure (and my duty) to answer your questions as thoroughly as I can. I'm glad to have the chance to speak with you, nomad.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Now to the body.</p><p>Saying that wiki structure is highly context-dependent doesn't really help, I see why you say that I agree with it, but sadly it doesn't help. (Me. It might help others.)
</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps you already know it. I have studied this concept, and unfortunately, I don't fully understand it myself. I am a Platonic Contextualist (most scholars consider it a heretical view); I mean a lot when I say it's context-dependent. I ask you to keep what I said in mind since it may unfold before you again and again. Perhaps I will have the chance to learn from you in this arena as well. </p><p>Tell me why it doesn't help you. That might give us some doorways to walk through.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>My primary purposes of using tiddlywiki are to learn (everything I can) and to work with information and meaning, perhaps to plan/control my life through it.
</p></blockquote><p><code>/applause</code></p><p>I think TW is a fantastic tool for these purposes. I've never found one better.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ir</sup></button> It will be useful to you to continue fleshing out what you mean by that again and again. Obviously, you can't learn everything, but it seems to me you'll need to ask which things are more relevant to learn than others. Continue to define this purpose for yourself within and in regards to your wiki. Again, imho, the context-dependence problem is going to evolve (and your wiki with it) again and again for you if you use this tool correctly.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I have no idea how to do any of this (with or without using a wiki). This is what I'd like to ask some advice for.
I understand that this is a very personal thing and I'm better off figuring it out myself but advice from someone who has been at it for a while is part of that process (for a hairless monkey like me).
</p></blockquote><p>I cannot say I am successful either (even though I love my wiki). I give you guarded advice here because I consider myself deeply <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> in this practice. I appreciate your humility as well. Let me also point out: I'm constantly failing to take my own advice and I know my advice is flawed. I'm going to tell you what I wish I would have told myself when I first started using my wiki; unfortunately, it is generic advice (but the question is too generic for me to practically give a better answer).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Learning through hardknocks is a valid way to learn, and you are ahead of me in them so I have many things to learn from you. Besides, based on what I've read you seem to be highly intelligent - a quality I find to be very important.</p><p>Assume to have fully committed to the mechanics of tiddlywiki and that you are both smarter and have more knowledge than the person you're talking to (not to mention that you also have more experience):</p><p>I'd like to know if you could devise principles for using tiddlywiki, on working with information and knowledge, on learning in general, and perhaps on behavior change and how to go about that. If you could help me with any of these things I'll be a very happy person. If you can't, you can still make me happy by helping me deal with them: we could formulate some principles for tiddlywiki usage through dialog.
</p></blockquote><p>I think using your wiki well means engaging in philosophical practices well (it's central to finding the &quot;for the sake of which&quot; your wiki teleologically aims). Even with an incredibly strong point of view in philosophy, there remains the problem of how to mechanically use your wiki. While related, they seem like two different angles to what we're doing here.</p><p>As to the philosophical part, I can discuss philosophy with you and make reading suggestions. I'm not sure what you are looking for here. In many cases, you don't fully realize that you don't know what you don't know (I assume the same about myself).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> Don't worry so much what it looks like, and avoid the delicious traps of building gizmos (unless you are just doing it for fun anyway). Function and semantics over form and syntax is the goal. You can make it look sexy, refactor, optimize, and streamline it later. You are prototyping your universe with content (hold the syntactic sugar until you can't); with discipline, don't miss the forest for the trees.</p><p>Start with simple mechanics and master their usage. Make it so you don't even have to think about it. I use links, footnotes, and recently tagging to do most of the work of this wiki. I build a lot of lists, and sometimes I think of the wiki as a highly related set of &quot;just a bunch of text files.&quot; Sometimes there aren't any shortcuts, hacks, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="antipleonasm.html">antipleonasm</a>s to this practice. You just construct and deconstruct over and over again (hence my {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="axiom.html">axiom</a>}: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Deconstruction%2520Obligates%2520Reconstruction.html">Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction</a>). </p><p>Stick to reading and writing as much as you can. Read and write as many hours per day as you can spare, and do it every day. You must lower the friction between you and your wiki through practice as much as possible. Review your work, look for patterns in it, and reconstruct your wiki again and again. Read the web wisely, and don't waste your time on addictive skinnerboxes. Construct reading lists, learn to put books down (avoiding the sunk cost), hyperread and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="deepread.html">deepread</a>. Don't reinvent the wheel. This is really all to say: jump in. Just do it! I don't think my method is for the faint of heart.</p><p>Part of the issue is that I try to unify everything in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="self-dialectic.html">self-dialectic</a>. I'm trying to integrate and constitute myself as best I can. The scope of my practice is huge. Most people build a wiki to do one thing well (and I can appreciate that). The problem is too big to solve with some generic deterministic algorithm. I can't hand it to you because I don't have it. I can guarantee you need to take huge risks in your wiki though. Spin up projects and set them aside. Go make mistakes. Hold nothing back, write it even if it seems stupid or you don't know how it fits. Have sections of your wiki designed for things which you don't understand enough to categorize (e.g. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a>). Have testing grounds and take the time to ask yourself which tiddlers and projects really matter and why. </p><p>Be meta (as far as you can afford).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">meta</sup></button> Read and search your work (and find+use the work of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a> to overcome vice); think about which direction you should go and why. Say it in your wiki! I think the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Review.html">Wiki Review</a> is an all-star log on this wiki, and it is like a backbone meta-tool for me. You'd have to engage in it yourself, and then read and think about them all to see how much impact they've had, imho. Comment your comment's comments. Don't stop digging for the deeper story and connecting new dots. Unfortunately, you have to be practical because you only have so much time. I don't know how to draw these lines for you in your context (or mine!). You need to take a step back from wiki and ask yourself what you're doing and why continuously. However flawed it may be, my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Audit.html">Wiki Audit</a> is yet another profoundly meta practice. That one takes it out of me. I wish you the best of luck, and I am here to think with you.</p><p>Consistently interact with others engaged in work similar to yours. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> and I may be useful companions to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sph</sup></button> I think about how others do things (though perhaps I'm not good at it).</p><p>Ultimately, I can only give you overly general advice at this stage. I'm quite flawed in my practice here. I'm sorry if you think I'm not being more useful to you. I'm doing my best.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I know that making me happy isn't the highest priority for you so if I can have a response from you in four months I'll be grateful for it regardless the time it took. I probably won't advance much in my quest anytime soon.
</p></blockquote><p>I do not yet have a way to explicitly prioritize (if I ever will), but I'm working on it. Thank you for fronting me 4 months to respond; the social capital you credit me is something I hope to use wisely to construct ourselves together. I appreciate your patience. I hope to respond to you more frequently; I want us to know each other. Of course, I aim to be robustly hedged-conservative in how I apply my {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="principles.html">principles</a>}, and I ask you take it for granted that you should feel free to take as long as you wish to respond. </p><p>Crucially, I worry that I will not be able to advance you nearly as far as you're hoping (the desert is infinitely large). I do not consider my skill to be in using or creating the wiki (though I aim for it); I simply spend a lot of time doing my thing in this medium. I wish to be your cheerleader, peer, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="other.html">other</a> in the desert, nomad. I do not know who are you are or who you will be.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I share your wish to have more examples of production wikis to look at but as this is outside of my control, the best I can do is to ask around for thoughts on how to use tw for the purposes I want to use it for.

</p></blockquote><p>I'm hoping our problem will change in time. My (low confidence) hope is that people will learn the value of owning their data but also more freely share it in secure and decentralized contexts. I think our data, especially in something like our wiki, is an extension of our identities. I'm hoping you will join me in being a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Public%2520Self-Modeler.html">Public Self-Modeler</a>. While, of course, not all identities are valid, there remains sacrificial risk in being existentially open with others.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t4</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I don't know why there is no conversation on how to go about using TW in the abstract and not specifically in terms of &quot;what buttons to press&quot; and how it works.

</p></blockquote><p>There aren't a lot of tools like this one. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.10.18%2520-%2520TWGGF%253A%2520TW%2520Competition.html">Emacs and vim</a> seem like cousins. It's going to be hard to find (and round up) a sufficient threshold of people who have committed themselves to the tool (which still has an incredibly steep learning curve, imho) so profoundly that they can and will deeply discuss, in the abstract, how best to even engage in philosophy with the tool. There are too many things to master.</p><p>I suggest that the answers to how to use the TW perfectly have enormous overlap with engaging in philosophical discourse perfectly in our shoes. I can't answer the question well enough.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>To put in your words:</p><p>I hope to develop independent thought in my wiki and I hope to define and achieve my goals with the use of tiddlywiki.
</p></blockquote><p>I have seen this line &quot;independent thought&quot; thought before. I do not mean to press you harder than is necessary, but I want you to think about what this really means to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ah</sup></button> It may be an important contention for us to consider. Freedom is a very hard problem, and it requires faith. I suggest you choose your faith wisely here.</p><p>Very few of my thoughts are really mine.

This makes it self-similar, hence in my analysis of it, I called it - however incorrectly - a fractal-like structure.
</p></blockquote><p>I have to conjecture here. I'm sorry. I don't have solid answers. This is (arguably) educated guesswork.</p><p>I am grateful that you pay attention to my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="APFVD.html">APFVD</a> structure. It's empiricism. Nobody else quite seems convinced of its value, and I may be wrong about it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ym</sup></button> To be clear, only directories have that structure. These are models that can grow themselves and interact with other directories, imho. I see my directories as projects that are agents or nodes competing against and/or cooperating with the others inside my wiki. They are like the federated guardian class of/in my wiki-city which I hope give rise to an emergent philosopher king (currently a shitty jester). I think it is dialectical. I want the cream to rise to the top, and I want to those &quot;agents&quot; to evolve through cooperation.</p><p>As to the visual structure, I cannot say. I've only seen glimpses, and that is all thanks to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>. I find {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Focus.html">Focus</a>} to be the most realistic description of what I find most <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="salient.html">salient</a> in the wiki (that is the goal).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am not sure how far this could go, and I think in your wiki it doesn't go further than 2 &quot;repetitions&quot; but I wonder: does meaning (or information/knowledge) itself have this structure? 
</p></blockquote><p>I think the ultimate source and criterion of meaning is external to me. I believe it is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Infinite.html">The Infinite</a>. I cannot tell you what is outside the cave. </p><p>While I am hard-pressed to find a better example, I think my wiki is an extremely poor representation of the truth about minds and meaning. I suggest the recursion or repition issue is just a function of having only spent 2 years in the wiki. Let me see what it looks like in 20 years, then I might be able to provide a more satisfactory answer (though I doubt it). </p><p>I think there is something non-trivial to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="APFVD.html">APFVD</a> structure. I am still (arrogantly) convinced that the pursuit of knowledge requires leveraging something like it (even if only implicitly), though I do not claim it is complete or optimal. I can say most of my projects <em>do not</em> start out as directories. I have to cultivate them until I realize it. Sometimes they will jump out of me into the wiki as directories from the beginning. I have no rule of thumb. =(</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Can we gain some meta-meaning or meta-knowledge if thought/knowledge/information/etc turns out to be fractal-like? Or maybe we can force the structure on knowledge/thought to have a better way to organize it as you did, but perhaps taking it further. I didn't reach any conclusion here, maybe you can.
</p></blockquote><p>I'm sorry. I simply don't know. You ask the impossible, but one you have the right to ask of me (it's our job to try to figure it out as best we can). If you press me hard, forcing me to conjecture, I suggest <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> appears to a mere <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> mortal like a flat marble slab or maybe a hypersphere. You are asking the flatlander to see all the dimensions here (I can't by definition). All logical truths are logically equivalent, and I do not know where the conjunction of all contingent truths emerges (surely not from itself) other than that unified object of semantic necessity.
