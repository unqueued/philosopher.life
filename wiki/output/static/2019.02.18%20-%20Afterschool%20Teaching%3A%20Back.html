<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Whitney was fine. I am so grateful that Delp has changed his buying habits for food. We are now overflowing. It looks like the inspection mixed with my discussion has been useful. Whitney says it has never been like this.</p><p>The kids are beginning to know what to expect from me. They know I'm going to ask them about their homework, and they know I'm going to expect them to do their homework and read. </p><p>Matt came late as usual. It is obvious he wants me to move on. Lol. I checked the 5th and went to help them because Whitney doesn't help anyone with math. Mitchell and I are the only people who will deal with math problems. </p><p>5TG, as my wife predicted, is an enormous liar. I can't believe 80% of the words that come out of his mouth. He is obviously skilled through experience. He does so without hesitation and all the matching body language. That is a future well-integrated sociopath.</p><p>Matt didn't follow through on his timing claim today. That's okay. I took kids to the computer lab while they took others to the gym. 6DM asked me if it was normal to love his computer and kiss his PS4. That dude gets it. I talked to him about how much I love computers. I think it's a good thing! (Of course, I would!)</p><p>Did my paperwork. Delp's memory is failing him about last week. He claimed Whitney did the Yonanas. Fascinating. I did literally all the setup and first set. I think that is a confabulation on his part.</p><p>We had a meeting afterward in which we discussed how to gussy up the appearance of what we do for the parent-teacher conference time range tomorrow. We were asked to do &quot;something STEM.&quot; Lol. It is all a sham.</p><p>Matt talked about Jung with me. He had a class on it, but he appears to know even less than I do. I appreciate that he tried to reach out to me though! That is really cool (or mere virtue signaling, but I would like to hope it is more than that).</p><p>Matt is changing how he handles the older groups. He wants to allow people who do their work to sleep. Interesting. </p><p>Delp likes to prank and tease by deceiving with an attempted straight face. It's good'ol boy work. I saw it twice today (Whitney called out the second one). The first was a discussion about the book I was reading. The gym teacher in teacher doesn't like reading, and he wants to make fun of the adults who do except insofar as it makes him look bad in front of parents (since it would endanger his job).</p></div>
