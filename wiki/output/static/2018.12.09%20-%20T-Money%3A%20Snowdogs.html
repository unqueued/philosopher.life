6 HR AGO
Staying inside. It snowed. I'm writing letters to a lot of people. Yours is still on the docket (I have not forgotten you ;P). Currently working on a letter to a fellow who sold his startup to FB and worked their for a few years. It's turning out to be an interesting conversation.
6 HR AGO
Working on setting up a large infrastructure for the wiki with my daughter as well.
6 HR AGO
Lots of moving parts to automate and secure.
6 HR AGO
Family Time tonight. I'm excited about that.
6 HR AGO
How about you?
6 HR AGO
Still workin on doghouse in garage. Have to finish enough to put up in a few hours. Bit off a little more than I could accomplish this weekend. Daughter spent weekend with her grandma. Wife gone to pick her up. No snow here. Just freezing rain, now turned rain.
6 HR AGO
Sounds like a pleasant day. =)
6 HR AGO
I'm sure the doghouse will be done soon enough
6 HR AGO
Was around alot of family earlier this month. Both my grandparents, who visited my house in ky, and several other family's said they were proud of me and how good of a man I turned out despite how &quot;chaotic, fucked up, bad, weird&quot; my childhood was. It made me feel good, then feel bad. I have alot of mixed feelings. I can't be who I'd like to be because of mental issues likely steaming from childhood. However, I am proud. Untill I realize I'm just a high functioning addict. I'm conflicted. No response needed. Just expressing something... Odd.
6 HR AGO
We both have addictive personalities. I don't how difficult your childhood was. I can imagine it requires a lot of thinking. Conflicting emotions makes sense to me.
6 HR AGO
Caparatively. To what I see today. I had an absent dad, a mom who worked all the time and drank alot, and a drum mom's boyfriend, then drunk step-dad. Early childhood we had alot of different people who rented out our basement so my momma could make extra $.... She did what she had to and keep sane. I suppose the lack of solid father figure hurt. But my grandpa stepped up. Took me on. Taught me how to hunt, fish, throw a punch/fight. I dunno. Step-dad is a certified genius. But has mental problems. And drinks too much.
6 HR AGO
I'm afraid the appearance of obtaining material possessions give the false advertisement that I'm OK? People associate material gains with success in life
6 HR AGO
We have certainly evolved to make that mistake as a species. I agree with your claim.
6 HR AGO
What do you want in life?
6 HR AGO
And why is that worth having?
6 HR AGO
or pursuing?
6 HR AGO
I think that may be more disturbing than anything.... I've turned down higher paying jobs to less stress and shit... I've got some debt. And alot of toys and cars and shit....
6 HR AGO
Gives the appearance I'm &quot;making&quot; it...
6 HR AGO
What do I want? Sobriety, weight-loss, contentment...
6 HR AGO
Tired of being fat, angry, irritated, and reaching for something to escape the reality.
6 HR AGO
Preach, yo. That's me.
6 HR AGO
I want to help people... Who I can identify with.
6 HR AGO
I hope that is a very broad identity you have in mind.
6 HR AGO
It is easy to create unjustified outgroups.
6 HR AGO
At least in my experience in looking at how I think of others.
6 HR AGO
That said, you gotta draw the line somewhere.
6 HR AGO
Drawing that line is hard work, imho.
6 HR AGO
Yeah. Realistically. I have obligations to make $ and health insurance.
6 HR AGO
I can do my job easily. It has alot of flexibility and it would. Be dumb of me to leave it.
6 HR AGO
Im seeing big changes soon. Self discipline is not my strong suite
6 HR AGO
But I can easily make deadlines and do stuff to make others happy... Like fix helicopters.
6 HR AGO
The 160th unit guys came and spoke to us the other day. Made me feel good to hear them praise our work and how safe they feel because of the specific modifications we make so they can crash and walk away.
6 HR AGO
Money is means. I hear ya.
6 HR AGO
Dude said I can't wait to get into this &quot;new model&quot; and shoot the enemy right in the face.
6 HR AGO
Growing up next to Fort Knox, I have heard that mentality.
6 HR AGO
Lol I know that you find it immoral. But in my head, it's just a bad guy.
6 HR AGO
We are overdue for a real virus.
6 HR AGO
Smallpox gonna make a comeback.
6 HR AGO
There is a truth to the matter. I think it's important to be right about it.
6 HR AGO
We fucked.
6 HR AGO
Something with serious antibiotic resistance probably.
6 HR AGO
Yeah. It's overdue.
6 HR AGO
We need a cleansing. To many people in this world.
5 HR AGO
Who should be cleansed?
5 HR AGO
If I answered: it would be capitalists and reactionaries.
5 HR AGO
7billion people.
5 HR AGO
Need to lose a few billion.
5 HR AGO
I'm volunteering.
5 HR AGO
Hahaha
5 HR AGO
I hear ya. I'm misanthropic to the extent that I think only about 3% of the population deserve to live.
5 HR AGO
I still aim to practice the golden rule with all the rest though. I consider it my moral duty. However rare it may be, some people do in fact change.
5 HR AGO
I am one extreme to the other. Hate every, love everyone. Depends on how high I am and the day.
5 HR AGO
When I'm driving to or from work. I deffininlty hate everyone! Hahahah
5 HR AGO
Yes, lol.
5 HR AGO
Hopefully those audiobooks will be soothing for you.
5 HR AGO
Yes! I started them. Trying to get back into swing of driving 180 miles a day. See lots of wreaks. Co workers wreaking on Interstate and stuff.... Might get an apartment.
5 HR AGO
Hate being away from kid. But by the time I get home I am spent!
5 HR AGO
Aye. I hear that.

5 HR AGO
Gotta insulate. Interior walls and move.
5 HR AGO
Yup. Looks good.
5 HR AGO
Looks like fun too. =)
5 HR AGO
Spoiled ass dogs is what it is.
5 HR AGO
Lol
5 HR AGO
Close friend in Berea got a dui with his kid in the car after he hit a woman head on while driving with no auto insurance.
5 HR AGO
Should pizza'd instead of french-frying, I tell yahwhat.
5 HR AGO
Getting sued by 3 different people, car lost, wonton endangerment felony charge as well as dui.
5 HR AGO
That sucks.
5 HR AGO
Everyone loses.
5 HR AGO
Makes me feel better about my life decisions.
5 HR AGO
Lol
5 HR AGO
He was his HS validictorian.
5 HR AGO
Definitely a complex problem.
5 HR AGO
Got kicked out of Berea College. But never left. Works at the artisan center.
5 HR AGO
Spent two weeks in jail but they gave him his job back.
5 HR AGO
We were ver close when I was in college there. Very similar personalities arrogant, cool, rap music, came from shitty poor ass home. Life... He has so much potential....

Done for the weekend. Excited to get exterior and metal roof next weekend so it will look much better. Will also install some interior walls to keep dogs from digging at the insulation.
46 MIN AGO
Makes sense
46 MIN AGO
It's 1 1/2 stryophom. Works good, not as good as house insulation, but house insulation holds moisture. I wish I knew about it when I redid the camper.
45 MIN AGO
Ah.
45 MIN AGO
I hope you catch up with your letters and have a great week with the kiddos man.
44 MIN AGO
Ah, thanks. You too. =)
44 MIN AGO
I'm over and out till next weekend. Signing off.
44 MIN AGO
Peace.
44 MIN AGO
Peace.
