WED 9:49 PM
I will definitely think and write about my definition of a game in the future!
WED 9:50 PM
and pictures, or more, of my prints :)
WED 9:50 PM
=) yay
WED 9:51 PM
I see your &quot;current obsessions&quot; list is quite long! I'm very interested in your reply to dziggetai (?); a lot of the things he asks are things I ponder about. And of course, take all the time you need -- I'm doing the same with my reply to your letter :sweat_smile:
WED 9:52 PM
It's germinating or fermenting in my head! haha
WED 9:53 PM
I've been thinking about [[Recent]] recently, and IIRC, moving .tid files into the directory might have a poor interaction with it.
WED 9:53 PM
poor interaction?
WED 9:53 PM
I'll have to check later, but .tids added or substituted won't show up in [[Recent]].
WED 9:53 PM
something like that
WED 9:54 PM
Yeah, I'd be interested in having any effective answer for dziggetai. I hate to say: I have no good answer besides &quot;doing it.&quot;
WED 9:54 PM
I take myself to be actively developing an answer for myself.
WED 9:54 PM
&quot;Doing it&quot; is so often the answer to everything, as far as I can tell. Gotta do the thing to get the data to learn/grow/change, rinse and repeat.
WED 9:56 PM
I hope he will join us.
WED 9:57 PM
I'm not doing any adding or substituting .tids, though there maybe something funky happening that I'm not seeing. I did notice I'd get duplicate .tids if I edited a tiddler I'd moved into my shared folder without reloading the wiki in my browser first.
WED 9:57 PM
I hope so too!!
WED 9:57 PM
I'm not sure what's up.
WED 10:01 PM
what sort of funkiness are you noticing?
WED 10:01 PM
Take [[programming]]. That was added to your public wiki today, but shows up for a few days ago in [[Recent]].
WED 10:02 PM
ahhhh, yes
WED 10:02 PM
That's because the last time I edited the tiddler was a couple days ago, but I decided to put it in the symlinked shared folder today -- so the .tid isn't technically changed, it's just now included when I build the index HTML file
WED 10:03 PM
I'm not sure there's a good way to track recently-shared-but-not-recently-edited tiddlers on //sphygm.us
WED 10:05 PM
Aye. I ran into something like it before.
WED 10:05 PM
There are, I believe, 20 recently changed tiddlers since the last image you put up.
WED 10:05 PM
I'm not sure what to do about it either.
WED 10:06 PM
If you know the date of the last run, this might be where the symlinks can be distinguishes. It might be possible to touch them (maybe modifying the mod dates inside the .tids?).
WED 10:07 PM
(The most recent updates were completely by accident, because I totally forgot my web_update script updates the site - I was just running it to test sanitization, then remembered after I went to upload an index.html by hand that it was syncing every time I ran the script :joy:)
WED 10:08 PM
do you have the update tracker extension highlighting changes?
WED 10:11 PM
Aye. It does it for me.
WED 10:11 PM
That may be a tool I eventually build upon.
WED 10:11 PM
RSS doesn't seem like the right answer for my site.
WED 10:11 PM
I might try it out to track your site - often I'll see certain pages in your recent list, but I don't know them well enough to catch the changes - it would be nice to have them highlighted for me!
WED 10:12 PM
Ah, the addon doesn't do that (or I don't think it does). It only shows tiddler titles.
WED 10:13 PM
One thing I could do is a nightly diff-version for just the past day's [[Recent]].
WED 10:14 PM
That might just be a hop, skip, and a jump in TW.
WED 10:14 PM
what would a diff-version look like?
WED 10:17 PM
http://twjam5beta.tiddlyspot.com/
WED 10:18 PM
http://j.d.revisions.tiddlyspot.com/
WED 10:18 PM
I'd want them programmatically stripped out nightly.
WED 10:19 PM
Most of the time, my changes are minute. I think it makes sense to help someone diff without having to do it by hand. Alternatively, I could just script and rip it out with beautifulsoup or something.
WED 10:21 PM
hm, JD's plugin seems the easiest to understand from a reader's perspective -- I have no idea what's going on with the other plugin, lmao.
WED 10:27 PM
I like the minute changes for sure but also a nightly dif version would be sweet.
WED 10:27 PM
Agreed. JDs is the winner.
WED 10:28 PM
What's the difference between live.philosopher.life and philosopher.life? I haven't figured it out.
WED 10:28 PM
=)
WED 10:28 PM
You pay attention to all the details. I love you.
WED 10:28 PM
Okay, so live.philosopher.life is on my Dallas VPS
WED 10:28 PM
it's Mr. Backup and may serve other purposes
WED 10:29 PM
I serve my encrypted TW there and still houses H-book, a TC container, my old images, etc.
WED 10:29 PM
For the giggles, I'm considering serving up a webRTC-based torrent client + music player there too.
WED 10:30 PM
So I can stream my music out of a torrent client embedded in my wiki.
WED 10:31 PM
(and use tagging and [[Search of h0p3]] to build complex playlists, etc.)
WED 10:31 PM
so essentially it's the same site, just served from a different machine? I wasn't sure if one updated more frequently than the other.
WED 10:32 PM
I have //no idea// how that wiki music torrent would work but it sounds badass. :)
WED 10:32 PM
I use resilio sync to push to Dallas
WED 10:33 PM
Dallas will be my full time P2P node.
WED 10:33 PM
pushing to git is way faster
WED 10:33 PM
ahh and git pages is what you use for the main URL, I know that much! :upside_down_face:
WED 10:34 PM
Aye. The performance is just better than what I'm going to be able to do with what I'm willing to spend (and given the services I'm willing to use).
WED 10:35 PM
It's probably going to be important as the wiki balloons up in size.
WED 10:36 PM
makes sense!
WED 10:37 PM
your wiki review title.Tag is exactly how I felt about my wiki review today :joy:
23 MIN AGO
so. many. tiddlers!
23 MIN AGO
Lol, yeah! It's getting out of control.
23 MIN AGO
I know I'm royally behind on all my letters too. There are 10,000 things to do, lol.
19 MIN AGO
Sometimes I hate that feeling more than anything, and sometimes it's the best feeling in the world.
18 MIN AGO
yeah, I get that! :)</code></pre></div>
