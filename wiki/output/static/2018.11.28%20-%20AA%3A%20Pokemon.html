WED 3:37 PM
Might start next week. I won't find out until they tell me.
WED 3:49 PM
It's been a good day. Lecture, reading+writing, shopping.
WED 3:49 PM
How about you?
WED 3:50 PM
Nice!  I think I have a good start on Christmas shopping :blush:
WED 3:50 PM
Otherwise school and book store ... keeps me out of trouble
WED 3:50 PM
Noice. =)
WED 3:51 PM
How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing?
WED 3:51 PM
They are good ‚Äî[[UJ]] is always super busy this season with band concerts he is in and his school program
WED 3:51 PM
Ah. Yeah. My band teachers in KY were always crazy busy people.
WED 3:52 PM
[[AG]] is chugging along in school. She often surprises me how she pieces together information and gets answers. It‚Äôs a good thing.
WED 3:52 PM
Yes he is a crazy man hehe
WED 3:53 PM
Cool. How'd she surprise you today?
WED 3:53 PM
Also, it's neat that you get to teach your own daughter at the private school.
WED 3:53 PM
And I have finally taken up Pok√©mon go since it can communicate with the new switch game
WED 3:54 PM
Does it need GPS on the switch?
WED 3:55 PM
The problems in geometry recently have had a lot of deductive thinking (most of the kids were complaining) She just handed her paper in with no complaints or questions and some of them were difficult.
WED 3:55 PM
I don‚Äôt think so ‚Äîit‚Äôs not exactly the phone game but is similar
WED 3:56 PM
And if I understand correctly you can transfer some Pok√©mon back and forth
WED 3:56 PM
I wish I had you for Geometry. We didn't do a single proof in Mr. Nall's class.
WED 3:58 PM
I haven‚Äôt gotten it yet (Christmas gift) but trying to encourage [[AG]] and keep her from needing it right now...
WED 3:58 PM
Yeah I enjoyed proofs
WED 3:58 PM
Neat about the game. I wonder which pokemon you can transfer and can't (and why).
WED 3:59 PM
I think only the ones from the original game (151) it is based on that
WED 4:00 PM</code></pre></div>
