<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><hr><p>Alright, I'm done with doing chapters. This book stopped needing it.</p><p>I still don't understand the lions. We've spent a fuck ton of time on them, and I don't see why. They seem completely irrelevant to me so far. It's action with no meaning.</p><p>Love the bootstrapping of power storyline of Father. I would suggest that the author has perhaps inadvertently also demonstrated a similar chain of &quot;mastery&quot; among the orphans. Jennifer was the first to be master, just as Father likely first mastered medicine. David and war seem second, etc. </p><p>What is &quot;pure thought&quot; and &quot;reality virus&quot;? Fascinating notions, I am sure.</p><p>WTF is on the bookshelf?</p><p>The species of crazy is odd. It sounds beautifully chaotic, evil, etc. </p><p>As I suspected, Carolyn has the ability to learn the other skills qua her language virtuosity.</p><p>I adore revenge plots. I adore &quot;power-up&quot; Goku shit. I adore training for the final fight. Cleverness, stealth, and learning are hawt. I need to bang Carolyn tonight! Did she start this whole fucking thing!??</p><p>If time doesn't pass for David, he can't be a mind (unless he is transcendent).</p><p>&quot;Not this time&quot; ROFL!</p><p>&quot;Architecture of Thought&quot; - I adore these phrases, btw.</p><p>&quot;The risk in working to be a dangerous person...&quot;</p><p>Hobbesian notion of freedom, Liber, Library. It's a library of power.</p><p>Ineffability of Father</p><p>Why does Father cause that much pain?</p><p>‚ÄúI think perhaps God is angry.‚Äù</p><p>&quot;The vocabulary of such a creature would be different from what I am used to, different from what I know.&quot;</p><p>Why aren't we being told about Carolyn relationship/choice of Steve? Make it obvious please. There is enormous pain and power in this story. Resolve it.</p><p>She is remaking Michael.</p><p>Carolyn-God is impersonal. Steve's argument so far is something to behold.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Normal men, she understood for the first time, burn surprisingly fast. In less than a minute, he was dead. Therein, perhaps, we find God‚Äôs mercy. Beyond that, the outer darkness.
</p></blockquote><p>It's a very moving scene. Why does Carolyn not see it in advance?</p><p>&quot;adopt a stance of compassion‚Äù - Why does she not ultimately understand what it means? How can you be a language master but not understand it?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>‚ÄúSure. Why not? I‚Äôve been in a teaching mood lately.‚Äù He poked the meat with a carved wooden fork. ‚ÄúThe secret is to start with a hot fire, as hot as you can make. Such a fire will burn away impurities, you see. Plus, there‚Äôs a ceremonial aspect to it. Fire gives a person something to focus on.‚Äù He rapped the bull with his knuckles, grinning. ‚ÄúSo, yeah. Fire. That‚Äôs the first step.‚Äù
</p></blockquote><p>That is a powerful line for a woman who was burned alive.</p><p>The eternal suffering of his own son. It's truly poetic.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I must send you into exile, that you may be the coal of her heart. No real thing can be so perfect as memory, and she will need a perfect thing if she is to survive. She will warm herself on the memory of you when there is nothing else, and be sustained.
</p></blockquote><p>You know, when I was a child, my Sunday school teacher asked me who I thought was most like Jesus. I answered, &quot;My dad.&quot; It is a memory that haunts both of us. </p><p>I do not understand why it had to be this way. Father comes back, he has control of time itself. What lesson was there to really learn? I don't get it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the idea that however deeply you understand the universe, however many mysteries you solve, there will always be another, deeper mystery behind it.‚Äù
</p></blockquote><p>G√∂del. Yes. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know, Carolyn. I had faith in you.‚Äù Father‚Äôs eyes twinkled. ‚ÄúYou should probably start getting used to that.‚Äù
</p></blockquote><p>Holy fuck. I did not see that coming! It was so obvious, and wonderful, and sad.</p><p>I've never seen a book mortalize God as effectively as this one.</p><p>Excellent book.</p><p>Epilogue seems irrelevant.</p></div>
