He's planning how to hold himself accountable (and to prove to his sister that he is working).</li></ul></li><li>j3d1h<ul><li>Frustrated by the fact that she couldn't get VirtualBox to work (although Vmware worked), even though nothing seemed wrong otherwise. </li><li>Pleased to finish her journal and format it. </li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>She prepared her Lenten study over the week. No procrastination was nice.</li></ul></li><li>h0p3<ul><li>Made a lot of progress towards getting into the Union. We have good options, which pleases me.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>How are we feeling? (health, emotional, etc.)<ul><li>1uxb0x<ul><li>Sad and happy. Feeling healthy though.</li></ul></li><li>j3d1h<ul><li>Happy. Got a lot accomplished. Healthwise: pretty damn good.</li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>Feels really run down this week. Period. Came fast this time, but hit hard. The vitamins have been much easier on her stomach.</li></ul></li><li>h0p3<ul><li>I've had that fizzy feeling that I had after coming off my SSRI's. I've a drink each day this week, but I had no cannabliss either. I haven't been drunk. I slept quite a bit as well. I skipped DCK this week, and that was probably a mistake according to j3d1h. The lack of Cannabliss didn't seem to affect my affect.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Are you happy? Why or why not?<ul><li>1uxb0x<ul><li>Feeling happy because he has plans for his future. He feels sad about the past week. It's a new week.</li></ul></li><li>j3d1h<ul><li>Happy because she came up with some cool ideas for projects/presents (has to keep them secret). </li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>Indifferent to sleepy. First headache in a while. But, this is to be expected on her period. The weather has been insane this week as well.</li></ul></li><li>h0p3<ul><li>I've felt really angry and cynical this week.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>In what ways did we successfully empathize with ourselves and others this week?<ul><li>1uxb0x<ul><li>Planning for his future this week. Figuring out how he's going to get his work done. He also cleaned his room and did the kitchen quickly.</li></ul></li><li>j3d1h<ul><li>Making muffins for the family. </li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>Planning our long-term future, finances.</li></ul></li><li>h0p3<ul><li>Planning our long-term future, finances.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>In what ways did we fail to empathize with ourselves and others this week?<ul><li>1uxb0x<ul><li>Not doing his homework.</li></ul></li><li>j3d1h<ul><li>Not doing the kitchen quickly.</li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>Did not edit her paper.</li></ul></li><li>h0p3<ul><li>Didn't take DCK.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What will we do this week?<ul><li>1uxb0x<ul><li>Stop himself from playing and being distracted when he should be doing his homework.</li></ul></li><li>j3d1h<ul><li>Trying to finish homework before 4pm and help her brother do the same.</li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>Edit her paper.
