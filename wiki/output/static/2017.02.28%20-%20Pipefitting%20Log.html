<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>New student's name is Chris. He has an associate's degree in electrical+mechanical something (he's a millwright). He can't find a job. He's bitter about it. He doesn't want to be in this class. He just wants to find a job. He has had a class in pipefitting (screw pipe only). He's having to rush through tests, 2-3 a week, to catchup to us. Thankfully, he probably can. He understood the drawings and eventually figured out how to do the math and use our blue book. My teacher said he'll join us tomorrow on the stainless steel x-piece-90 projects. This is excellent news. He's a smart kid (and obviously very self-interested).</p><p>We finished the 5-piece-90. It wasn't pretty. We started the 6-piece-90, and it looked clean as fuck on the cuts. A preliminary grind was quick. We could probably just tack weld it and be done, but I'm going to keep making it clean as I can.</p><p>After lunch, Nash and I were huddled into the class with Chris. We were &quot;reviewing&quot; the basic math we use for screwpipe. The kid didn't know how to use his calculator (neither did I), but once he got the hang of it, he was quick enough. Towards the end, including special offsets, he did better than Nash. Nash is perhaps fucked here. He never does the math by himself. He is always checking the math that I do. That does not bode well for him.</p><p>Chris complained about how long our breaks are and instantly recognized the faults of our teacher (and the reasons for it). I think he is despairing. Obviously, he is interested in doing well at this to get a job. I'm hoping we will work well together. He seems to want to push.</p></div>
