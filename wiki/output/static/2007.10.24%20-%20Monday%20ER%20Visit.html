<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>k0sh3k came and woke me up at about 5 A.M. this Monday and said that she needed help because she was passing out. This, of course, got my attention. I helped k0sh3k to the couch as she explained the problem. k0sh3k had been throwing up all night and was very dehydrated. When I saw her in the light I could see that she was struggling to stay conscious (she was going in and out), and it was then that I became fairly terrified. I‚Äôm surprised she even had the energy to come and get me in the first place. k0sh3k couldn‚Äôt see or talk straight, and so I tried feeding her a banana popsicle (she can usually keep those down) as I called her OBGYN to see if there was any immediate thing I needed to do before we went to the hospital. The OB told me to stop what I was doing and take her straight to the ER. I packed k0sh3k and j3d1h in the car as I called Flint and Kathy because I didn‚Äôt know what we‚Äôd be up against. Seeing your pregnant wife‚Äôs eye‚Äôs roll back into her head (and not just a normal roll because I‚Äôve said something stupid) is a very scary sight.</p><p>We got k0sh3k to the hospital and in the ER in record time. It was difficult to juggle a sleepy j3d1h while walking k0sh3k inside the hospital. I went into the entrance and ask for help. k0sh3k was plopped into a wheelchair and taken straight to the ER as I explain she had been throwing up and was dehyrated to the point of a.) losing her vision, b.) confusion and babbling, and c.) going in and out of consciousness. Because she is 7 months pregnant and there weren‚Äôt too many people in the ER, they took her straight back without triage. At this point, I was asked to move my car out of the no-car/parking zone. I restrapped j3d1h back in the car, parked it, pulled her out, and ran back to see what they‚Äôve done for my wife. Not so fast, I have to get the paper work done *sigh. I do the paperwork and Kathy arrives. We find my wife being pumped with fluids, having blood drawn, and being asked questions. I become relaxed though as I see she is fully conscious and has her vision back. We were out of the danger zone‚Äì I &lt;3 Saline Solution.</p><p>Kathy stayed as until we felt k0sh3k had stabilized enough. Throwing up ‚Äúred‚Äù bile did concern me, but other than that, k0sh3k seemed to be recovering very well. They did an EKG and hooked her up to a bunch of machines and she turned out all right. The baby was fine‚Ä¶still kicking too. We thanked Kathy for coming and said we didn‚Äôt need her to take j3d1h or anything else. I feel bad for calling them when everything went so well at the hospital, but I couldn‚Äôt have known how things would go.</p><p>I made the round of calls on the cell phones. A few hours later Grandma and grandpa M came, but they weren‚Äôt allowed back to see k0sh3k (according to the nurse). They took j3d1h, and I‚Äôm glad they did because I wasn‚Äôt expecting to stay in the ER for as long as we did. Generally, we are only in the actual ER for only two or so hours, but this had already been 4 hours, and we clearly had a long day ahead of us.</p><p>At about 2 P.M. I felt my exhaustion. I had been very sick all weekend too and I was just recovering. I was tired and hungry. Since k0sh3k was fine (just being pumped with fluids and monitored), I felt it was okay to get something to eat. I had brought both cells, so I gave k0sh3k her phone (so she could call me if she needed) and got a Pizza from across the street. This is usually a weird thing to do when you wife is still in the ER, but I had only eaten one meal since Friday and I needed some energy. Cell phones are great.</p><p>k0sh3k layed in nausea on that hard bed for 12 hours as the machine pumped fluid into her. Eventually, they found the right anti-nausea medicine that would actually work and k0sh3k was able to hold down a few ounces of Sprite. This was the ‚Äògood sign‚Äô. k0sh3k and I were happy to go home.</p><p>It has been tons of Gatorade (the blue ice stuff is pretty good), prescription anti-nausea medication, and baby-steps of food for k0sh3k. I think she even had oatmeal this morning.</p></div>
