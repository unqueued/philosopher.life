That shows you love yourself and us enough to talk about your feelings and thoughts. You should continue to talk to yourself and to us about those things which matter most to you and about difficult problems and the pain you are experiencing.

I want to say thank you for bearing through your pain, for finding the motivation to still live in the moment, even when it is painful.
