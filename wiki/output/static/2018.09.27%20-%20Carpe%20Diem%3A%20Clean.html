Brain started hurting, racing and looping, as usual.</li><li>Fireman Time! heals all.</li><li>Got chillun to cleaning</li><li>Read+Write</li><li>Took every book off every shelf, off every table, off the floors, the piano, everywhere. Sorted them again. I took the books I'm convinced we need and put them back on the shelves. My wife has a giant pile for her to sort through. All the knicksknacks have been centralized for sorting as well.<ul><li>Please, my love, I'm begging you...we don't read those anymore! We don't use them, and we aren't going to. Pretty please, with a cherry on top.<ul><li>We have all the access we need through our libraries, ILL, and piracy! </li><li>Look through our reading lists these past couple years.

I ran to the car (soaked within 30 feet), and started rushing to get to her. Still in the parking lot, and she was there. She has a damn good umbrella, and she wasn't soaked. Good! She knew I was coming for her. =)</li><li>She was too tired to fuck or walk. I hear that. She works really hard.</li><li>We laid down and talked for a bit! =)</li><li>We watched a movie: Deadpool 2 (or whatever; does not even merit a search)<ul><li>What a giant pile of shit it was too...The biggest fucking money grab. I just went to sleep while watching it instead. The end credit scene had a good joke in it; it was the only time I laughed. My children enjoyed it quite a bit though, so that's nice.</li><li>I'm glad we watched a movie though. It has been a while.</li></ul></li><li>Chilaquiles + Beer</li><li>C called me; I need to return it. I was too tired to answer.</li><li>Read+Write</li><li>Bed by 11:30 or 1:30?
