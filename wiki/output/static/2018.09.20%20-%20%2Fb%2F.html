<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Alright, so now I need to go back and think about the gorgeous letter you wrote me. There is no way to do it visual justice on my wiki without literally programming it out (and, as you know, I'm a lazy skiddie) or putting it inside code brackets (which is so ugly that it just isn't right). Going for multiple tiddlers seemed to break it up too much (but, I like walls of text). I was caught up in the perplexing meaning too much to say anything about the artistry of it at the time. My brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> and my family thought it looked quite cool. Texture, again, is a good word for it.</p><p>Also, and you know me, I'm always gettin' all up in yo' grill, making it personal: do your IRL friends and family read your site and look at the sites you point to? I'm curious about how they see you through your artwork (which, I can see you wish to set healthy limits on). Again, I'm asking you to select the threads you wish to address ('acks' make it more complicated, I realize). I understand you may be completely uncomfortable answering this question (you are quite tight-lipped, understandably). I try to pay attention to what you say and don't say, including what you reference and what you don't. Like my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Prompted%2520Introspection.html">Prompted Introspection</a>, I feel like some of my questions are prying you open, and I realize you don't want to spill your guts in public (that shit is private, dude).</p><h2 class="">0:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>h0p3</p><blockquote><p>If you sent me your passwords or bank account information, I‚Äôd refuse to post them (and, of course, I don‚Äôt think you should test me on it, but you are free to try, even with fake information [I will reason about why you sent that kind of information outloud]). I think we can construct examples in which I would be truly silent as well, but those are quite farfetched (or so I hope!); you will have to rely upon your own judgment of who I am in such cases.</p></blockquote><p>Let‚Äôs also bring this in:</p><blockquote><p>At last I understood that the way over, or through this dilemma, the unease at writing about ‚Äòpetty personal problems‚Äô was to recognize that nothing is personal, in the sense that it is uniquely one‚Äôs own. Writing about oneself, one is writing about others, since your problems, pains, pleasures, emotions‚Äîand your extraordinary and remarkable ideas‚Äîcan‚Äôt be yours alone.</p><p>‚Äî Doris Lessing, from her Introduction to The Golden Notebook, 1971</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>I adore your quote! I see many things in it. How'd you dig this one up? You are an excellent quote hunter, btw. </p><p>My interpretation of this quote is that &quot;petty personal problems&quot; are things we share in common. We've all stubbed our toe before. I think what really makes them not &quot;yours alone,&quot; however, is when someone else not only connects their experiences of similar problems to yours (since they can never be truly identical), but in fact take your problems to be their problems (qualia being a conceptual barrier we cannot pierce). Perhaps that is the obvious claim here; I do not know.</p><p>In any case, I love the quote. Please forgive me for not seeing how it adds up into everything you've presented. I clearly see how it is connected in my own framework, but I'm not sure what point you are making with it. Ugh, I'm sorry for being so blind.</p><h2 class="">00:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><em>(Okay, time to get everyone else up to speed: I sent h0p3 a private e-mail‚Äîto determine if there was any way of privately communicating with him. I did this partly to satisfy my curiousity: he seems to post every chat log, e-mail and letter he sends‚Äîexcept to immediate family members that have grandfathered-in immunity‚Äîor perhaps he just defaults to <code>public mode</code> unless a kind of formal agreement is established.)</em>
</p></blockquote><p>I do protect my family's names, and they protect mine.</p><p>This wiki is overdetermined. There are multiple sufficient causes for its existence. I write it for many reasons and to solve many problems. Those reasons have evolved since the beginning of this wiki, and I slowly improve my understanding of what I'm trying to build and why. I am glad you point out one of them: this wiki is a mediation device.</p><p>One of the struggles I'm contending with in this wiki is a serious generational familial schism; it resembles, on average, the young vs. the old (some similarities to a component of the crisis society is experiencing at large). We've been ripped in half in the past decade. Unfortunately, there are victims here (including myself) which I must protect and champion. What is said in private to the victims is despicable; the gaslighting is evil. Privately addressing this has failed. I'm going to end this as fairly and openly as I can. I find myself an executive judge at the apex of a crucial conflict (I don't want to be the judge!), and I must show the young what they fight for and why. It's important that I demonstrate I'm clean, honest, and doing my best; it's yet another reason I work so hard to relinquish my privacy. I think every person in power should have to write a wiki like mine. To whom much is given, much is required. Of course, I am certainly not blameless, but I aim to be as blameless as I can and pursue justice.</p><p>I openly hold people accountable here (including you, sir). My hope is that we can resolve this crisis, restore the victims, forgive, and forge peace. If not, we will drive out the snakes with evidence sufficient to meet the requirements of Just War Theory. It is possible that over the next few years, vindication may start getting all Biblical up in here, yo. I'm going to start calling people in front of the moral courtroom to systematically show everyone what they are really made of. Unfortunately, I don't know who all my enemies are (and I may even be wrong about my enemies in crucial ways!).</p><p>My enemies don't write down what they say in private for a reason. Those who wish for peace are going to consistently aim to speak extremely carefully with each other, and their behavior is going to back it up. I do not predict my enemies will have the balls to engage me in the open. If they do, I will unravel those loose-ends, dispel those lies, and force legitimate civility in a public pseudonymized arena. In a sense, I'm generating a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Veil of Ignorance</a> which provides the necessary information to all parties involved. To a large extent, the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="IRL%2520Users.html">IRL Users</a> know (or can guess or find) who is who, while the world will witness these pseudonyms.</p><p>I must publicly demonstrate it to all parties involved as a matter of vindication, to pseudonymously make it public record, and to show that I am playing by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>. Of course, balancing privacy is a complex problem here. This is my current best solution.</p><p>You have said you do not know how you would do this were you in my shoes. This is a shoe you only partially understand. I hope you see the hedge in the immunity. I am trying to carefully lift it in the appropriate places. Even posting logs is fairly new here. You are the first to point it out clearly. Some of my family and friends don't see the public mode as cleanly as you do, imho. Yes, there are a million things that could go wrong here, and I'm almost guaranteed to be making mistakes. I am but one man. There are inescapable conflicts of interests here, yes! There is so much context here that only a handful can really appreciate it. There are a thousand moving parts. If you wish, it's time for you to point out my hypocrisy or lack of opsec here. Go for it, kicks. I will listen carefully.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><em>(I also did this to simply converse privately. Since h0p3 has settled on a dogged insistence on Wikileaking his life, I am unsure how to have a personal relationship in public hypertext with this avatar. He says the avatar is competely, realistically human‚Äîit aspires to be‚Äîand I am finding out if it is. Am I starting from a place of distrust? Well, surely. But that‚Äôs minor. I am suspicious of BOTH of us. We want to believe these pixels are us‚Äîdon‚Äôt we already know they aren‚Äôt?)</em>
</p></blockquote><p>I am glad you test me, sir, even if only out of curiosity. I adore how you are suspicious of us both. The lack of charity here is hard to swallow. The pixel realism modeling avatar problem I have already pointed you to many times. I think it will take you some time to understand what I'm really saying (believe me, it has taken me a very long to understand it myself).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><em>(Because, most importantly, there is you. Isn‚Äôt it awful to address you during a letter to my friend? I steal time spent on answers he wants. I talk about him as a third, which sounds condescending, simply because he is not us. And you could be anyone: an other, likely a reader, an agent.)</em>
</p></blockquote><p>This was a nice touch! I can see you are wrestling. I'm still not always sure how you wield your parentheses (mine go all over the place).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><em>(Maybe it‚Äôs not about us at all. Maybe it‚Äôs about you. Ours is just a performance. And so there is no us, but just you.)</em>
</p></blockquote><p>Okay, so there is something deep going on here. I think you should flesh it out. Perhaps this is obvious to everyone, but I feel like there are a couple interpretations of this claim. </p><h2 class="">000:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Let me start by responding to your brother:</p><blockquote><p>He read the kickscondor letters in full (I didn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôd read it all, which is cool). He pointed to a shift in the tone of the writing. He said we were jerking each other off at first and then got to the meat‚Äôn‚Äôpotatoes. He thinks I‚Äôve been tested in the last section of the last letter. I think he‚Äôs right.</p></blockquote><p>Heheh‚Äîit‚Äôs very true! I think there is a kind of jerking-ones-anothers-off process that has to happen before you‚Äôll honestly read each other‚Äôs words, though. But there‚Äôs no doubt: I‚Äôm the one being tested here.</p><p>You have filled a wiki so deep that I can‚Äôt see the bottom‚Äîand it lands like a monolith; it looks like your beliefs, it is a flashing rainbow conduit. But I am still ripped pieces of paper that blow around in the wind and are lost in wild valleys. I think these things will stay this way.
</p></blockquote><p>I agreed that we must both past each others' tests. You are in fact being tested, but I hope you do not imply I'm not being tested either. </p><p>Yes, Monolith is an excellent word. I apologize that I cannot make it so that the bottom is clear. I work much harder to show it to you than you realize, imho. I will vehemently argue that it does merely look like my beliefs: they are my beliefs. You do not appear to buy the argument. If you wish continually hold this, then it is time for you to start arguing you position more clearly in the dialectic; it is your duty, sir. I'm not playing a mere game with you.</p><p>I must ask you for your explanation of the meaning of ripped pieces of paper yet again. To me, this sounds like a lack of integrity. But, you are not helpless, so what I am to say to such a thing?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Yes and HELLO to your brother! How can I send him a private e-mail? It‚Äôs very important that it be private. It is like when two of my friends meet and later I find them muttering unintelligibly by the bookcase. God‚Äîwhat are they saying?? What if even the Real U.S. Government and Amazon Alexa can‚Äôt seem to make it out??
</p></blockquote><p>I did say hello, over the phone, for you. In fact, I've asked him about contacting you twice now. My brother told me he doesn't want to. He says he is too lazy to create a Protonmail account (he occasionally whitelies to me). I'm not sure what he would say to you (I'm curious though; I assume it would be something humorous). It does feel weird being the proxy here. I apologize for my brother. I also want you to know that it is not my intention to &quot;leave you out&quot; of the conversation. I will relay your messages as best I can.</p><p>Alright, so I am literally autistic, as you know. I cannot always tell when you are joking or not (and, in this vein, I hope you see how literal I am). Forgive me, sir. I ruin what may be your joke, in this case, because I am genuinely not sure (I apologize for misunderstanding what may be an elegant form of humor; I am not your equal). I suggest you imply he isn't real. If so, I adore your suspicion. Yes, I could masquerade as him (if I were obsessive about it, I could make it surprisingly real looking, imho). That's just not who I am, kicks. How far do you think I take this avatar? You &quot;say&quot; this regarding both my wife and my brother, and I love you for it.</p><p>If this isn't humor and you have an actual point here, then legitimately wrestle rather than taunt. I know you don't want to wrestle, but you sure have the rhetoric of one who does. </p><h2 class="">0000:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><blockquote><p>I am going to publicly think about you, who you are, how you think, what you say, and what you do. Do you wish to be so open and honest? Do you really want to interact and be in contact with me? In this context, informed consent is your responsibility. Do not let my honesty become your enemy. You do not have to wrestle with me, but I hope you see I‚Äôm actually trying to radically cooperate with Humanity. How will you treat this naked madman in the desert?</p></blockquote><p><em>(This bit is not from the letter I am replying to, but from Contact h0p3. I‚Äôm not sure I read the whole thing previously, but his rules of engagement are clearly spelled out. Please read this if you intend to strike up a conversation. I wonder if we could all use a page like this‚Äîsomehow I can‚Äôt see myself doing this, as it feels in close proximity to a sign my neighbor has on her door: ‚ÄúDO NOT BRING DRUGS, ALCOHOL OR ANY ILLEGAL MATERIALS OR SUBSTANCES INTO THIS HOME!!‚Äù Such a note has the fragrance of a previous encounter all over it; there is a distinct banishment of the ‚Äúyou do you‚Äù from 2018‚Äîwhich may not actually exist.)</em>
</p></blockquote><p>I actually don't think I should have to even spell this out; I do so, in part, as a courtesy.</p><p>I can see who you compare me to. I've been raised around the type. Are you sure you mean this comparison still?</p><p>You must have a good point here because I've missed it. C'mon, you do appear to be either trolling here (I LOVE YOUR ALL CAPS, BTW), or you have a serious disagreement that you don't know how to voice. You see how I think this letter is begging to wrestle, right? You continually appear to contradict yourself on this point on the wrestling issue. You border on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> failure, even in your new letter. I swallow your inconsistency because my weighing deems it necessary.</p><p>It sounds like you are asking me if I can smellalalalalalalla what The Rock is cooking. If you think I've been irrational or immoral, then point it out clearly and put it to the test. I legitimately aim to fix my mistakes. Yes, I am an arrogant-appearing sonofabitch.</p><h2 class="">001:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>And what‚Äôs more: you have no idea whether I talk of you. Whether you get zero conversation hits or thousands. What I have read of yours. How I react to it‚Äîwhat I really think of you. (Do I know what I really think of you? Do I know when I‚Äôve conversed about you?) How would it be helpful for either of us to know these things? And, worse, to know them forever.
</p></blockquote><p>This is such a provocative line. What purpose does this argument serve?</p><p>To be crystal clear: I do not lie to you, sir. I'm not playing some <em>mere</em> game with you, sir. And, I beg you not to play a mere game with either of us. <em>This is real</em>. You seem to imply this is simulation and mere avatar (and now, I am yet again unsure if you mean what you say: surely you cannot!). Must I take you task? What do you need from me, sir? Do you need to me reach out into the world beyond this wiki to show you our relationship is real? I cannot shake you awake in this desert, and I do not know why.</p><p>When I address my letters to you, they are literally to you, sir. <code>Do you hear me, Kickscondor?</code> I'm talking to the one and only <em>you</em>.</p><p>There are ~6,000 tiddlers in this wiki, and 5 of them are addressed to you. Of course, I can speak to 3rd parties in my open letters to you, but I really am trying to be clear about it. It's not like I'm unaware of this consideration, and I attempt to leave plenty of evidence. I hope you don't think I'm being rude on this point either. Forgive me for my failures here. Of course, I am <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a>. Show me what to fix, and I will try to fix it. I appreciate your willingness to help me, sir.</p><p>I am never absolutely certain that you are talking to me (and vv). I can only assume and infer at some level. I suggest that real life conversations actually pose the exact same problem, and you are in no position to deny it (even though the odds are probably higher). It is a matter of empirical modeling, and you will never escape the skepticism of the external world, the problem of other minds, and plenty of social-contextual considerations.</p><p>I don't know why it matters if I have zero conversation hits or thousand with respect to this paragraph. In fact, I'm worried you don't really want all my answers to these questions. Forgive me for misunderstanding you. Are you sure this is where you want to go in the dialectic? Yes, I don't know if you direct these words at me, but it's reasonable to think you do. Do you really wish to wrestle with me? </p><p>Surely, I must be interpreting you incorrectly. Reading this yet again, I see mixed messages. Forgive me for being a poor interpreter of you, sir. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Picture two computers scanning each other ports. These two daemons find each other and swap drive contents, RAM, video card states. Then they blink: blue, blinking red or bright white. They understand each other!</p><p>But what does it matter? Perhaps they can part ways now‚Äîthere is no more data to exchange.
</p></blockquote><p>/literal-applause. Bah, you cannot say you aren't wrestling. I am duty bound to take you task on it. Look at that gorgeous example you give us.</p><p>Oh, yes. Like every other finite creature, I'm lost trying to answer this question too: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Ship of Theseus</a>. You have given us a more sophisticated version. I adore the picture you paint. This is casuistry. You suggest they are identical algorithms at the end of the &quot;swap,&quot; right? Don't tell me you aren't an intellectual (false humility!), sir. This is a Parfitian problem for agency. Here's another way to say it (I believe you already know this one too):</p><p>Imagine you are being beamed to Mars with a Star Trek transporter. The complete atomic configuration of you materializes on Mars, but there is an error or lag in dematerializing you here on Earth. For a few minutes before you dematerialize, you interact with a video feed of &quot;you&quot; on Mars. Are you identical? Is the Mars agent &quot;you?&quot; </p><p>I suggest our perspectives and individual contexts can never be irreducibly identical (even if we resort to qualia), except insofar as we fit into an objective picture.</p><p>We should only be so lucky as humans to be in a position to silently know each other so perfectly. Do you understand what empathy really means?</p><h2 class="">0010:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><blockquote><p>I must ask: do you simply FO desire to encourage me, or do you SO desire to FO desire to encourage me? The difference matters. There is a tension in this letter I‚Äôve not been able to peel apart.</p></blockquote><p>Boy, I don‚Äôt know yet. I like to think it‚Äôs way down‚Äîlike zed order enouragement.</p><p>I think this only happens out of motivations like idle curiosity, amusement and meandering conversation. Which is to say: the greatest, most noble pursuits I can imagine. Convincing you IS NOTHING compared to these treasures!!</p><p>I hope to find: not truth, not love, not happiness, not even meaning‚Äîbut ‚Äòfire‚Äô.
</p></blockquote><p>THIS IS FUCKING GARBAGE. If he literally means these words, he is a snake. It's insane. The contradictions keep piling up. It's straight up evil. If there is any hope for this man, it cannot be in this last line. This letter was a giant redflag. I should never have even tried to respond to the thing. Wake up, h0p3... This is an obvious <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> failure. I'm frustrated. The other letters are the counterweight evidence, and that is what I should focus on.</p><p>Kicks is trying. He might not know what he wants or means to say. People change, and people make mistakes in the dialectic. It's time to set this aside and try again.</p></div>
