<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I talked to Chris about ethics in the car on the way. Of course, I have what are considered outlandish views to most people. Perhaps I shouldn't reveal myself. It is rarely worth it. Is it worth it overall? What strategy is fitting? Be utilitarian about it.</p><p>In any case, it is colder today. I can see it is going to get very fucking cold out here in the winter. I will need to buy gear for that.</p><p>Dave told us we need to be more active, but that we are doing a good job. Lots of doubletalk and contradictions in his speech this morning. It is clear he is feeling pressure from his bosses to be more productive, but he fails to give us jobs to actually do, to line up work, etc. I think this is a bit odd. Several times, he has mentioned his worry about getting shitcanned here and there.</p><p>Chris-M and I worked on the PVC pipe (John was a glorified helper). Our old drawing from yesterday (which I never got to see) wasn't going to work because the fittings weren't sized as anticipated. We are stovepiping though, so not a big deal. We went to remeasure what it was going to look like, and I saw that our run was going to hit some pipes. I convinced Chris-M this was the case, and he decided to change up how we were doing the run.</p><p>It is very much like socket welds. You scuff the areas to be glued, use a primer to soften it up, and then glue. You put it on and twist. Let the stuff sit for a bit, and wipe off the edges for aesthetics. The TOs and &quot;Stick-ins&quot; of the sockets must be measured for every set of fittings you get (there is huge variation, apparently). </p><p>Chris-M had to get something, and I figured out the math and drew our lines up for cutting. He asked what I was doing. I explained, and he saw I was right. He said to carry on. On our next leg, I explained how long I thought it should be (since he said something different than I thought), and he realized I was right (and had the integrity to just say, &quot;you are right&quot;). I am learning a fuckton today. I love it.</p><p>PVC is messy, simple, and with practice would be very fast. It is quite uncommon for fitters to work with it, but we just needed to reroute a drainage pipe, and this is the cheapest option. Chris-M has a very good notion of the order of the fitup construction order (out of order, but the right out of order). I hope I can acquire this skill in time.</p><p>I thanked Chris-M for teaching me how to do PVC. I'm learning so much.</p><p>Break!</p><p>We constructed most of the spool  (I always try to insert my idea, notion, plan first [which is what we end up doing usually] to get practice and feedback). We can't use a 45 at the top (which is what you should use for drain pipes, but we can't at the top, not without splitting the Y above it [we don't have enough space]). Chris-M decided to let me take over, and he is going to be my helper instead. That is very trusting of him, and I appreciate that he is willing to let me learn.</p><p>I talked to John quite a bit about the industry, about welding, and his recommendations for moving on up. He doesn't think I should weld. He likes to make fun of my penchant for taking him so literally. John said not to try the P.O. Box trick on this job, but perhaps for the next one. I may end up using my brother's address. That per diem is huge.</p><p>Apparently, Chris-M is called professor sometimes. I can see that. He is intelligent (although, he calls himself stupid often enough). I asked if that was a bad thing, and he and John just said it was a sarcastic comment. Obviously, they might be horrified by who I am.</p><p>Lunch!</p><p>Chris (Chris-R) thinks we are taking much longer than we need to. He also thinks we are using too much glue.</p><p>We finished up the PVC pipe, and we cut the drain pipe. It wasn't easy to get the drain pipe since there was tons of conduit and other no-nos in the way. I had to be very careful with multiple tools to do it. John did the climbing like a spider to fit it into place. It wasn't easy, but it fit. </p><p>Unfortunately, despite missing some pipe, we didn't avoid others. Our planning still wasn't good enough (Chris-M said that was the nature of stovepiping rather than absolute planning). I think we should have drawn the iso up and done it completely right. Eh, whatever, it worked.</p><p>I need to think carefully about how skilled the people around me really are. Just because they are more knowledgeable and experienced doesn't mean they really are better at thinking about every single aspect of the project. </p><p>Found out Dave's son really will be joining us next week Monday. This will be interesting. I assume it will be perma-birddog hell for us. Time to kiss some serious ass.</p><p>Break!</p><p>We cleaned up and then started dropping some chalk marks from the 30&quot; elbows to the header. Done.</p></div>
