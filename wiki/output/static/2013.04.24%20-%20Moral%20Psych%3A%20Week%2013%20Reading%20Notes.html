<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Bayne on Wegner: 2 components</p><p>1st: “we experience conscious will with respect to an action when we have an introspective preview of it.”1 Where actions are caused by our thoughts, just before those actions, consistent with those actions, and without other potential causes. MATCHING MODEL of the experience of conscious will.</p><p>2nd: Conscious will is an illusion. “experience of conscious will misrepresents the causal path by means of which one’s own actions are generated. “</p><p>Bayne’s interpretation of Wegner: 1st component is evidence for the 2nd. Bayne thinks this is mistaken. “The matching model might explain why people experience a sense of agency, but it does not show that this sense of agency is an illusion.”</p><p>Bayne distinguishes “experience of conscious will” and “will itself,” where one is appearance and the other the thing in itself. Bayne is worried about Wegner’s claim that “will is a feeling,” as it might collapse the distinction. How and why?</p><p>Bayne points out ambiguities in the possible relationships between experience of the will as: authorship, intentionality, effort, freewill, and mental causation. Are they synonyms? Why should we think they are? It seems difficult to break them apart.</p><p>“At any rate, the experience of will does not seem to involve an experience of one’s intentions compelling one’s actions.” Really? This isn’t so clear.</p><p>Authorship does seem to peel apart from actually willing a bit. The feeling of authorship seems like it must it can come at the same time as willing, but also continues after willing, possibly.</p><p>It is very unclear to me in that “Penfield actions” have an author, as we mean it here, at all. It certainly isn’t the patient, and at best it would be the Penfield himself, but it lacks the sort of experience necessary to call it authorship, I think. What does Wegner get by believing that “it is possible to author an action without experiencing oneself as authoring it (ICW: 47)”?</p><p>When is the experience of conscious will veridical? Even demonstrating that it is often not veridical is a problem for the proponent of free agency, even if it isn’t a knock-down argument. It introduces oddities, complications, and lots of worries. Free agency might survive, but it will be deformed, abnormal, ambiguous, and unclear. What are those?</p><p>On the section distinguishing “willed action” (controlled, voluntary) and “unwilled action” (automatic), which rests upon whether or not an action derives “from the agent’s plans and goals and those actions that are stimulus-driven,” Bayne seems to worry that Wegner “is using ‘the experience of conscious will’ to refer to an experience of the target action as willed rather than automatic.” Bayne thinks Wegner counters his own work by “the claim that the experience of conscious will is an illusion would amount to the claim that there are no willed (plan-driven) actions - all actions are automatic.” I don’t see why. Assuming the matching model is evidence for illusion-claim, this does seem to be natural conclusion to draw, and it is the ultimate problem being raised by Wegner, right?</p><p>“There are three questions that can be raised here. (1) What kind of thoughts are involved in generating the experience of will? (2) What kind of consistency is needed between the target thoughts and the target actions? (3) How is the presence of “other potential causes of the action” incorporated into the model?”</p><p>What kind of thoughts are involved in generating the experience of will?</p><p>Thoughts may be personal or subpersonal; Wegner’s model is at the personal level.</p><p>Chloe example. I don’t think we should see her “movements as caused by (and realizing) [her] intentions”in any direct sense. There wasn’t a match between one’s intentions and one’s movements in this case. There is matching on Bayne’s definition, but his definition somehow fails to really capture what we mean. That matching needs to be more direct, and that is what I think Wegner was going after.</p><p>Bayne refers to “unconscious intentions” in a footnote 8. What are those? Does they even make sense?</p><p>On the 2nd component: conscious will is an illusion:</p><p>We experience our actions as caused by consciousness, but this experience is non-veridical (misleading)</p><p>We have a mistaken model of how experiences of conscious will are generated: we think that they are based on direct perception of their objects, but they are in fact theoretically-mediated</p><p>Experiences of conscious will are frequently non-veridical. I will examine all three claims. The first two can be dealt with fairly quickly; the third will prove more troublesome.</p><p>“Do we believe that our own actions are caused by consciousness?...consciousness of what?... Wegner appears to have consciousness of agency in mind.” Does he? “[D]o we believe that the experience of consciously willing an action causes the movement (or action) that is the target of that experience?”</p><p>It isn’t clear to me that this question is a bad one. The experience of consciously willing seems to be nested inside conscious willing itself. This isn’t like the perception of the color blue. Experiencing blueness is not a part of blueness; experience conscious willing does seem to be a part of conscious willing. I worry that Wegner’s case may be stronger than it initially seems. Maybe it isn’t the SOLE cause, but surely it be part of the cause. He later brings this up.</p><p>False comparison between sensory perception and perception of consciousness. The comparison is fair in that even if we call certain sensory perception “partially illusory,” we don’t throw out sensory perception entirely – it is veridical to some extent, and that’s better than nothing. Likewise, even the experience of conscious willing is partially nonveridical, we don’t have to throw it all away. Except, I’m worried about the nesting problem. It is part of itself…</p><p>Despite being well structured, I’m afraid I didn’t follow Bayne’s arguments very well. Either I failed to understand them outright (a real possibility) or I didn’t find them to have the same force that he seems to think they have.</p><p>“The rejection of direct indication views of visual perception has not led theorists to reject visual experiences as illusory, nor should it have.” As partially illusory, YES!! Hearing is a perfect example. Our mind “fills in the gaps” between sounds. It makes us hear things that aren’t there, and it makes us hear things not as they really are, but as we anticipate them or need them to be. Appearances are deceiving and illusory to some extent.</p><p>The Dissocation Argument</p><p>Illusions of control, Illusions of action projection</p><p>“Inductive generalization: since some experiences of conscious will are non-veridical it is reasonable to infer that most, and perhaps even all, such experiences are.”</p><p>Shows fallibility, but not unreliability. What happens if unreliability can be shown? How can that be shown? How unreliable is too unreliable?</p><p>Reliabilism.</p><p>inference to the best explanation: “Since the phenomenology of agency plays no direct role in the genesis of action where such experiences are absent, we have good reason to think that it plays no direct role in the genesis of action when such experiences are present.” Aren’t these weird cases though?</p><p>“To the extent that automatisms are action-generation procedures that do not involve intentional states of any kind then there may be a tension between automaticity and the experience of conscious will, but Wegner provides little evidence for the view that our actions are usually automatistic in this sense of the term. If, on the other hand, automatisms are action-generating procedures that are non-consciously initiated then there is ample reason to describe much of what we do as automatic in nature. But on this conception of an automatism there is, I claim, no conflict between automaticity and the feeling of doing. So there is no argument from automaticity (thus conceived) to the claim that the experience of conscious will is an illusion.”</p><p>Eliminativism: too many problems with the theory for anything coherent to come out; we should abandon the project; there isn’t a truth to the matter (different from skepticism, which claims falsehood) or we simply can’t get at the truth of the matter.</p><p>“explanatory exclusion: lower levels of explanation exclude (eliminate) higher levels of explanation.”</p><p>Reduction problem.</p><p>Bayne claims: “the logical relationship between experiencing oneself as willing something and actually willing it is akin to the relationship between, say, experiencing something as being blue and it actually being blue. The experience is one thing, the property or object experienced is another.” In keeping with this analogy, he argues: “The rejection of direct indication views of visual perception has not led theorists to reject visual experiences as illusory, nor should it have.”</p><p>The latter argument moves too fast. As far as I know, sense perception is partially illusory. Auditory perception is a perfect example. Our brain “fills in the gaps” between sounds that our ears pick up. It makes us hear things that aren’t there, and it makes us hear things not as they really are, but as we anticipate them or need them to be. Appearances are deceiving, and we do experience a distorted version of reality. Our auditory experience is partially illusory (which obviously does not make a sound wave truly epiphenomenal). We are deceived and fallible, and it seems sense perception may be analogous to our experience of conscious will in this respect.</p><p>But, the analogy isn’t so clear as far as I can tell. First, even if sensory perception was completely illusory, we would not be in a position to claim that sounds waves necessarily do not exist. We just wouldn’t know.</p><p>we would not even remotely consider the possibility that sense perception is</p><p>Whereas experiencing blueness is not necessary for blueness, experience of conscious will does seem to be necessary for a conscious will. Right? Should we agree that the experience of sense perception is so analogous to the experience of conscious will?</p><p>Mele</p><p>Perhaps people are struggling with the belief they are controlling the mouse and the opposite, the belief the aren’t. Weird things might result from such a struggle. Seriously, it isn’t everyday that someone asks you, “Do you feel like you were in control of X? Did you experience conscious will in case Y?,” etc.</p><p>1 2
