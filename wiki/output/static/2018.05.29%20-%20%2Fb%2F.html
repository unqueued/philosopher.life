<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My wife said something interesting to me last night. She felt like she is Dr. Watson (and not just because she has adored this classic story for ~35 years). She said that she feels like she trustingly follows me around, not always knowing where I'm going or why. She's convinced her investment in me is worth her time. Part of me is flattered, and part of me is horrified. It is absolutely crucial that I do my part to maximize her autonomy in directing our lives together. I feel like I must be failing her.</p><p>I have said it to her many times, I feel like she is my interpreter. She's literally the only other human alive that can read this wiki and understand 95% of it with the same intension, inflection, connotation, gutteral-somethingness, and narrative-appreciation that she does (and for good reason). Her affective and cognitive empathy is powerful to me. I think this is part of why we have a profound sympatico that I do not find in any other couples I've met (mind you, my autistically developed theories of mind may nix my claim here outright). Sometimes, I feed her the narrative I see/generate. I do love &quot;giving it to her.&quot;</p><p>She is a verbal genius, demonstrably. Perfect verbal IQ scores without studying is nothing to sneeze at. She is, in fact, verbally more talented than I am quantitatively on the bellcurve. This is what strikes me so odd about the Dr. Watson comment. Is this a matter of executive functioning? Is it simply the fact that I try harder, or that I get more support in my endeavors than she does in hers? How can I help my wife become who she wants to be, to use her talents like the verbal goddess she is. </p><p>I will admit, her verbal skills appear much stronger in her ability to read and interpret than to create and write her own. But, is that because she simply doesn't practice enough? What am I missing in this puzzle? How can I help her?</p><p>She reads YA fiction. She doesn't push herself anymore. Why? Is it taking every ounce of effort for sustain our family, to the point that she can't afford to push herself like this? Is she the one holding the rest of our heads above water at the expense of her own life? I am horrified by my allowing her to sacrifice herself in this way; I should be throwing myself underneath all of us.</p></div>
