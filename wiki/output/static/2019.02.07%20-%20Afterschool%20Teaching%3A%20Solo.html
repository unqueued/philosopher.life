<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I was the only person, period. Lol. I had resigned myself to running the office and managing all 4 grades at the same time. I can do that, but it requires keeping everyone contained in the cafeteria. Just as I was about to announce my plans, I saw Mitchell show up. He was in a meeting. Cool.</p><p>I took everyone to Baines' room, and some of the 8th graders kept back in the cafeteria with 9Tm staying with them (their preference, obviously). </p><p>Figured out why Baines is so reasonable: she's new. She was the math teacher replacement. Ah, that bright-eyed idealism. I still admire it. That's ultimately at the heart of my skepticism; reality doesn't match up to what I know it could possibly be.</p><p>Whitney came in late. Dentist appointment. Sonya also showed up. It's a good thing everything looked tidy and people were doing their work. </p><p>I do not inspire people, and I'm not a fun teacher. I don't hand out the answers or play games, I don't coddle, and I don't value most of what they identify with. Further, I'm just not extroverted in the standard sense, and that is entirely what is rewarded. These poor kids, lol. I think the 5th-grade boys especially hate me, but tough titties. I want you to get your homework done kid! Some of these are on the edge of outright failing. </p><p>I guess part of the problem is that I think an &quot;A&quot; just isn't enough. Who gives a shit about the approval of this institution as it is? I get why people can have a reason to hate school, but these kids hate learning. They are boned. I will continue to calmly present my perspective with the prediction that few will ultimately take me up on it. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Hope.html">Hope</a> is slim.</p><p>5NP2, 5BG, and 5LL were little shits today, as usual. 5LL's mom is more openly recognizing that her son lies to everyone including her. Of course, it is our fault. =) </p><p>Lots of people out and sick still.</p><p>By playtime, it was a madhouse. We were locked out of the gym, fields outside, and the lab. They were all in use. That relegated us to the library and some kids wanted to paint. I took them to Baines' since I'm not going to fuck the carpet up. It was wonderful to have the kids paint. I like watching my kids make art too. They used the smartboard to make art as well. 8Gf and I had an in-depth conversation about social media. She has the right instincts that one does; she just can't articulate the principles which match them. Clever girl. I'm going to empower her with all the weapons she needs if I can.</p><p>I've been prying into their lives about their computer usage. Precious few have a computer, some don't care, but the smart ones wish they had a computer at home. Those who come with me to the computer lab on the regular are the most likely. I must teach my children hao2geek.</p><p>It's interesting to see that many of the kids know I'm listening and let particular things fly. I give them a blankly amused or inquisitive look in some contexts. The oldest kids, however, are actively more secretive in general. Makes sense.</p><p>I continue to give the &quot;according to what I've been told, these are the school rules&quot; whenever I'm asked for permission to use the internet. Many have realized I don't give a shit, or they don't give a shit if I do, and both are fine with me.</p><p>I saw Mitchell play the field today against parents. Aye. I can see how that helped him acquire his position</p></div>
