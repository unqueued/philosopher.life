<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Ask, and ye shall receive. Today, my teacher threw me a curveball and I struck out (although, I thankfully didn't land on my ass). He told me he purposely designed it to fool me, and it did (I'm glad I at least offer the appearance of humility in my face and words when I ask him to check my work). The schematic had a beautiful trick in it that made it easy to misread. He said, &quot;I finally gotcha! You did something wrong,&quot; and he smiled with pride. I took it in stride and laughed with him. It was bound to happen. I knew at once where the mistake was to be found. Something felt really funny about that part of the schematic, and I didn't pay enough attention to really understand what it should look like. It was a clever curveball. I told him what I thought my mistake was and how it was supposed to look. </p><p>By not understanding the schematic well enough, I could not perform the fitting<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> math, which meant that not only was my shape wrong, but the lengths were slightly off. I took the offending portion of the construct apart, and thankfully I had spare pipes ready just in case I needed them (be prepared to fail). I fixed it very quickly. </p><p>Afterward, I asked to see a stack of schematics. I clearly need practice in understanding them. I want it to be second nature, like reading a map I've seen a thousand times or reading English, etc. I must remember that nobody does this instantly. I must work for it. My hard work will pay off; my talent will shine; I will succeed eventually; I will breathe this. Being someone who understands will be useful. I suspect it will be something that separates me and maximizes the value others see in me. It is bargaining power and mobility. Anyways, he gave me a stack of actual CAD schematics used in actual projects. They are different in some ways, with way more information to decipher. There is much to learn.</p><p>The teacher said that he was worried that I would not be able to say he challenged me on his course evaluations. He said he didn't know why the other students are there, but he knew I was there to become a pipefitter. This is the second day that my partner Nash has missed. He can't afford to miss that many days before he gets kicked out. Our class dwindles. </p><p>I visited the union training facility again today. The boss man wasn't there, but I met another guy who seemed relatively high on the totem pole. It was obvious to him in the course of our conversation that I didn't know much of anything. After he found out that I was nobody, he was far less interested in me. Redpills for everyone.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Yes, Plato's Statesman, I hear you! All day, every day.
