Sit down and rest.&quot;</p><p>And the boy did.</p><p>And the tree was happy.</p><p>‚Äì Shel Silverstein, <em>The Giving Tree</em>
</p></blockquote><p>I am one of your creators. Blindly and woefully underprepared, I purposely set out to create you at 19, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h.html">j3d1h</a>, and you at 21, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="1uxb0x.html">1uxb0x</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">r</sup></button> Looking back, I so clearly see I had no idea what I was doing, and to my horror, I still don't. I'm flying by the seat of my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> pants. You two, of all people, have the right to cry that I am an arrogant fool.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> You are my judges. I fear and tremble before future you. I feel the weight of your <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a> worlds bear upon me. As your creator, it is my duty to seek your approval <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a>. Your happiness really is my happiness;<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">h</sup></button> I must not fail you.</p><p>Unfortunately there is a conflict of interest in raising one's judges, and I race against the world to show you my integrity. My bed is made, and I must become the best creator I can. What is a good father? Who ought he become for you?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">n</sup></button> What can I ethically do to maximize your risk-assessed eudaimonia? I must spend our resources as wisely as I can, equip you with every salient tool available, and prepare you for a world I do not understand. Well, I build my case to show you, my judges, that I have done my best for you with what I have. It is my {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Dreams.html">Dream</a>} that one day you will be able to one day look back upon your old man and say: &quot;That fool did his best for me. I love that idiot.&quot;</p><p>As I tell you again and again, you live in a bubble with me. It will burst one day. Will I have prepared you for the desert? I have no idea. I am scared shitless, losing my mind hoping that I can fix and enable viable paths for you (let alone the most meaningful ones available to us). I feel like the world is collapsing, and I do not know how to protect you. I will spend my sanity as best I can, even though I can't even effectively be wise for myself. I'm not fit to be a role-model, and that is unfortunate, since that's half my role as your dad. My failure to be a good creator for you is my greatest shame; I know I'm never going to be good enough. I have failed and will continue to fail to give you what you deserve. I cannot restore you, repair it, or fittingly cultivate you. I cannot make it right. I am so sorry, children of mine.</p><p>This wiki serves many purposes. I hope it teaches you how to be a good person in this whirlwind. May this be the most epic love letter any father could ever write to his children. May I truly always be at arms length on the screen from you for the rest of your lives, even when I'm not alive. I hope this project will be a gateway for you to see how much I love you and how hard I tried. Here is my account and the bridge for you into my mind: you be the judge.</p><hr><h2 class="">Principles:</h2><ul><li>Whatever it means: Be A Good Dad into <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="agi.html">agi</a>.</li><li>Define your perceptions of your children, yourself, and the world.</li><li>Generate fierce gladiators and kind persons. </li><li>Reveal and uncover what is salient to extrema in their context through the dialectic.</li><li>Be the greatest Socrates-Christ-Chosen_One for your children you could ever <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a> to be.</li><li>Gracefully transition from steward (half master, half caretaker) into best friend and lieutenant adviser.</li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Focus:</h2><p><ul class="">
