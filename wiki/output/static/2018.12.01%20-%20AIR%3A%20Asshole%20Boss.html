TUE 3:08 PM

THU 7:55 PM
/bow, my good, sir. =)
FRI 7:36 PM
How you hangin in there?
FRI 7:36 PM
What you up to this weekend?
8 HR AGO

8 HR AGO

Yeah just been super busy at work been working about 14 hours a day we have had a shit tone of party's but after tomorrow it should be over with
16 MIN AGO
I hope you have a solid breather. Maybe have a dank bowl.
15 MIN AGO
Working a fuckton. You able to get enough sleep?
15 MIN AGO
Is your boss still being a complete asshole?
15 MIN AGO

Fuck yeah
7 MIN AGO
Yeah it's working great
7 MIN AGO
That is a high compliment.
7 MIN AGO
I think so. The assistant GM who just quite pulled me aside and we talked.
6 MIN AGO
Ooohhhh
6 MIN AGO
And, how did that go?
6 MIN AGO</code></pre><p>My brother called me briefly. Assistant GM offered to write him a recommendation letter. My brother doesn't have to rely upon his boss here since several are backing him up. Management has been hearing how much of a fucking exploitative asshole he has been to my brother. They have stopped by to say they love him (which is code for &quot;we make a lot of money off you; if we make you feel better, we won't have to pay you more&quot;). I hope my brother continues to look for other positions. I'm not sure he knows where he might want to go, which I can appreciate.</p><hr><p>He called me again toward the end of his shift. He's feeling more and more motivated to find another job. I hope he will look far and wide. The next step matters a great deal, imho. I am proud that he defends himself and others against this psychopath. I also agree that he should look to make sure that he can have this man's recommendation, but he must also be willing to leave without it.</p></div>
