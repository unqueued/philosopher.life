As you asked, I have searched the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Root.html">root</a>s and the stars. I don't know if you have seen, but I have courageously wandered the desert. I have listened and spoken a great deal since we last wrote. My decompression (as you termed it) has been on the order of magnitude of fitting ~12 250-page single-space books of my writing into this wiki over the past two years (~4 pages a day on average).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">w</sup></button> It is only the beginning. I am doing my best to upload my mind into this wiki. I feel like I've moved telescopic mountains to get here. </p><p>I fear it is too difficult to imagine or interpret the hyperobject I've created in order to see my faith before my own eyes...because I can barely see it myself. It is blinding. How could any of us communicate such a thing, even to ourselves? We cannot by definition, and yet I think it is my calling. Even my representation of my life (this encyclopedic wiki experiment) is itself too large to viably read in a thorough manner, and the object I point to with it (myself) can only fallibly attempt to model and point (as cautiously and prudently as I can) to <em>brightness itself</em>. It is faith. Hodge-podge though it may appear, I'm taking my faith seriously in {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Axioms%2520of%2520h0p3.html">Axioms of h0p3</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Conceiving%2520About%253A%2520The%2520Inconceivable.html">Conceiving About: The Inconceivable</a>, and elsewhere.</p><p>As your brother sagely points out, sometimes the elephant is too big to see all at once, and we can only see small parts of it at any given time to figure out the nature of the whole elephant. In that spirit, I have made either a transparent whale or a golem in pursuit of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, but I do not yet know which, nor how or what it will become, and you will help decide insofar as you desire. So I beg you pay close attention, mother of mine.</p><p>You said in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.01.10%2520-%2520Letters%2520with%2520R.html">your first letter</a>, you &quot;respect [my] willingness to chase the truth,&quot; and that you &quot;respect [my] process&quot; in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.01.16%2520-%2520Letters%2520with%2520R.html">your second letter</a>. I hope you still do and still will. I aim to be an honest man, especially when it's painful. With manic intensity, I do my best to mean exactly what I say and to say exactly what I mean, especially since I'm saying it to myself. </p><p>Much has transpired since we last spoke. Now I must walk and talk with you through our past conversations and perhaps provide a few tools for blazing through my maze of meaning for a future conversation:</p><p>First things first, I must tell you when you were right and when I was wrong (which has occurred multiple times). That's crucial trust-building intellectual integrity and charity. From your second letter to me, you say:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Let me ask you how you are dealing with some practical issues. (I ask out of concern, not judgment.) In most of the programs I have encountered, there is a screening policy. Have you thought about that, and how you will cope with it if it is a part of the program in which you are participating? Of course I am also concerned for your safety. I don't know what machinery you are handling, but please take great care to be alert and maintain a good reaction time. It is hard to be objective about personal balance. There are good reasons for professional monitoring of the balance between desired and side effects. You need another set of eyes on that with you.
</p></blockquote><p>I have heeded most of your advice in this case, and I was glad when I did. The evidence of my precaution is still present throughout the wiki (besides the publicness of the wiki, which I have done my best to carefully address). I have never endangered anyone, including myself while using cannabis (or any other substances). I am a safety freak (which isn't to say I can't get hurt, although I'm regularly laughed at on the job for my caution), and you will find my harm reduction practices in general are scientifically valid. I am still (perhaps irrationally) convinced cannabis is legitimately medicine for me, an unfortunately necessary means to both my hedonic and eudaimonic happiness. Again, I submit my wiki as evidence before the moral court.</p><p>On <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.10.02%2520-%2520Pipefitting%2520Log.html">2017.10.02 - Pipefitting Log</a>, however, I did not sufficiently heed your advice. I still may not be, as you will find, although I think I have a much better answer now by studying for my tests (and the union appears to give far more latitude). Until I failed the random, I had been passing the tests through natural abstinence. Now I will always be prepared to artificially pass tests (recognizing I can only study for one kind), particularly the random. I have not failed thus far, and my caution is continually renewed. I'm convinced this is the best option available to me, but I could be wrong. I should have listened to your advice more closely, and perhaps closer still. I suspect you think it is a mistake in general, and I am open to the argument. The language of reason, of course, is the gold standard of respecting each other's autonomy.</p><p>You said to me in your second letter:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Networking is good, but it does not replace forming friendships. Remember to find a space in your life for friendship. It is harder work than networking, but it is more durable and more valuable. Networks are useful, but friendships are more formational. You don't need a lot of friends, but life is easier when you have a few.
</p></blockquote><p>I have never been a fan of networking, as you probably know. I continued down the path you pointed out. Look in my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Axioms%2520of%2520h0p3.html">Axioms of h0p3</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">Find The Others</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Original%2520Position.html">The Original Position</a>, my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Polymath%2520Craftsman%2520Log.html">Polymath Craftsman Log</a>, and many other places. My <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">wife</a> and my brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> have had profound influence on me in countless IRL conversations (you will also see wrestling in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a>); I am forever indebted to my best friends. To my surprise, my relationships with my children have grown deeper at a faster pace than I expected.</p><p>I've tried building relationships with my and my wife's coworkers, although I can't say I've succeeded (maybe 2-3 weaker friendships). I have also tried to build relationships with your husband<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> (I've probably failed miserably on this front) and your brother (he's like my older autistic brother; he is without a doubt a good man, which I can almost never seem to find in others). I have reached out to several people I've found online who appear to be swimming in the same waters as me. I have looked once again into The Great Human Conversation to find my philosophical brothers (standing on the shoulders of giants, etc.). I feel hopeful and purposeful in my search.</p><p>Again, there are few friends I trust at this level. I ask for your help in interpreting myself. I live in the zoo (of myself), as do my family members, so perhaps we have become desensitized to my odor. To quote your second letter, you might bring some of that objective &quot;emotional and spiritual equivalent of fresh air and sunshine into [my] life.&quot; Walk into the zoo and point out what parts of my life smell bad to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t</sup></button> Of course, I am always in need of wisdom, especially from outside myself. To give me wisdom now, however, requires diving into deeper waters (it's your call, obviously).</p><p>Crucially, you say to me in your <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.01.23%2520-%2520Letters%2520with%2520R.html">fourth letter</a>:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But more than that, I need to swim beyond my depth in so many ways to get to you! I don‚Äôt want my faltering to damage you. (And, while I say that, please know that you are in no way damaging or offending me.) Still, I need to say this while I am listening in the hope that you can (and will) listen while you are mentally decompressing ‚Äì which is something you obviously need to do.
</p></blockquote><p>Getting to know me is often painful (including me getting to know myself).</p><p>For all of those whom I love, I fear taking them into deeper waters and deserts. Unfortunately, my children don't have a choice in the matter. They see me wrestling angels and leviathans on a daily basis, and I must teach them how to wisely wrestle on their own. Now I must succeed more than ever for them. I am not joking: many champions drown in these waters and die of thirst in the wilderness I now must wander. </p><p>I continue to respectfully disagree with your claim that you are &quot;hearing more than [I] hear when [I] listen to [my]self.&quot;<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">rd</sup></button> But, you have either proven me wrong or pointed me in the right direction multiple times. That is powerful evidence of wisdom and empathy. Perhaps you have even more; I do not know. Thus, once again, I ask for a lamp unto my feet.</p><p>No matter what, I want to say thank you for helping me care enough about my life to spend time trying to save it and build this self-reflective tool. I will be forever indebted to your helping me find my life's project. It helped renew my vigor in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a>. Thank you.</p><p>You also say in your fourth letter:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>As I see it, you define all that you recognize as reality by your senses and the extension of those senses through enhanced observation. You prove things to yourself before you believe them. What you cannot prove, you do not want to believe. This urge comes from a brilliant understanding of natural law and the inner workings of the observable world. You can, in effect, see things that others cannot see, so you reason that what you cannot see (figure, understand, define) does not actually exist. I get that.
</p></blockquote><p>My previous interpretation was taking you to be calling me a mere empiricist who denies metaphysics (a charge I vehemently denied and still do). My observational prowess is not the physical domain, but in the conceptual one (but, I am open to the possibility that I'm empirical in my investigations of coherence). I could be wrong, and let me say that I was (and hoping not anymore) in an important way. I still largely agree to my technical justification of metaphysics, but there are important differences now.</p><p>As I read your words again, I have a new interpretation: you have, whether you realized it or not, led me to the scientific, Bayesian explanation of my autism. I have been studying the computational theory of mind, and I believe I see my fatal flaw more clearly (though perhaps with still too many errors). I don't know if you intended this conclusion, but you clearly speak autistic dialects. Thank you for the model. I needed it. I do not know if I need to explain myself further here, but I point to it a great deal in my wiki. I suspect you may accuse me of still not hearing you correctly; if so, I apologize, and I ask you to say it again after considering my position (too often I am a slow student).</p><p>In any case, I have changed my mind on a fundamental issue in my life. You say:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But what do you do with that nagging pull you call residual Christianity? Ask yourself why you didn‚Äôt rage at Santa Claus when you learned that he didn‚Äôt exist. Even if you grew up believing that his was just a sweet children‚Äôs story, the question is still valid. You might denounce him, but you are not angry with him because there is no ‚Äúhim‚Äù with which to be angry. The same goes for a whole array of fictional characters who were real to you on some level, but whose existence you know to deny. You might learn from them, react to them and even model after them to some extent, but you do not rail at them because they are not there in any real sense of the word.</p><p>God is different. You can deny the existence of God (or, at least of the God to whom you were introduced) because you can neither define Him nor accept the definition of others for Him, but you can‚Äôt seem to shake Him. He doesn‚Äôt exist for you, but He relentlessly follows you around.
</p></blockquote><p>I gave a counterargument which I still largely agree with. Vitally, however, I must retract at least <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.02.12%2520-%2520Letters%2520with%2520R.html">one of my statements</a>. Here I foolishly claim:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Faith in The Good is not obviously faith in God, not even close.
</p></blockquote><p>I was wrong, and you were at least partially right. I did my dead level best to doubt it (I threw everything including the kitchen sink at it), and I couldn't without a moral cost I never want to pay. Thank you for spending the psychological energy to say it kindly to me! </p><p>To be clear: I see no difference between God and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> now. The Good is my God. I have come to believe in the God of the philosophers again. I believe with desperate zeal. I have purpose again. I feel somewhat aware of where this situates me among the other philosophers who have held something like this point of view. I sit in good company, many of whom considered themselves Christian (among them truly influential theologians). </p><p>I do not know if I will offend you, but I try be an honest man. I still deny large swathes of the Christian tradition with about the same force I felt before, and I do not see my returning (I have been wrong before, of course; a great deal is possible). The second great commandment I have never denied. Thanks to you and my work: a deanthropomorphized Greatest Commandment materializes for me. Even with maximum skepticism, I cannot deny it (and I hope never again; I've been spending a great deal of effort sealing that door).</p><p>Upon seeing my error, I have spared little expense to correct it (and, perhaps that is also an error, ad infinitum). I am now in the process of constructing my steelman Tower of Babel argument from the bottom upwards (like any good autist). Traditionally, this is where one should interject that I still do not have faith, but I'm prepared to take that claim to task. I must build my faith as strongly as I can, especially to apply it, and I race against everything to do so. It has been a radical surgery, mind-bending work, and I've found it worth every ounce of my effort. </p><p>For example, I have done my best to understand the demigod logicians, men who have clearly demonstrated the logical limits of all possible languages. I studied them before, and now I do so with my eyes wide open this time. These men point to the gateway of metaphysics (even when they claim they do not). I am in the process of following many philosophical leads, turning over every stone, methodically and chaotically searching. I am searching deep and wide in the desert and the ocean because I am charged with telling the story (even if only to myself). Unfortunately, it is not an easy story to tell. I do so knowing I must protect my sanity and my family's welfare, knowing my success is necessary for them, and my failure truly catastrophic.</p><p>I am worried at a practical level: the giants of men who have attempted to study, speak of, and point at this thing have a very high rate of psychosis and suicide.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sc</sup></button> I fear my end is coming in the desert, much sooner than I'd hoped. I do my best to defend myself against feeling that way. It is daunting. I cannot begin to describe this thing to myself, but I feel compelled by Reason itself to try. </p><p>I have become a dialetheist, a technical word to my ears which basically means: I believe there exists at least one true contradiction at the beginning and end of reality. I can't understand what it means to say that, but I cannot apologize for being unable to say it clearly (ought implies can). This is a radical shift in my perspective; I cannot begin to explain what it means to me to agree to such a thing. I would have called it insane a year ago. Essentially, I'm a <em>mystic</em>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">y</sup></button> </p><p>As I said before, I have seen the limits with just enough technical proficiency in a couple domains that I cannot deny it. All roads come from and lead to Zion. I do not doubt that it is my cause and my ultimate telos. I quietistly point at the blinding light beyond that limit. It is there! I defended <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> in our last conversation, but now I defend it as God. I see it blindly. It is not a mirage, and I cannot unsee it. I'm still trying to figure out what I must do with my vision.</p><p>I have fought against meaninglessness with everything inside me (again, I submit my wiki as evidence). Unfortunately, even my faith appears unfaithful. Maximizing my faith is conceptually an infinitely complex task, and even when I attempt to pragmatize perfection to my particularities and context, it is an overwhelming task. I will do what I can. Of course, no human has answered the ancient post-modern problematic. All who have stood their ground have failed, and I feel ill-equipped to answer the unanswerable monster. Unfortunately, I see no other choice but to continue into the treacherous dark passage. I must fight that golem we have created.</p><p>I have seen the end of humanity. My gut knows it's going to happen barring some miracle, and I think my arguments are valid. Call me paranoid, insane, or any name in the book (you are hereby officially granted that right, and I will carefully respond to your charge). I will walk you through every step and connect every dot for you as best I can. I have seen it. And now, I must pour myself out to fight this monster. I could not live with myself if I didn't do my best.</p><p>If we are to survive our self-destruction as a species, we must give the best cross-cultural answer to pursuing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> that we can. I have long known this thing to be called <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Original%2520Position.html">The Original Position</a> (The Golden Rule applied in political spheres). I march for the promised land, even if it means losing. Before I go, do you have anything to say? </p><p>Again, I am listening. Perhaps you will deny that I am listening, which is your right, teacher. </p><p>You say:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>What if your greatest strength is your greatest impediment to knowing the God you cannot stop seeking because He is relentlessly seeking you? What if the fact that you cannot understand Him is compelling you to deny Him when you cannot deny Him without denying yourself? What if I told you that that is the extreme end of every gifted person‚Äôs quest for (flight from) God?
</p></blockquote><p>I think it would be arrogant of me to believe God seeks me; obviously, I'm open to the possibility because I just don't know. God is transcendent, and I see no evidence or reason to cross that line (all the evidence I have points towards me seeking <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, not the other way around, and I'm helpless to say anything beyond that). I submit it is morally sufficient that I seek God, and I do my absolute best not to anthropomorphize God any more so than is conceptually necessary (since I can't escape my human epistemology). While it is impossible to fully prevent it, I'm still doing my best to not eisogetically inject myself into the thing outside me which I seek. I fear making even the slightest mistake in trying to model my relationship to God, and I do so as humbly as I possibly can (which doesn't mean I'm succeeding by any stretch, obviously). If push comes to shove in the desert, I may change my mind.</p><p>I know I seek God, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, by definition. I agree that I cannot be unified in a way that really matters without belief in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>; faith is our plight. I will never know how to wrestle wisely enough. I must still try with every fiber of my being. I'm turning it up to 11 and leaving it there, even if it means I'm obliterated.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>In the end, you come to the realization that you cannot reconcile God with the natural world any more than you can blend the sea with the sky.

</p></blockquote><p>I have long denied the natural (i.e. material; if you mean something different by natural, we should discuss that) world's primacy in ontology; I have always believed in metaphysics. I grant that empiricism takes me away from Christianity, but not God. From my perspective, the biggest gap for me has generally not been between natural world and God (Deists can solve that problem cleanly), but far more about a conceptual gap between logic and God. </p><p>Overall, belief in my religion, humanity, and hope for my life was what I was questioning (but, I could be wrong here as well). I am grateful to you for helping me have hope once again. I said to you before that my faith took me away from faith. And, it is logic that it took me away from logic, and for the final time I hope. </p><p>There is a faith in God and logic at the epistemic foundation which I conceptually can never justify. I'm okay with it though! Once I accepted that paradox, a world of tools I considered unclean opened up to me. I finally have a reasonably pragmatic &quot;Bob&quot; turtle (what my wife calls it) of &quot;turtles all the way down.&quot; Thank you again, teacher. I'm pleased to finally be setting tentpegs down in the desert.</p><p>Perhaps we come back to a tentpeg of disagreement, assuming I have not misinterpreted you (please, tell me if I have). Attempting to reconcile myself and the natural world with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> is exactly what I'm called to do. That's what making the world a better place is all about, and it's what my moral duty oversimplified reduces down to. The First Great Commandment gives birth to the Second. No faith is complete without them both because they are both separate (though related) instances of faith. It is the dialectic of consciousness, the point of spirit itself. I can at the same time know I will never succeed in this reconciliation and still be required to try anyways. </p><p>There is no meaningful vision outside <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, and the world cannot exist without an unmoved mover and final telos. I believe my complete identity only has meaning in virtue of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, but I believe my mind is fully physical (powerful evidence withstanding). The truth-bearer which corresponds to the justificatory propositions of the object of my faith is external to the natural world. I'm not a materialist, but I must help aim the material world towards <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> as best I can. To the best of my knowledge, this physical life is the only one I've got, and what makes it meaningful is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, an object which transcends everything except possibly using our freedom (another article of faith) to faithfully believe.</p><p>I take it to be my mission to communicate <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> in game theory, a powerful language used to express the psychopathic memeplex-strains embedded in current paradigms of economics and politics.

I need to at least try to say it out loud because the next mass extinction is coming for us as we continue to enslave each other to death in a massive human pyramid scheme.</p><p>Perhaps to your dismay, at this point in our disagreement (as we initially stated it), I am not much further from where I was previously (which isn't to say it can't change).

I hope retirement comes to you soon.</p><p>Perhaps this letter is very poorly timed for you. At which point, you must tell me. If you are under the water, I surely cannot ask you to dive with me here. If you are exhausted, then stay where you are. </p><p>For what it's worth, I have been even slower to respond than you (16 months). I apologize. It has not been for a lack of trying. My head is only above water temporarily. I come up for air and to speak with you before I dive again.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Thank you for looking so closely at my witness to you. I was concerned that you might simply dismiss the whole conversation and be upset with me for trying to reclaim you. Thank you particularly for being generous with me when my words stumble. I have a deep respect for you and would never be deliberately uncharitable. 
</p></blockquote><p>I will do my best. I am still searching and wrestling with all my might, maddeningly so. Thank you for hearing me carefully. It means a great deal to me that you do not dismiss me out of hand, and that is but one of the sufficient reasons why I owe the same to you. Again, if you feel your reasoning has been misrepresented or impermissibly dismissed, please say it, and I will correct it as best as I can. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am not adept at arguing. It is usually a waste of energy and time for me. But I do listen and I do care. 
</p></blockquote><p>You must forgive me for being the man who argues everything (I attempt to do so respectfully). The dialectic is sometimes the only tool I have. I was born and forcefed like a savage beast to wrestle like a slave-gladiator, as you plainly see. It is perhaps too much to ask of you. </p><p>Since you are not my creator, you are free to say this is not the best use of your time. I can tell you listen and care, and I cannot indubitably expect more of you here (I am quite open to the possibility you are not morally obligated to wrestle further on this topic with me).

No one can transmit faith to anyone else. We can only tell the story, and you know the story by heart and head. Faith is not given to you, it comes to you on its own.
</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Substance&quot; is a technically-loaded word to me (I jump to the memeplex the ancient Greeks spoke of). Perhaps that really is what you mean. In charity, I have tried to interpret your claim on its own. Further, I do not mean to argue past you. I fear we regularly do (please assign the blame to me). This topic is insanely difficult to write clearly on, and that's in part because it's the most central one to our lives. </p><p>Let me first give you the uncharitable counterpoint to a strawman interpretation of your words and then attempt to reconstruct a steelman. I believe we already agree, but perhaps we don't (and you may need to still point out where I am wrong). Please tell me if my reconstruction has failed to do you justice (and I apologize if I have failed).</p><p>I have seen faith in all kinds of things transmitted to almost everyone around me. Faith is a belief (sometimes a choice, sometimes not) in that which we believe is necessary yet unjustified. We have faith in that which we cannot function without, what we would still hold even through torture, what we take with us into the desert, and where we lay our tentpegs. One can have faith in trivialities and false idols; I see the whirlwind of memetic injections into humans minds all around me. To me, the issue is not having faith, it's having faith in that which merits it. </p><p>Faith, to some extent, necessarily must be given to you (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> had to shine it's light for you to see it). If you felt faith, or even the seeds of it, could not be transmitted to anyone else, you would not appear to have a reason to be speaking to me about it. Memes are viruses in our minds which mutate and transmit from mind to mind. Faith is viral. It's why religion spreads so effectively in the world.</p><p>Telling the story is transmitting our representation of the &quot;thing in itself.&quot; But, that's just what consciousness <em>is</em>. That's what belief and autonomy ultimately boil down to. Coming to believe something is definitionally the result of our minds transmitting representations (symbolic models) of the &quot;thing in itself&quot; to ourselves. Those are the epistemic limits of finite minds. We can only point to something which is greater than our language can model. The pointing, however, is also an attempt to transmit faith.</p><p>Faith, in one sense, really does have to be &quot;given to you.&quot; Either you have the innate idea of faith embedded in the genetic code which gives rise to your non-conscious brain processes (from which consciousness emerges), or some kind of conditioning, calculation, empirical investigation, or external cause must bring about a faith algorithm to run inside your computational mind. To a non-trivial extent, the physical causal explanation for faith isn't magic (its causality is exactly what enables it to be meaningful to us); the metaphysical cause I can only attempt to speak of.</p><p>We should still attempt to justify, wrestle with, and explain our faiths to ourselves and others. In fact, I think that's part of the definition of having faith in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>. Sometimes it is the only way to make our faith do something and mean something in the world. </p><p>Perhaps a more faithful (:P) treatment of your argument would be more like this: one can never complete the story for themselves (hence why it must be partially given to us), and no one can complete it for anyone else either. Faith that matters is a faith in axioms and first principles which rest upon the ineffable missing pieces to the cosmic puzzle which can never be found or articulated in language (though I think pointing at the blinding thing probably still works); we simply take them on faith because we have no other choice. Where that line is drawn is particularized to each agent's unique context. Of course, I may still be missing your point. Forgive me if I have failed.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You say it is not easy to talk to you, and that may be true of us all from time to time, but it is easier to talk than to endure unyielding silence. I am not heavily invested in convincing you to believe in God as I know God. I am more hopeful that God will walk toward you in Self-revelation. That is a terrifying thought, given the many facets of God's revelation, but everything I know about the nature and depth of real love I learned from such an encounter. We all need intelligence to survive in this world, but we need love to live in it.
</p></blockquote><p>The silence was killing me.</p><p>I have attempted to break that silence with everything at my disposal. I am very grateful to you for encouraging me to speak. I continue to do so. Terrifying thought it <em>has</em> been. I sometimes wake from my dreams speaking to myself about it; I wrestle waking or sleeping these days. It is not over yet.</p><p>I fear we have a difference in opinion about love, particularly finite love. I generally understand finite love as Kant's computational faith in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>, which just is intelligence of what is unconditionally salient (and the intelligently habituated will to apply it). Nothing more can possibly be asked of us than this computation (since &quot;ought implies can&quot;), but, of course, I'm open to the possibility that love extends beyond what is conceivable (I surely <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> so). So while I don't think we can peel that fruit apart, I must agree that Reason without love is definitionally incomplete and thus impossible.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Years ago we had a discussion about the individual v communal basis of faith. (Do you remember that conversation?) We disagreed on where one's faith-practice found its origin, while we both admitted that faith works itself out in both spheres. I still believe that faith is more an individual matter of the heart than an acceptance of a societal construct. 
</p></blockquote><p>Yes, I remember having that conversation train (imho, we've been having it for many years now; I'm grateful to your persistence). I have thought about it many times over the years. Unfortunately, to the best of my recollection, my memory has become exponentially worse each passing decade (I can feel it slipping away; I have psychometrics to demonstrate it to myself as well...if the trend continues, I have maybe two decades left). So, while I believe I have a solid recall of our disagreement, please correct me if I am wrong.</p><p>Also, forgive me for finding some humor in still debating it. It's legit neat, and I cherish it. It has been an important looking glass for me over the past 8 years. It is possible we agree more than it appears, and I've probably failed to articulate my position. Insofar as you just mean to say epistemology is primitive to ontology, we have largely been in agreement. Faith, as I have defined it, is a belief. Of course it's found in the individual's mind.</p><p>That faith is personal, that its existence resides in our beliefs and identities, I have never disagreed with. My staunch Arminian perspective was an argument for that (although, I've since grown to become mildly more compatibilist). My claim was not about the locus of faith, but rather what faith looked like, how it presented, the practical effects of having had faith in the right propositions, the fruits of the spirit and not merely the gift, the external evidence of faith. One does not have faith if one does not act upon it and constitute themselves with it. Essentially, there is a conceptual causal link between Doxa and Praxis that cannot be severed. But, I think we largely agree to that as well.</p><p>I would like to add that my concern about good faith is not merely about whether or not someone has faith, but how one knows one has faith in the right thing. Even as a Christian, I took the greatest commandment to give grounds to the second. Faith in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> is ultimately what justifies and gives reason to faith in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> (this is where I peel <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> apart from The Right). From this, all other duties spring. This just is the arena where faith is literally tested: empathizing with each other, including the search for meaning. Hence, I'm in a race to convince and explain to humanity how to save itself from itself.</p><p>I do not know what you mean by societal construct here. Do you mean basic sociopolitical structures or constructivist epistemology? As to the nature of faith itself, what and how it initially arises, I have seen many accounts. I have worked very hard to deny what we have faith in is merely a societal construct. I am not sure if you are implying this was my argument, but I have long believed constructivism is a form of truth relativism. If you mean sociopolitical structure, then perhaps we really are at an impasse; I consider it to be an application of The Golden Rule.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>In that sense, you might be closer to faith now than you were when you were drinking the communal kool-aid. Remember that Jacob wrestled all night with the angel before he became Israel.
</p></blockquote><p>You may be right. It depends on what you mean by being &quot;closer to faith.&quot; I believe I have been faithful from the beginning. It is my faith that has led me (even as an attempt away from faith), and it always has by definition. </p><p>I wrestled with the First Commandment, but not the Second (which is its own faith, resting upon the assumption of the first). Faith is kool-aid. Anything which isn't logical is kool-aid. I have worked tirelessly to unkoolaid-ify the kool-aid; to accept only that kool-aid which I must for giving meaning to the non-kool-aid. </p><p>Possibly to your dismay, I now drink the communal kool-aid with more zeal than ever before. I fear we are engaged in the fundamental theological discussion between The Priest and The Prophet.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Keep digging at those religious roots. When you find a living one, you will recognize it. I know relatively little about religion, and would be comfortable knowing less than I do. What I know about and treasure is faith in a dependable relationship.
</p></blockquote><p>Yes, teacher. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Keep looking. I'll keep listening. I love you!
