10 hours ago
 Like absolutely do not want to do anything. It‚Äôs bad.
10 hours ago
 I know that feel!
10 hours ago
 I have to fight the feeling of ‚Äúthis is going to be pointless‚Äù because I don‚Äôt want to screw over everyone I‚Äôm leaving behind.
10 hours ago
 I see why so many people have left this job so angry... I think anger is one of the only ways you can actually leave it.
10 hours ago
 It sounds like you are motivated!
10 hours ago
 just not to do give shit about your current occupation
10 hours ago
 personally, I wouldn't sweat it...but, I could be wrong
10 hours ago
 I appreciate that you don't want to screw others over here
10 hours ago
 You might give them transition material that you slowly accumulate/build
10 hours ago
 Personally, I'd be spending non-trivial portions of my job-time finding another job, lol.
10 hours ago
 I don't think you owe Humana a damned thing, but you know my position.
10 hours ago
 Girl, you got me all angry for you, lol.
10 hours ago
 Okay, my goal is to empathize with your position as best as I can. You do not want the pointless feeling. Like the game is already over because  you know it's a deadend. I feel that. Now, I know it is the male/engineer/autist in me that says &quot;how do we fix it?&quot;...but, I've come to learn that is not what everyone needs immediately.
10 hours ago
 I feel your pain of the pointlessness!
10 hours ago
 I'm sorry it's a rough day.
10 hours ago
 It‚Äôs alright ‚Äî your empathy actually means a lot.
10 hours ago
 I think my anger/frustration is good fuel for me. My conversation with [[JRE]] about feeling trapped in a job that is not well described and goal-less really hit home for me. It helped me see and properly define my problem.
10 hours ago
 Which is truthfully half the battle for me.
10 hours ago
 I don‚Äôt feel I owe Humana anything, more my coworkers who have become friends. The last thing I want is to spurn them before I leave. I‚Äôd rather motivate them to move on themselves.
10 hours ago
 All of them are in my same position I think, as they all exhibit similar signs to varying degrees.
10 hours ago
 Two of us are actually making steps to look for another job, and I‚Äôm worried the remaining two will let it all collapse on themselves.
10 hours ago
 Okay, thank you for letting me get all that off my chest so suddenly. I needed someone to vent to.
10 hours ago
 Lol, np.
10 hours ago
 As my immediate family lovingly half-jokes with me (particularly my daughter), I am &quot;the worst:&quot; please consider writing more about it.
10 hours ago
 My favorite part about talking to you is you‚Äôre not afraid to get into the nitty-gritty. My desire to dive into the ugly conversations does not deter you, which can‚Äôt be said for everyone.
10 hours ago
 I am actually keeping a small log to help me stay motivated. I will consider posting it for you.
10 hours ago
 It‚Äôs basically the ‚Äúhere are my ugly emotions through this process hurray I can do it‚Äù
10 hours ago
 yay!
10 hours ago
 It is the seed of new habits.
10 hours ago
 Hehe.
10 hours ago
 Honestly the biggest transition is just learning to do it on the computer. I used to do it as a kid all the time. There‚Äôs a single diary I wrote in throughout most of my youth and re-reading it reminds me of things I definitely would have forgotten otherwise.
10 hours ago
 That transition is hard. Read a weird book about note taking on paper recently: https://philosopher.life/#How%20to%20Make%20a%20Complete%20Map%20of%20Every%20Thought%20you%20Think:%5B%5BHow%20to%20Make%20a%20Complete%20Map%20of%20Every%20Thought%20you%20Think%5D%5D

 SMSed the dude, and he called me back. Hopefully will learn more about his thoughts on it.
8 hours ago
 Nice
7 hours ago
 Sorry, was taking my frustrations out on cleaning. I did some research on how to get my EIT. Looks like I have lots of studying ahead of me, which makes sense.
7 hours ago
 To respond to your second bit ‚Äî I frequently have to keep a pen and paper with me to take notes.
7 hours ago
 So this man speaks to me, though I am attempting to make the transition as much as I can.
7 hours ago
 When I'm on a jobsite where I'm not allowed to use electronics, I'm forced to write. It's especially nice for drawing. The transition ain't easy.</code></pre></div>
