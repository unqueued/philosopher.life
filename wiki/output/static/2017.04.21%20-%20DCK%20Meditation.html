<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Economics. My kids need to study it. They need to realize how the world works. This is the mathematical expression of human empathy and lack thereof. IT is how we understand ourselves. </p><p>Understand the dimensions of the world. See broadly. Dig deeply. </p><p>One could just record one's life with video. It doesn't give it the meaning we expect. It doesn't have the analysis we need. Writing might ultimately be reductive, but it is in the process of reduction that we find the meaning we were looking for.</p><p>I feel like myself again on K. Jesus. It's like bursting out of the surface of the ocean from the depths.</p><p>Treat your children as adults. Bootstrap them. They will be adults. Just be practical. Theory will come!</p><p>DCK is clearly the drug that I really need. It takes me out of my fog. </p><p>Realpolitik Speculation needs to become a place where I make practical moves. We're playing likes its a video game? It isn't constructive enough. The inspection is obviously necessary, but we have to build something after the pieces fall. It's important to rebuild. Don't you remember what the world wars taught us? We must rebuild that which we deconstruct. It is a key expression of empathy and hope. Without it, we devolve yet again.</p><p>I have to show my kids hard work at every angle. Show them how to build things. I need to show them how to build a life by actually building a life for them.</p><p>Don't spend your energy attacking. Spend your energy building. What are you building?</p><p>Make sure you spend your time making yourself happy. That's the point of your writing.</p><p>Empathizing with my wife means allowing her to live her spiritual journey. Help her walk it. Be with her. It is tricky understanding our fundamental disagreement amidst our profound commitment to each other. She continues to shine love. How could you not do the same for her? Why have I not been saying this on my wiki? I'm using my wiki wrong!</p><p>I need to be crazy honest on my wiki. I need to say whatever it is that I'm thinking. </p><p>One of the biggest fishes to fry in my life is how I will understand, empathize, and love my wife. I don't even have the words to describe how much she means to me. I need to write them down. That's the point of this wiki. I need to be able to articulate how and why I love my wife. I need to convert my feelings, desires, and theories into action, constructions, and build towards happiness for my wife. How could I have forgotten her so profoundly in my wiki? Fool! I must focus on her as well. It isn't just my children that give me reasons to live. My wife has been bearing this cross. I will find a way out of this maze. I owe her everything. She doesn't like it when I kiss her feet. But, I want to.</p><p>Prediction: We will have computers compute our minds for us. The possibilities and implications of it are staggering. That is definitely where the Transhumanists point the most. All of this hard work I'm doing on the wiki, it needs computer aiding.</p><p>In a sense, my consciousness is aided by my ability to use this wiki-device. It is a part of my consciousness. Umm....Maybe I need to guard it more carefully than I have. Remember to create backups upon backups! Your life is literally embedded in this thing or at least part of it.</p><p>I wonder what J.K. Rowling would have to say about this. It's kind of like a Horcrux. My goal isn't to be immortal (although, who wouldn't be interested in living forever?). The goal is to be happy. Not being lonely, talking with myself, and being conscious...for happiness, that is the core of cores. </p><p>That reminds me of all the beautiful words in the history of humanity. Centrality, symmetry, core. I should start a collection of concepts I consider to be the most beautiful. Plato's Domain. That is the place to do it.</p><p>I fear that I have seen my wiki as a place to publish, but not as a place to just write. I need to strike the right (write) balance, amiright? I need to get it out of me. I must not impede myself. Although, one thing I really love about the wiki is the ability to give structure to what I'm doing. The fact that it morphs, changes, and perhaps even through a hermeneutic spiral takes up new telos' qua its original telos. </p><p>Others will be put off by it for various reasons. You are constructing the Truth. Do it for yourself. </p><p>I need more flexibility in my wiki. There are 10,000 things to do, and I can't do them all. Triage. 	</p><p>I need to continually be &quot;Loosey-Goosey&quot; in principle. I need to be flexible. I need to be able to completely flip it. I need to be meta about it all. I need have freedom with myself. I need to make sure that I do not build a prison for myself with my wiki. Essentially, I still have a construction problem with my wiki. I tried to formalize it (which was extremely useful in many ways), but this came at the expense of other kinds of introspection, empathy, and the ability to change. </p><p>Also, don't stop using DCK once a week (except, of course, for drug testing purposes). However hard it may be, you cannot stop. You must grind. You love the grind, right? I'm not sure you can afford to empathize with the part of yourself that doesn't love the existential grind. My head hurts.</p></div>
