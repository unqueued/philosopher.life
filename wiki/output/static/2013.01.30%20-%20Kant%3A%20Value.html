Other talents of the mind and character have limitations; they can be twisted to do evil things. Only the good will enables worthiness of happiness.1 Some qualities are instrumentally useful in enabling the good will, but they unconditional worth. Their value stems from the end they cause, the good will. ‚ÄúModeration in affects and passions, self-control, and calm reflection‚Äù aren‚Äôt merely instrumental, but ‚Äúconstitute a part of the inner worth of a person.‚Äù2 .‚Äù Yet, these can be twisted for evil as well, and thus are conditionally good.</p><p>A good will is not good because it causes another end. Even a will which isn‚Äôt efficacious is still a good will.3 Only the good will have absolute worth (value!).4 Surely it can‚Äôt be merely the idea of a good will that is good. It must an instantiation ‚Äì any particular good will is absolutely good.</p><p>I‚Äôm left wondering: Why can‚Äôt action, even while not out of respect for the moral law, have any moral worth? Yes, actions in general are conditional in value. But, why can‚Äôt value be contextual and particularistic? Also, does the good will admit of degrees? I asked this before, perhaps, regarding motivation. I feel as if I‚Äôve either failed to understand the explanation or I‚Äôm unsatisfied with it.</p><p>Reason does not exist for our preservation, welfare, or happiness, but rather for the good will.5 Reason is certainly necessary for producing the good will.6 Is it sufficient? Reason can master our desires and other motivations, so perhaps it may be.7 Also, why should I think reason can master our desires?</p><p>Actions have no worth if they do not come from respect for the moral law. Actions are definitely conditional in their moral value. 8 Kant provides some famous examples (which continue through 398).</p><p>Sometimes it is only respect for the moral law which can motivate us to do an action.9 I need an example action? What sort of action couldn‚Äôt be described by the egoist‚Äôs motivation?</p><p>The concept of morality holds for all rational beings, not just humans.10 Why is the categorical imperative an apodictic law? It seems doubtable to me? Am I not rational? Yes, the CI is based upon pure reason, it is known a priori, and not be based upon experience or even by popular vote, but apodicticity is a very significant claim.11</p><p>Kant explains: ‚ÄúOnly a rational being has the capacity to act in accordance with the representation of laws, that is, in accordance with principles, or has a will.‚Äù12 When reason does not infallibly determine the will, then such a being is necessitated.13 He continues, ‚ÄúThe representation of an objective principle, insofar as it is necessitating for a will, is called a command (of reason), and the formula of the command is called an imperative.‚Äù14 Imperatives are ought for those being which are necessitated.15 No imperatives exist for the divine, holy, perfectly good will; they aren‚Äôt necessitated. Human wills, however, are necessitated.16 There are two kinds of imperatives: hypothetical and categorical. Hypothetical imperatives are practical, instrumental reasoning. Categorical imperative demonstrates what is ‚Äúobjectively necessary of itself, without reference to another end.‚Äù17 So the hypothetical imperative is about actions which are ‚Äúgood merely as a means to something else,‚Äù and categorical imperative is about actions represented as in themselves good, and ‚Äúas necessary in a will in itself comforting to reason.‚Äù18</p><p>For the CI, is the action good in itself? I assume not. What then, it meant here? It seems like the action is instrumental, as it is a necessary means to an end, the end being having a good will. It isn‚Äôt good in itself, I assume, because it could be done not out of respect for the CI, or it is contingent in its efficaciousness, or it could be twisted, maybe.</p><p>I worry that what Kant‚Äôs sketching a better argument for something like moral rationalism than he is about the CI. That moral claims should be motivating in themselves and that they override any other sort of reasons seem to come from his argument. Only those moral propositions which are always true, necessarily true, are those which override all other reasons. Lots of moral theories could agree to that though, right?</p><p>Alright. I have more thoughts and questions, but I‚Äôm feel I‚Äôm way over my limit and that this should be sufficient.</p><p>1 4:393</p><p>2 4:393-394</p><p>3 4:394</p><p>4 Ibid.</p><p>5 4:395</p><p>6 4:396</p><p>7 4:411</p><p>8 4:397</p><p>9 4:407</p><p>10 4:408</p><p>11 4:409</p><p>12 4:412</p><p>13 4:412-413</p><p>14 4:413</p><p>15 Ibid.</p><p>16 4:414</p><p>17 Ibid.</p><p>18 Ibid.</p><hr><p>January 30: Value</p><p>Groundwork Section I (pp. 4:393-397)</p><p>Groundwork Section II (pp. 4:405-414, 426, 437)</p><p>Critique of Practical Reason (pp. 5:57-67)</p><p>Groundwork Section I (pp. 4:393-397)</p><p>4:393, Good will is the only good thing without limitation.
