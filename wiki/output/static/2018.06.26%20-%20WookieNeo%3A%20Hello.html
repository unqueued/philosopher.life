I just recently started doing this myself using dokuwiki. I always wanted to get in a habit of journaling but it never took hold until I started using the a wiki platform. It is just so much easier to explore thoughts when the medium is so fluid, which is why I found handwriting in a journal so restricting.</p><p>The self-reflection portion of my wiki is private. My introspective musings are only important to me. If I ever feel like I make a breakthrough that can benefit others I will write a book. I have never been huge into blog like media, unless it is instructional.</p><p>‚Äì WookieNeo
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Yes. The wiki lowers the friction to explore and express for me too.</p><p>The only thing I feel like handwritten journals have over a wiki is the ability to draw. That can be pretty easily solved if it really matters though.</p><p>I totally appreciate the desire for privacy. Mine started out the same. I spend time explaining why I've moved towards radical transparency. I have found that my friends and family do care about my introspective musings, and that they aren't only important to me.</p><p>Do you have any structural approaches to thinking in your wiki that have been super useful to you? I'm trying to learn more about how to use this tool.</p><p>‚Äì 4eak
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hey I replied to you post about your wiki. I have had the same thought about friends and family. I decided to keep it closed for the most part. A nice thing about dokuwiki is the level of user permissions. So I can open up access in very specific ways to specific people. I have loved meandering your wiki! I am much younger than you in all likelihood, at 23. I too have a background in computers (programming and sysadmin). I dont have much advice for you on an area which you have put considerably more time than I, but I appreciate you asking about it. This is a topic I have though about, how best to organize and approach a wiki for journaling. I am starting to use tags more as I found something resembling a directory structure too limiting and hard to maintain. dokuwiki calls its directory equivalent a namespace. I am aiming to avoid nested namespaces and stick to well defined namespaces and then using tags. I am also starting to break topics down into multiple pages. I have  found it hard to maintain old pages and keep them updated and so having more pages helps with separation of concerns. really I am beginning to see the wiki structure as being similar to good software design.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://wiki.fallalex.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://wiki.fallalex.com/</a></p><p>there is a link to my wiki. I have mostly used it to record processes for work or fun related to sysadmin work</p><p>as far as &quot;structural approaches to thinking&quot; I am really just starting out but I have been avoiding daily updates and instead only updating it when I have new thoughts that I think need to be fleshed out.</p><p>‚Äì WookieNeo
