<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was an excellent day. My teacher brought over a ventilation machine and showed me how to run a basic bead. I made a ton of parallel ones that were snug/adjacent to each other. My teacher was blown away, shocked that I had never had any welding experience. Said it was better than his work. He brought the welding teacher over to look at it, and the welding teacher also praised it. Word spread around the pipefitting and welding classes. Many came to look. It turned out pretty good for a first-timer. </p><p>Johnny, who is well-regarded in the class, who already has a job as a pipefitter, thought I had lied to him when I said I had never welded before (he was the one who offered to show me, but I didn't want to break any of the rules of the shop, so I politely declined). He could not believe it. Multiple people told me to stop being a pipefitter and go straight into welding. My head, obviously, has swelled.</p><p>I moved onto making a gift for my brother. In case he is reading this (which I highly doubt, by his own admission), I won't say what it is (since he wants a surprise). It's a piece of art using pipe and welding. I think it will be fairly cool. I'm about halfway done with it. This coming Thursday, I hope to have it finished.</p><p>I also went to the union on a whim today, and Randy was there! He didn't remember me though, a first, unfortunately. We talked about what I was working on. I pointed out that I was familiar with Blackboard as a teacher (this is not the first tech problem I've seen him have; I could be very useful on this front). I tried to convince him to give me the chance to show him that I will be possibly 3rd-year apprentice material. He prefers experience to classwork, but I think I can impress him. We talked about how he is changing by-laws. It's clear that there will be wiggle room for him to see that I'm worth advancing. He changed the date now to possibly July for hiring. </p><p>They don't use NCCER or the certifications I was told to get. I'm kinda annoyed at that. It's mainly for Eastman I guess. That's fine. They have an in-house training system, but it looks thrown together. That said, some of the work in the shop looks excellent to me (although, some didn't). </p><p>I also, with Randy there, got to pick the brain of a 4th-year apprentice. He was a surly man and obviously didn't make the union look very good (by face, not by content or pay). I can tell I will have many knuckleheads to work with. That's okay though. Building shit and making money, I can put up with it.</p><p>I'm feeling confident. I feel like there is a connected set of worlds I will be able to navigate and bootstrap myself through. Competence is achievable. I just need to push forward, reach out and grab it. It's mine there for the taking.</p></div>
