<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I arrived and waited for them to wait for me on the shuttle. I didn't check to see if another ran after. They saw my Brownie pans.</p><p>We had a weekly safety meeting. A lot of heights this week. We found out we have things to do to do. Huzzah. I used my harness quite a bit today.</p><p>I asked Moose for training on the lifts.</p><p>We started setting up for demoing 4 pipes and welding supports. We only demoed one since there was redtape preventing us from doing the others.</p><p>I got an ironworker fall harness. It didn't have the retractable attached. We all had to work on attaching our own. I figured it out, and I did it for others. It was a pain in the neck to get it on. My hands bled.</p><p>John asked me to scratch his ass. I grabbed his wire brush and laughed. I will dish out just as much shit to him as he gives to me.</p><p>We did lockout tag out. It makes no sense here. I'm going to ask for the training again. I asked for more training on Lock Out, Tag Out. We will get it.</p><p>Mull took me in his vehicle to get my tools. He only talked about a celebrity he knew and the women on the job he wanted to fuck. He also writes poetry. Weird mamajama.</p><p>I helped Mull mount a hose on the AC of his building.</p><p>I gave out brownies at lunch. I think most people appeared to appreciate the gesture.</p><p>We demoed one pipe. But we couldn't do anymore. The Eastman guys assumed I was in charge of the paperwork. Mull and John were happy to let me take care of it. Why?</p><p>We Chip Hammered some bricks off a building to get to the metal support structure. Was difficult work. Lots of caution tape, high scaffolds, etc.</p><p>Afterward, we rigged and stored a bunch of pipe on site, between 309 and 233. I took notes of how much the pipe weighed (bounced between the crane operator and the pipe), and I did some of the wood-laying for the pipe.</p><p>We got out late because it took a long time to deal with the pipe.</p></div>
