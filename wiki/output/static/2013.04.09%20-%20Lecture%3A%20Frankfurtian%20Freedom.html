<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Frankfurt doesn‚Äôt focus on political conceptions of Freedom (as in the tradition of Hobbes and Berlin), instead Frankfurt argues for a particular sort of freedom by modeling the authentic identity of persons. The fundamental question at stake is: Who is the ‚Äúreal‚Äù you?</p><p>Many famous philosophers have defined the real you as the rational you. In contrast, Frankfurt thinks the real you is the hierarchically integrated you, a ‚Äòcongruence between‚Äô and an ‚Äòidentification with‚Äô or ‚Äòendorsement of‚Äô your desires, which is less about rationality and more concerned the structure of your will. </p><p>As persons, we are self-reflective and we are not indifferent to which desires move us. On this view, we form desires about our desires, and our capacity to endorse our desires is what grounds our personhood, our freedom of the will, and our autonomy.
We start with first-order (FO) desires; these are ordinary desires about the world. E.g. I want to eat pizza; I desire sleep; I want cocaine; etc. Every creature with desires has FO desires, and hence FO desires aren‚Äôt very special. FO desires vary in strength, and for example, we might think that without any intervention, the strongest desire is what moves us, it is our will. E.g. If the honey badger desires food more than sleep, he‚Äôll be effectively moved to pursue food instead of sleep ‚Äì that is his (not free) will. </p><p>Naively, second-order (SO) desires are desires about FO desires. E.g. I desire not to want to eat pizza; I want to desire sleep; I don‚Äôt want to want cocaine; etc. Note that my SO desires can conflict with my FO desires. SO desires are found in creatures with more complex psychologies. </p><p>Frankfurt further distinguishes SO desires from SO volitions (where SO volitions are a subset of SO desires). A SO volition is a special kind of SO desire. A SO volition is a desire that some FO desire be or not be your will. A SO volition is a desire for some FO desire to take or lose priority over all other FO desires, such that you will be effectively moved or not moved to act upon some FO desire. A SO volition is the reflective endorsement or repudiation of a FO desire. </p><p>The capacity for and the use of SO volitions is the significant and necessary condition for a creature to be a person. Creatures, including humans, who lack SO volitions (even if they have mere SO desires) are called wantons - they are not persons. Lacking free will is not a problem for wantons, as seen in the case of the wanton addict. On Frankfurt‚Äôs theory, a wanton is exclusively moved by desires he has not identified himself with, endorsed, approved, or made his will. He is not a person because he is merely a being with desires that rule him, and he does not care to or perhaps even have the ability to rule over his desires.
In contrast to a wanton, a person, such as the unwilling addict, has SO volitions. Whether or not those SO volitions ultimately ‚Äúwin out‚Äù determines whether or not a person has freedom of the will.</p><p>When your FO desire and SO volition conflict, and if and when you are moved by a FO desire which you repudiate via a SO volition, you are not acting autonomously or authentically, and essentially, as a person, you lack freedom of the will. Significantly, even though you are moved to act by a FO desire that is in some sense ‚Äòyour desire‚Äô, because that FO desire overrides your SO volition, it seems as though you are forced to act upon a desire which isn‚Äôt really yours ‚Äì you didn‚Äôt endorse that FO desire, in fact, the real you repudiated it. That FO desire which moved you, against your SO volition, is alien to you. The real you is a helpless bystander to the force of the external, inauthentic FO desire. To be authentic, to have freedom of the will, your SO volition must effectively make your FO desire your will. </p><p>Lastly, Frankfurt‚Äôs theory is not actually confined to only two orders of desires. There are third-order desires and volitions, fourth, fifth, and so on. E.g. I can want to want to want pizza, etc. Ultimately, the necessary condition of personhood and autonomy is some sort of capacity to identify ourselves with what we ‚Äúreally want to want to want‚Ä¶to want, and so on,‚Äù a capacity to decisively align our many orders of desires in a resounding commitment, securing conformity between them, and forcibly synchronizing and unifying them (Christine Korsgaard must love this). Unfortunately, Frankfurt does not provide a clear argument about this. This is one of the fuzzier and least clear aspects of Frankfurt‚Äôs theory, despite it being the most important aspect of his theory (it does all the magical work for him). </p><p>Interesting characteristics of this theory:</p><ul><li>A focus upon self-reflection, evaluation, endorsement, authenticity, and ordered desires fits many of our intuitions on the topic of free will and autonomy. Something about the theory seems right.</li><li>It does not require robust metaphysical commitments. The theory sits comfortably in naturalistic philosophical perspectives.</li><li>The theory is neutral to determinism and can work as a compatibilist view of freewill. (Although, it is not necessarily inconsistent with incompatibilism.)<ul><li>Compatibilism is the belief that free will and determinism are compatible ideas, where freedom, in this case, turns out to be something like just doing what you want to do, or willing what you want to will, which is distinct from other standard definitions of freewill, such as: ‚ÄúThe ability to do otherwise.‚Äù</li><li>Incompatibilists think that this kind of freedom isn‚Äôt enough, and they worry that if we are merely deterministic flesh bags of chemicals and electrical signals, then we are no better than any other determined or programmed object. On such a view, we are reducible to a mere mass of determined particles. Why are we any better than complex robots? Why is compatibilist free will actually freedom at all; and why is it worth having? Why would we be morally responsible if we are determined? So, the incompatibilist who believes we are morally responsible must claim we aren‚Äôt fully determined and that we have a kind of libertarian, metaphysically based freewill which overcomes the laws of physics. *Draw a homunculus.*</li><li>Compatibilists will respond by claiming that libertarian freewill is incoherent; that libertarians have failed to provide any suitable account of how it works. The metaphysical commitments are too great for the compatibilist. Further, why are we any better than a random number generator or dice? Why is libertarian freedom worth having?</li></ul></li><li>The account is content-neutral. Persons aren‚Äôt required to have particular values. This sits in stark contrast to other classic theories of autonomy, freedom, and authenticity. <ul><li>This feature is powerful. It has some good aspects to it, but it also may have bring with it some problems which I don‚Äôt have time to go into. </li></ul></li></ul><p>3 Sets of Problems with this account:</p><ul><li>Manipulation. Frankfurt‚Äôs account of freedom and autonomy does not take into consideration ‚Äòwhere a desire came from‚Äô or ‚Äòhow it was acquired.‚Äô It can‚Äôt explain manipulation-based autonomy defeaters such as the problems of poisoned origins or a neuroscientist re-engineering a person‚Äôs desires and beliefs.<ul><li>One paradigm case of manipulation is where a neuroscientist radically alters your desires (and beliefs). For ahistorical accounts of autonomy and freedom, like Frankfurt‚Äôs, as long as the neuroscientist changes you such that a kind of congruence between your FO and higher order desires is maintained, then you are still considered to be autonomous. Frankfurt‚Äôs account doesn‚Äôt seem capable of taking into account how the problem of manipulation, at least intuitively, results in an attack on or elimination of one‚Äôs autonomy and/or the authentic self.</li><li>Don‚Äôt we want a theory of autonomy that allows us to reclaim autonomy from our checkered/conditioned past?</li></ul></li><li>Trilemma: Ab Initio, Infinite Regress, Incompleteness (Christman on Dworkin [who is Frankfurtian])<ul><li>Ab Initio/Problem of Authority ‚Äì How can non-autonomous processes or higher order desires confer autonomy upon lower level desires? How does a particular second-order desire really have the authority to speak for us? Why that one?<ul><li>When a SO volition endorses a FO desire, we take that FO desire to be an authentic desire, a desire of the agent himself, because the agent had to actually endorse it. Initially, it seems as if SO volitions have the power to speak for the authentic self. The problem, however, is that a SO volition needs to be an autonomous desire as well, a desire that really belongs to the authentic agent. If a SO volition is not an autonomous desire, then it seems as if a non-autonomous force is ‚Äòendorsing‚Äô a FO desire, and then it would not appear as if the FO desire is really endorsed by an autonomous agent. How can autonomy arise from non-autonomy? It doesn‚Äôt seem like it can. So, what makes a SO volition an autonomous desire? This brings us to the‚Ä¶</li></ul></li><li>Infinite Regress. - If SO volitions are made autonomous by TO volitions in the same way that FO desires are made autonomous by SO volitions, then we hit the regress problem, whereby we pile desires on top Bibliographyof desires.<ul><li>The argument is that in order to make an N-order desire autonomous, an autonomous N+1-order volition must endorse it. To have an autonomous SO volition requires an autonomous TO volition endorsing it. But, clearly, we can ask the same question about TO volitions, and the answer requires having an autonomous volition from the next higher order endorsing it. This process of trying to autonomize desires with higher order autonomous desires can continue ad infinitum, hence the regress.</li></ul></li><li>Incompleteness ‚Äì If we are to escape the Ab Initio problem without falling into the regress, we have explain how SO volitions are autonomous desires in a way that is different from how SO volitions make FO desires autonomous. Nobody seems to be able to give an explanation, hence the ‚Äúincompleteness‚Äù problem. Which is basically the same thing as saying, we really don‚Äôt have an explanation at all. </li><li>Summary:  On Frankfurt‚Äôs model, we must ask if the relevant SO volitions themselves are autonomous. If not, then we have the ab initio problem.  If so, then how do they become autonomous?  If it‚Äôs in the same way as one‚Äôs first-order desires, then we face a regress.  But if they become autonomous in some other way, then Frankfurt‚Äôs theory is incomplete because he hasn‚Äôt specified the method. He does anticipate the trilemma; he talks about decisively aligning, securing conformity between, or unifying our many orders of desires, but he never really explains how this works. Hence, Frankfurt‚Äôs model is incomplete. </li></ul></li><li>Perhaps you don‚Äôt find Frankfurt‚Äôs argument intuitively compelling. You should ask: Why is Frankfurt‚Äôs freedom of the will worth having? How is a person in this account any more worthy or better off than other animals and wantons? Why does it produce moral responsibility or the kind of agency that matters?</li></ul></div>
