<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">How is your health? Daily routine? </h2><p>My sleep schedule has normalized again. I'm waking up without an alarm clock. I'm still overeating. What's new, yo?</p><hr><h2 class="">What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?</h2><p>I am very worried about my children doing their schoolwork and wiki logs. At this point, it's either one or the other that completes it. I'm not going to be here to motivate them, to hold them accountable, etc. It makes me sick to my stomach. It makes me sad, angry, anxious, and scared. We can't succeed unless they choose to do it with us. This falls apart if they aren't going to do their part. </p><p>I'm worried I'll come back from work on the weekends and find they've done nothing, that they've wasted their lives that week. </p><hr><h2 class="">Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. </h2><p>This is so much responsibility for them. I'm having to ask them to grow up fast. These are key skills for adulthood, particularly for the future I believe is in store for us all. I still think the world is ending, at least for homo sapiens. I think my children are in a long-term fight for survival at this point. The dog-eat-dog-edness of the world is coming for them. I have precious little time to prepare them, to equip them, and to help them find happiness in the midst of it. </p><p>I need them to learn to do their best. I am not convinced they can be happy without it. </p><p>I feel inadequate. I don't know what I'm doing at all. Being autistic makes it very hard to be a good parent in some crucial ways. I can understand the structure of things, but I can't help people see that structure, be motivated by it, etc. My lack of resources, social capital, and network for nepotism, etc. does my children no favors either. Now, only the elite of the lower class by luck, absurd planning, and a ridiculous work ethic will have a chance at any mobility. The social status is irrelevant, except insofar as it affects my children's quality of life. The odds are very much against us.</p><p>They are paying for my mistakes, the mistakes of my biological donors, and the cascade of mistakes of society at large. I can only do my best at this point. That is the only stoic option left.</p><hr><h2 class="">What are you going to do about what happened?</h2><p>It's a time of transition, yet again. We will continue to shape our parenting to their needs given out context. We'll do whatever it takes. </p></div>
