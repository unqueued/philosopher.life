<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>To h0p3,</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response! I've been swamped. I'm going to respond in chunks:</p><blockquote><p>Your post on Adventure Time made me smile. I'm not sure what it is, but cartoons tend to be among my favorite style/kinds of shows; they're consistently worth rewatching to me.</p></blockquote><p>I love cartoons, animation, and comics. I agree that they are worth re-watching. I've been slowly working to catch up on <strong>Adventure Time</strong>, and am looking forward to doing the same with <strong>Steven Universe</strong>. I recently re-watched much of <strong>Batman: The Animated Series</strong>, I was shocked with how well it held up. It is a remarkable show.</p><blockquote><p>I am curious about your Song as wiki claim. I love Music and wikis, but I fear I'm missing your point.</p></blockquote><p>I think my post may have made it sound more philosophical than intended. It was more of a comment on form, than anything else. I've been listening to a lot of music which heavily feature sampling other songs. I've been listening to one song, and then listening to as many of the songs the initial song sampled as I can find.</p><blockquote><p>I am sorry I frightened you. You are right: people are unpredictable. I appreciate your willingness to watch, think, and speak again. I've clearly been wrong about you. I'm sorry.</p></blockquote><p>No apologies necessary, but thank you kindly. It is much appreciated.</p><blockquote><p>Anarchism is a word like Liberal in that it has many definitions. What do you mean by anarchism? When you are an anarchist, what kind are you? When you aren't, what are you, and why?</p></blockquote><p>Anarchism is most certainly a word with a more solid definition than I invoke when I use it. I agree with the two flavors you described, but I think my use of the word may be sloppy.</p><p>I appreciate your asking me more specifically what I mean by anarchism. I've been thinking about it.</p><p>I guess it boils down to, I believe that if people in general were &quot;good&quot; (that is itself a hairy subject) then we could all be trusted to do our own good, with and for each other.</p><p>‚Ä¶I preemptively apologies for my sloppiness here. I'll continue to think on this.</p><p>Biopower.</p><p>I must admit I am by no means an expert ‚Äî you seem to know much more than I. I brought it up because I've been thinking about it in the context of the internet, and gatekeepers to the internet. How this power effects folks, and is wielded.</p><p>I'll do some more work here, though, and keep thinking it through.</p><p>More soon,</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Eli</p></div>
