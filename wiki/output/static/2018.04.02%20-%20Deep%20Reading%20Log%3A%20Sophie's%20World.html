In part, as well, I hope to have an 'easy' book to enjoy with my wife, a fiction novel might just have the right makeup for enjoyment. Further, this book may be a good introduction for my children. I don't want to force it upon them too early (although, inescapably, we're engaged in philosophical reasoning every day). </p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_World" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_World</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/sophie-s-world-in-danger-living-as-though-everything-centres-on-our-time-is-just-as-naive-as-a6685241.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/sophie-s-world-in-danger-living-as-though-everything-centres-on-our-time-is-just-as-naive-as-a6685241.html</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/25/books/hooked-on-philosophy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/25/books/hooked-on-philosophy.html</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.prolificliving.com/jostein-gaarder-sophies-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.prolificliving.com/jostein-gaarder-sophies-world/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.gradesaver.com/sophies-world" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.gradesaver.com/sophies-world</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.enotes.com/topics/sophies-world" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.enotes.com/topics/sophies-world</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://theautarkist.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/a-review-of-sophies-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://theautarkist.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/a-review-of-sophies-world/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sophie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sophie/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://theriault.wikia.com/wiki/Sophie%27s_World" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://theriault.wikia.com/wiki/Sophie%27s_World</a></li></ul><p>This book isn't meant for me. I have studied the original works, and I've seen at least a sketch of the history of philosophy. I have strong opinions about these people and their ideas. I'm not here to be blown away or cut my teeth. I assume this is a pleasurable stroll. My goal is not be overly critical and just go with the flow. I am curious. I don't know what to say. </p><p>The actual fictional part may be the most confusing part of it to me.</p><hr><p>[Dictated by Computer]</p><p>Cat's name is lovely. My wife is going to like that.</p><p>I like that we're slapped in the face with a reflection. It becomes more interesting if we realize that we should be unhappy with our appearance or the appearance of things. In many ways philosophy is concerned with finding the least deceptive appearance.</p><p>I think what's more interesting than the question &quot;where does the world come from?&quot; is the question &quot;what is the world?&quot; The author clearly realizes this, but he asks it incorrectly, imho. Perhaps this is a translation error.</p><p>It seems to me the philosophy is curiosity about salient curiosity. Breaking the habit of certainty at the right time, in the right way, for the right reasons, and so on. Philosophers are like thin-skinned children currently astonished by the enigma of the world.</p><p>Despite what I've heard from conservative philosophers I have found: drug usage is actually extremely useful to doing philosophy well. You aren't in a position to appreciate phenomenology well enough without it. There are qualia factors involved likely. There is also the personality and psychological changes in openness that is necessary (but not sufficient) for redpilling. I strongly suggest psychedelics.</p><p>I mean much of philosophy has to do with figuring out what doesn't simply boil down to the stories we tell ourselves, finding what is more than mere perception, but is in fact objective truth or transcends subjectivity. The Descartesian Rationalists, in their subversions that led to the primacy of Epistemology over Ontology, really understood the core first step.</p><p>Heraclitus (there is only change) and Parmenides (that nothing changes) are doing ontology that we've never really escaped. We keep re-telling both their stories, trying to force them together, etc.</p><p>This book is attempting to string The Great Human Conversational together too nicely, neatly, quickly, etc.</p><hr><h2 class="">For my own work:</h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> is that something which comes from nothing.</p><p>I think the basic substance of reality is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Meaning.html">Meaning</a>. Whatever meaning means, it describes, defines, calculates, expresses, and &quot;means&quot; itself. How this substance changes into its various modes of being is not something I'm obligated to describe (nor am I convinced that we ever fully can).</p><p>If change obtains, and substance cannot account for it, then what is it? I think for something &quot;to be&quot; or &quot;not to be&quot; is separate from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Meaning.html">Meaning</a>, or somehow only a part of it. Thus, I think there are two fundamental things. I suggest that The Being of Meaning and The Meaning of Being are necessarily intertwined. It is possible they can't actually be peeled apart. I do not know.</p><p>Algorithms are the rules, sequence of change. Data is that substrate which is changed; that which either exists or does not. This is the Ontological Dialectic. Without both, there would be no meaning: no computation.</p><p>Does the algorithm change? Insofar as an Algorithm can be changed, it is data. It can always be represented in data. It seems that there are axioms of change. </p><p>Nothing comes from nothing. If <em>Nothing</em> were to be a <em>thing</em>, only <em>Nothing</em> can come of it. In fact, only X can come from X. But, why does X+Y produce more than X+Y? We never really get off the ground. For each thing, then, there is. It seems then, there is &quot;being&quot; and &quot;non-being,&quot; states of one substance: data. Algorithms, therefore, are a substance. </p><p>At least some minimal set of axioms comprise the meaning of the world. </p><p>I suggest that data is the substrate. It just is being and non-being, 0 and 1's. But, it seems we could also just say there is non-being, 0 (thus we demonstrate a being of non-being) and 1. </p><p>Underneath this we have true metaphysics: that which cannot be conceived, absurd, the impossible, bottom. There are turtles all the way down, but perhaps when it becomes absurd to think there is another turtle below it, for that phenomenological perspective of person, you have reached metaphysics. </p><p>I'm very interested in positing the bare minimum, but I don't feel it necessary to posit more. That isn't the claim that minimal answers are the ultimate truth, but we can at least say they aspects of the complete answers in which we are most certain or confident. </p><hr><h2 class="">Back to the book:</h2></div>
