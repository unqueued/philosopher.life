I enjoy Ashes; it's pretty different than what I'm used to playing and I know I'm not good but maybe I'll get a liiiittle better at it over time haha
DEC 26, 2018 1:03 AM
My college friends had very strong opinions about Dominion - the two who played magic and one who played other board/card games all played it once without me, hated it, and refused to play it with me XD
DEC 26, 2018 1:05 AM
once I finally played, I enjoyed it -- and the person I played with had a lot of the expansions so we pretty quickly added those in, and I still enjoyed it.
DEC 26, 2018 1:05 AM
I mostly played Ascension single player against the AI on my phone (I'm not convinced it's a good IRL card game because there's soooo much annoying shuffling and fiddly pieces, especially with later expansions). There were several decks that you could built to go infinite against the AI (draw your whole deck, take another turn, repeat) and I quite enjoyed that...but it definitely didn't teach me about playing other people XD
DEC 26, 2018 1:07 AM
I hear you on learning games. It seems to be a definite skill to me - one of my college friends was just incredible at memorizing card text and recalling it simply based on card art - obviously a necessary skill for watching magic streams - and I think that's largely a trained skill. I can see myself getting better at it over time as I've played more of those sorts of games (though I'm still nowhere as good as he is, and my memory fades pretty dramatically if I don't play regularly).
DEC 26, 2018 1:10 AM
Generally I think the overall rules and strategies and concepts seem to broadly apply to deckbuilding/collectable/strategic card games, so being good at one makes it easier to be good at the rest of them.
DEC 26, 2018 1:11 AM
I didn't play magic until college either. I wish I had started younger and got it out my system earlier. I remember seeing it when I was much younger and thought it was dumb (in alpha/beta it WAS dumb).
DEC 26, 2018 4:38 PM
I'm still in the process of defining why I like games, their purpose, and what a game really even is (though, I've been at this for a long time).
DEC 26, 2018 4:38 PM
I'm sure you would be an excellent player of any of these games if you chose to pour yourself into it (which is not my recommendation, lol).
DEC 26, 2018 4:39 PM
I have strong opinions about Dominion too (come from MTG)! Whoever designed it is clearly brilliant, even if the vanilla is broken (I've yet to play expansions, but I have opinions about it). It is a game I've not formally studied, but I am indirectly connected to people who have.
DEC 26, 2018 4:40 PM
I played against AI in league forever, and I wish I played against people from the beginning.
DEC 26, 2018 4:41 PM
I think it taught me all wrong (but, there is something literally wrong with my brain that makes it so I cannot see/model the entire gamestate correctly...in single lane [like ARAM] I am radically better at thegame).
DEC 26, 2018 4:41 PM
I love going infinite in games! I love to see the boundaries and cracks in the mechanics.
DEC 26, 2018 4:42 PM
Imho, though I am not an expert in learning games (I have one friend who I consider to be that good though; he's a very obsessive man), I think memorizing/recall is much weaker than understanding the ludology and forming excellent principles about the game. Connecting those dots are what make a good player, imho.
DEC 26, 2018 4:43 PM
To use Magic as an example, I don't know any of the cards printed in the past 5 years, but I could walk up to the Standard metagame and play it competitively (though not enough to handle the legit full-time professionals) within 2 days of heavy practice and scouting because the core principles of construction and reasoning about the cards remain the same (even when the card mechanics and metagames shift).
DEC 26, 2018 4:45 PM
I like to think that Computer Science is similar. The algorithm is matters more than the language or framework of the day you program it in.
DEC 26, 2018 4:47 PM
I'm not competent enough to say that is true though.
DEC 26, 2018 4:47 PM
So, yeah, I agree with your conclusion a lot, especially since all the cards games seem to be variations of one another so far.
DEC 26, 2018 4:49 PM
I would be interested to see a card game which completely broke away from that set of mechanics. I have no idea what it would look like.
