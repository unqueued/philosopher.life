 I bought a busted Honda xr200 from some crack heads awhile back. Hoping for a quick flip. Ended up engine was not repairable. So I bought a brand new Honda clone and ran this as a dirt bike for awhile. But grew bor d with it. This is where I'm going next. I'm digging it
8 hours ago
 How you doing man?
8 hours ago
 Doing well enough. Sleep deprivation is getting to me.
8 hours ago
 Working hard on a letter.

 Searching for an answer to the crisis of capitalism. It's not fun to think about.
8 hours ago
 I think the crisis is people. And their appalling disregard for their fellow humans. On small and large scale.
8 hours ago
 No doubt.
8 hours ago
 Capitolism, socialism, communism would all function. But corruption, hate, greed all screw it up. I don't know that any system can regulate or legislate those inheritly bad traits out of people.
8 hours ago
 Buts that's my cheap ass 2cents. Lol
8 hours ago
 I can appreciate not knowing the answer. It's up to each of us to find one though.
8 hours ago
 I agree to the description of humans as being profoundly selfish, but I don't think that entails the prescription we should. I legitimately think there is a sliver of a chance that we could be better.
8 hours ago
 It turns out that in perfectly competitive markets, Tit for Tat is the best strategy for homo economicus. But, it is up to us if we are really going to be in perfect competition.
8 hours ago
 Tit for Two Tats (The Golden Rule) is the best strategy when enough people are playing it.

 I would have to read up on what you mean by that. I'm on my lawn mower right now. Lol. I will have to educate myself.
8 hours ago
 Your still a fag tho. Hahah
8 hours ago
 ROFL =)
8 hours ago
 Yupp reading your wiki page reminds me your a fag. Hahah

 Soyboi cuck confirmed. Lol.

 I had to weld the main mount on my lawn mower deck last night. Got it fixed. And I sware half Wal thru mowing the drive belt burns through the idler pully. I can't win for losing.
7 hours ago
 What do you weld with?

 Also going camping tonight for vintage camper weekend. And have to make two trips. Camper, then pack to pick up my vintages truck and the golf cart. There just aren't enough hours in the day. I've been living off energy drinks for years now. I don't have time to read books, write, or play guitar. But I manage to work on a few projects that keep me going and when complete become assets than can be liquidated.
7 hours ago
 Just a cheap Flux core harbor freight welder.
7 hours ago
 It works for the little stuff I do. It can be a pain, the gasless Flux core stuff. It is ugly, but you can get good tack holds.
7 hours ago
 Not really good for running a clean owner rating bead.
7 hours ago
 Clean *penetraiting

 I don't mean to take you task, but it seems like  could read books if you really wanted to.
7 hours ago
 Your commutes should buy you 10 hours a week, right?
7 hours ago
 Do you absolutely have to to do the other projects for survive?
7 hours ago
 I understand life is busy (I feel that pressure)
7 hours ago
 Seems like you do have the choice to me.
7 hours ago
 I don't disagree. I could read. I think I get more mental stimulation and pleasure out of working my projects than a book would provide.
7 hours ago
 I can appreciate hedonism and pursuing aesthetic excitement.
7 hours ago
 I think eudaimonia, happiness as flourishing, might be a richer notion than pleasure.
7 hours ago
 Did you watch The Matrix?
7 hours ago
 Sure.
7 hours ago
 Remember Cypher's Choice, where he elects to go back into the experience machine?
7 hours ago
 Yeah
7 hours ago
 Which choice would you make in his position, and why?
7 hours ago
 Do you think that those who awaken from The Matrix feel like part of the lives they were leading inside the experience machine were lies, invalid, or somehow incomplete in a meaningful way?
7 hours ago
 Reality is perspective to the individual, but I do believe their is an absolute truth. I just have no desire in my life to presue that. I feel I have enough of both and want to remain positioned to tackle either. But not a full participant in either.
7 hours ago
 Why read book when you should be practicing your shooting skills?
7 hours ago
 Lol
7 hours ago
 You didn't answer my questions.
7 hours ago
 It's a sci-fi what if question that I don't believe carries merit in the world we live in.
7 hours ago
 Is ignorance really bliss? That is the question and if it is are those that are ignorant validated in their existence.
7 hours ago
 Yes, hypotheticals, thought-experiments, and science fiction tend not to have merit in the real world...right? =)
7 hours ago
 When you ask &quot;what really matters?&quot; or &quot;what ought I do?&quot; or &quot;what is value?&quot; - you are going to have be forced to think in an abstract sense.
7 hours ago
 I think you'd choose to live in The Matrix, from the sounds of it.
7 hours ago
 Of course, what is the &quot;world we live in&quot; becomes an irrelevant question on such a claim.
7 hours ago
 Probabaly. Depends on in which location have the best girlfriend... Hahaha
