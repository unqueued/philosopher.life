<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>We got there and did almost nothing. We put together the light from last week, put up a junction box to the pole we were
connecting to, and did the wiring we could. We can't actually do the wire-up because we can't turn the poweroff yet. I'm not
sure what we'll be doing about that, especially after we found out that they guests in that cabin will be there all week. Not
my problem though.</p><p>Colton attempted to bait us with the possibility that if we finished up quickly here we'd be able to go on another job with
him that makes even more money. This is obviously bullshit, although I did not indicate that.</p><p>We sat around most of the morning waiting for Colton to figure out what he wanted to do.</p><p>We got some ditches dug, some pipe layed, and it was raining hard. We took two timeouts on work because it was raining hard
enough.</p><p>I ate lunch with my boss. We clearly have nothing in common. I am not surprised to learn he is a native Texan (although, his
accent does not strongly give it away, minus the bravado in his tone).</p><p>By the end of the day, Colton was telling us we could &quot;leave early&quot; (at 3) if we got the lights up (which he had said earlier, we weren't even going ot try). He's truly a piece of shit.</p><p>At 5:30, I told him I had to go. I'm done working and not getting paid for it. He can suck my dick.</p><p>I did have an interesting conversation with Bryan. He had offered to bring me in on some moonlighting before. I gave him my counteroffer (with socialist reasoning); he makes $30/hour and I $10/hour, and we split the profits (this deal being made on the assumption that there will profits to share).</p></div>
