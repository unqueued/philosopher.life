SAT 7:16 PM
[[L]], how are you doing, grill?
SAT 7:16 PM
How goes it? =)
SUN 12:30 PM
Hey! It goes well enough. [[K]] is officially done with school and work for the semester and is enjoying his time off. Things have slowed down at work while we wait for our impending doom AKA my boss‚Äô boss coming back from maternity leave.
SUN 12:32 PM
Good!
SUN 12:32 PM
I'm glad life has slowed down quite a bit for you guys. You could use the break.
SUN 12:32 PM
Agreed... we did absolutely nothing yesterday but okay video games. It was a novel experience.
SUN 12:33 PM
Lol.
SUN 12:33 PM
I‚Äôve forgotten how nice it is to just be a potato every once and awhile.
SUN 12:33 PM
Potatoes gonna potate
SUN 12:34 PM
What games you play?
SUN 12:34 PM
lol... mostly FFXIV, the mmorpg
SUN 12:34 PM
Been falling behind cause I‚Äôve been so busy, so it was nice to have a chance to catch up.
SUN 12:35 PM
Noice.
SUN 12:35 PM
Ever tried botting in the game?
SUN 12:35 PM
Very very hard to on PS4 lol
SUN 12:35 PM
Yes...we must draw up the plans for the lego contraption that pushes all the buttons in the right sequence.
SUN 12:36 PM
But no, I like to take it easy. I don‚Äôt mind the grind.
SUN 12:36 PM
lol!!
SUN 12:36 PM
[[K]] played FFX, and is still playing right now lol
SUN 12:37 PM
Apparently in this remake they added stuff he didn‚Äôt know about and he died out of nowhere. Poor guy.
SUN 12:38 PM
Is he completionist about these games?
SUN 12:39 PM
Most definitely.
SUN 12:39 PM
He‚Äôs working on grinding out the ultimate weapons right now, apparently?
SUN 12:39 PM
I bet those are the kinds of the players the devs love to love or love to hate (strong opinions either way)
SUN 12:39 PM
Hehe, yeah...
SUN 12:40 PM
Gotta minmax: it's the only correct way to tell yourself the story through the experience state machine
SUN 12:40 PM
Square Enix seems to encourage the grinding/full clear honestly.
SUN 12:40 PM
Hehe
SUN 12:41 PM
Lineage 2 was one of the grindiest games I ever played.
SUN 12:41 PM
[[K]] is good about making a plan when he plays his games. He sets out to do a thing and then does it.
SUN 12:41 PM
Truly teleological.
SUN 12:41 PM
I‚Äôm usually just there for the story. I‚Äôm better about grinding now than I used to be, but I very rarely make a plan.
SUN 12:41 PM
Well, story and atmosphere and puzzles...
SUN 12:42 PM
I think [[j3d1h]] is similar
SUN 12:42 PM
I do my best to connect with her on those points.
SUN 12:42 PM
Ooooh
SUN 12:43 PM
A fellow ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy to be here‚Äù hehe
SUN 12:43 PM
Aye, with heavy RPing, interest in the lore, and perhaps a meta approach to the community and their goals.
SUN 12:44 PM
Been playing Magic over Cockatrice with the kids. I think [[1uxb0x]] enjoys my style of gaming more.
SUN 12:44 PM
I could see that
SUN 1:12 PM
I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised either ‚Äî he seems to play his resource games very carefully and planned out
SUN 1:14 PM
Yes!
SUN 1:14 PM
I hope I can teach him a great deal through this medium.
SUN 1:14 PM
We've each been keeping logs of our games and reasoning about it in ours wikis.
SUN 1:14 PM
Ooooh
SUN 1:14 PM
Originally, we were just playing against each other (which important), but I have taken to coaching each of them (1 game each per day).
SUN 1:15 PM
The dots connect like lightning in my son!
SUN 1:15 PM
Hehe
SUN 1:16 PM
He‚Äôs a strategist for sure. ‚ÄúIf this then that‚Äù is a strong skill to have for magic... one I‚Äôm bad at. XD
SUN 1:16 PM
I bet you are good at it. I think you just don't enjoy that kind of grind.
SUN 1:16 PM
That‚Äôs it mostly
SUN 1:17 PM
Climbing the ladder of inferences, training for yourself to see the decision trees, etc. Strategy is the ludological grind.
SUN 1:17 PM
I think older me is getting more comfortable with the grind though. Younger [[L]] saw it as annoying, now I see it more as a ‚Äúnecessary evil‚Äù
SUN 1:19 PM
Not that it is evil, just that I mentally hiss at it less than I used to lol. Age is making me more patient I guess.
SUN 1:19 PM
Embracing the grind might be a kind of zen thing. You get in the ready-to-hand mode, in the zone, a kind of weak flowstate, where you don't even really have to think about what you are doing, you just do it.
SUN 1:21 PM
Exactly
SUN 1:22 PM
Just like work.... lol
SUN 1:22 PM
You spend our very identities and autonomy on these practices. We are no longer asking &quot;what should I do?&quot; or &quot;why should I do this?&quot; -- I am not against the denial of self accomplished [[irwartfrr]].
SUN 1:23 PM
We spend*
SUN 1:23 PM
I like grinding too!
SUN 1:23 PM
It puts me in a passive observer state, in a sense.
SUN 1:24 PM
Hmmm... I wonder if that‚Äôs why I never liked the grind ‚Äî I prefer to be an active observer.
SUN 1:25 PM
I think it‚Äôs why I have trouble sitting still. Ever.
SUN 1:25 PM
Active grinding might just be what autonomy is about. It is where we compute about (and modify) how we are going to compute. It is the present-at-hand mode. The mode where is there is a problem to consciously solve. We must step back and wrestle with it.
SUN 1:27 PM
I think that is a far more exhausting (though often more rewarding) process.
