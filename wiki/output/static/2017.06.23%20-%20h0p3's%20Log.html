<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">How is your health? Daily routine? </h2><p>I'm doing well. I'm probably eating too much, and I'm having odd dreams. Also, I've noticed tingling sensations in my feet at night. I think it has something to do with how I'm laying at night. That's a bad sign. I have terrible circulation. </p><p>I've been experiencing plenty of thought loops. </p><hr><h2 class="">What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?</h2><p>I'm feeling anxious about my &quot;next step.&quot; I feel a bit like I'm in limbo like I don't have a solid gameplan like I don't know where I am going, and I feel like I'm under significant pressure to know immediately.</p><p>Finding work hasn't been easy. I feel like electricians, mechanics, and welders have an easier time finding a job. I still have options. I'm not in an insane rush. But, our car isn't doing well. We have money, but it dwindles. </p><hr><h2 class="">Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself.</h2><p>I still don't have a solid grasp of this economic landscape. I don't know how things work. I'm still learning. I do have time to learn. It's okay to feel anxious! Use it as a motivational tool. Keep working hard!</p><p>It's important to maintain empathy for those around you while particularly the ones you love.</p><p>Welders either have the certs and can weld, or they can't at all. It's binary. In a way, you practice before you can, and then it floods in on you. It's also the only skill that I can practice on my own at home (once I get a machine). The others require a kind of field experience which one doesn't merely pick up in isolation. I feel like welding should be the art I learn on the side, even if it I may end up doing it for a living. But, I may be wrong! It seems to be the area I have the most to learn in right now.</p><hr><h2 class="">What are you going to do about what happened?</h2><ul><li>I will continue to try and get my Ethereum account back. I have a significant amount of money sitting in there. It was a very wise investment. Admittedly, I feel like it is too early to take it out still. But, we could use it!</li><li>I will apply to the electrician's union.</li><li>I will apply the boiler maker's union.</li><li>I'll keep pushing in my welding. <ul><li>I need to practice making roots.</li></ul></li></ul></div>
