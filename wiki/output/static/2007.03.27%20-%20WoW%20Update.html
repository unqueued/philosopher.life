<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Yeah. I’m getting tired of WoW. Who would’ve thunk it? I see that Blizzard will never adjust the game correctly. We are mere mortals after all..but you’d they think could have done a better job than.. that (/point)…atleast!! Imbalance is terrible. Itemization is now reaching that threshold of utility where you either have it or you don’t–I.E. skill has diminishing returns, or even worse, isn’t necessary.</p><p>The lock, eh, he does pwn hard. He isn’t a rogue though. Once you go stealth+stunlock, you never go back. Mind you, I’ve chosen to go for the awful 30/0/31. I’m lacking imp gouge, some camo/mod, and deadliness (ouch!)–but I can still hemo-stunlock. Eh, I stick to daggers though. It is hilarious to just premed-Ambush-CB-Evisc when the time comes. Countless times I’ll remove that pesky healer from the group, and we take them down because I broke their matrix. I feel like the other part of a rogue in this build…not so much control (albeit, I still have it when I need it), but burst.</p><p>1v1 is nearly gone (and that saddens me). I hate losing because someone else screws up in group. I have had 10x the skill of the combined opposing team, and we still lose because a.) skill doesn’t mean everything in a gear and class-config’d game and b.) skill isn’t calculated fairly in the group v. group equation (not that it is fair in 1v1 either). Whatever.</p><p>The worst part is that I’d love to play with Allen…but he really doesn’t have what it takes (no worries, I know he doesn’t read this blog, I’m TL;DR for him, and he is “so” busy, lol). He is absolutely terrible at video games, and his rogue, which requires a buttload of skill to actually perform decently, is no exception. He is such a combat rogue at heart…I.e. a zerg it down warrior-type that wants to play as a brainless zombie.</p><p>Now, certainly I am patient with the inexperienced. I’ve taught countless rogues howto stunlock or take particular classes. I’ve taught some so well that I never have a chance if they open (which is saying something in TBC, because I never get 100 to 0′d anymore), regardless of gear. But, Allen will never learn, and he will never be good. Allen doesn’t have the will or way to learn. Seriously, he’s slow both mentally and physically. It requires a great deal of effort, and honestly, usually he’s too lazy or full of pride to sit down learn and execute what is best. (He was the same in EQ)</p><p>“Storyline” *sigh…He doesn’t play a game. I somehow wish he didn’t enjoy the narrative, mostly because–the narrative is stupid and childish. If you were 6, then I’d say, yeah, go for it. But at 23, you should be mature enough to not be sucked in by the lameness of the “storyline”. Play the game to win, simple.</p><p>Oddly, this sort of rant probably is against most all players of this “game”…I’m tired of being surrounded by incompetent fools (not just in the game either).</p><p>Unfortunately, Ebay doesn’t want me selling intangible goods. Yikes. Where can I sell it then?</p></div>
