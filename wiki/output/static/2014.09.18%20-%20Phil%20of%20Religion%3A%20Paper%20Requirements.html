<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The paper is due October 6th.</p><p>You must submit both a print copy and a digital copy (used to check for plagiarism).</p><p>Papers will be 5-6 pages, double-spaced, no added space between paragraphs, using size-11 or 12 font Times New Romans, with 1‚Äù margins, pagination, in .docx formatting. Both a Title page and Bibliography are required (these aren‚Äôt included in the 5-6 page count).</p><p>Find an argument in the literature of this class which you think, from a philosophical perspective, is wrong, misguided, or lacking something important. I‚Äôd prefer you chose something you were passionate about. More importantly, you need to choose something for which you have (or will have) a good, opposing, philosophical argument. We‚Äôre not here to do scriptural exegesis or theology; you need to provide strictly philosophical reasons for why your opponent‚Äôs point of view is incorrect. You can write about any of the articles on the Concept and Attributes of God (see your syllabus), even the Rowe and Wierenga pieces we haven‚Äôt encountered yet.</p><p>Assume I am familiar with the target paper, its context, and whatever background is necessary. This is generally not the case in philosophical writing, but I don‚Äôt want you to waste our time with a fa√ßade. I want a bare-bones introduction, with no frills. Get to the point, and just tell me the argument, and what‚Äôs wrong it.</p><p>Spend 1-2 pages on exegesis: explain the argument. Your exegesis should be a very crisp, well-rehearsed, concise explanation of your target‚Äôs views. Use citations, and only use quotes when necessary (I‚Äôd avoid them, since you have so little space to work with). Do not strawman; be charitable. In your exegesis, do not import your own ideas or notions unless you are forced to fill in gaps of the target argument, and if you do, then explicitly state it! Make your target‚Äôs view look good, and do it in a compact way. If you can‚Äôt quickly and effectively summarize the material, that may indicate to me that you don‚Äôt have a mastery of it.</p><p>Spend 2-3 pages addressing a flaw in the argument. After you‚Äôve made their view look good, then you need to demonstrate a problem with the target view. This should be well-crafted, and it must point out a significant flaw. That flaw may cascade into lots of problems. Point out the implications of the flaw.</p><p>Lastly, spend a bit of time providing a charitable interpretation of how your target would respond and argue against your claim. Is there a way out for your target? In attempting to construct a rebuttal to your claim, you will be showing me that you have a mastery of the general perspective your target brings to the table, but also an awareness of the weaknesses in your own claim.</p><p>If I had you write a 10-12 page paper, I think a significant portion of some of your papers would be filler. That‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôve narrowed the page count to a mere 5-6 pages. Don‚Äôt be mistaken in thinking this is easier than writing a 10-12 page paper. It‚Äôs much easier to explain something in 10-12 pages than to explain the exact same thing in 5-6. I expect excellent short papers. In fact, I suggest writing a 10-12 page paper, and work on reducing it down to a 5-6 page paper. No filler. I want it to be action packed. Every word counts. If you can say the same thing in fewer words, then do so.</p><p>I expect it will be hard to get an A on these papers. But that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve designed the class with that in mind. 30% of your grade comes from raw participation (which is an obscene amount), so you can still make an A in this class even if your papers are perfect. I‚Äôll grade this midterm paper easier than the final paper.</p></div>
