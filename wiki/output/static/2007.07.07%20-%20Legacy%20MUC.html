<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>As the relevance and power of your counter-base deceases in relation to the tempo of your opponent’s relevant threatbase (or as the fundamental turn of the format becomes faster and faster), the more MUC becomes reliant upon tempo-type control features. Generally, the earlier a control piece can be played, the weaker it is comparatively to a later game control piece (often with diminishing returns as you scale down, with few exceptions like FoW). The mana to degree of effective to control should certainly scale, and often there are large, even disproportionate, sacrifices made to have free, cheap, and early counters and control. This means that Force Spike is obviously not as good as Mana Leak, except in circumstances in which the tempo of the game is so fast that your only shot to relevantly control the game with permission requires you to “down-grade” in both scale and often proportionate mana to control effectiveness.</p><p>At some point, MUC can no longer counter every threat and continue to generate card advantage. Obviously, eternal formats have evolved to the point that MUC doesn’t even consider it possible to counter all possible threats. Thus, MUC is forced into board control. Board control generally boils down to either permanent removal or bounce (both serve different functions), but essentially they both help MUC bridge the tempo gap. Bounce is the cheapest and most versatile form of removal, but it is quite temporary. It clearly doesn’t deal with threats in the long-term (and this is quite relevant to a control deck), but it can act as tempo gain (something MUC desperately can use often enough)…practically a timewalk in many cases. Again, bounce is not card-advantage, and thus it is limited and least preferred in true control, but often its versatility is necessary to fill in gaps. Single target permanent removal does exist (splash for STP?). But, again it does not answer the problem of MUC only being capable of so many 1v1 for trades while generating spell-based card advantage. The only good answers comes in the form of mass removal. Massive permanent removal is more expensive, less versatile than bounce and pin-point, but it offers MUC the end result in wants: card advantage with no relevant threats on the board (or in the opponent’s hand).</p><p>To the extent that the counter-base can no longer scale with the tempo of a format, permanent mass board control must substitute. This does mean that MUC is vulnerable because it is often forced to wait to eliminate threats. But, life is a resource, and MUC can certainly use several tempo variables to its advantage to eventually establish control of the game. Legacy’s fundamental turn decreases the relevance and power of a counter-control strategy, thus MUC is forced to win the game not in virtue of controlling exclusively the stack, but also controlling the board. Pin-point removal and bounce do not solve the problem, although they can be used to fill in the gaps between Counters and Mass board controllers.
MUC does remain quite powerful (played correctly). You need to understand your role thoroughly. Mass Board control does offer very strong card advantage, often giving 1 to 3 or more. Some mass board controllers offer continual advantage (which make them extremely powerful), such as Back to Basics and Vedalken Shackles. For MUC to exist (and not become fish), it will need to rely upon mass board control. The most important aspect of board control is that it does what your counter-base can’t do for you while often acting as card advantage like FoF. The more you play MUC in such a fast environment, the more you will come to understand that the tempo of the format decreases the relevance of permission to the point that counters exist to supplement the mass board controllers, not the other way around.</p><p>The deck wins strictly on card advantage, and the principle must be continued for MUC to exist. At any point a blue deck doesn’t attempt to generate true card advantage, and simply disrupt, it is an aggro-tempo deck…Fish. When you build and play MUC for Legacy, it is from the standpoint that you are attempting to resolve and use a mass-board controller. Counters help you live long enough to do that.</p><p>In a fairly slow format you would go: Counter-control -&gt; Stabilize -&gt; Win condition</p><p>Legacy is closer to: Counter-control -&gt; Board Control -&gt; Stabilize -&gt; Win Condition</p><p>Stabilizing is the point at which there are no relevant threats on the board or in the opponents hand and you have relevant card advantage. Of course, cantrips, card-drawing, permission, and even bounce will be used throughout the cycle. The important thing to note (yes, I sound redundant): The general aim of MUC has changed. The job of the Legacy MUC player is to get a board controller into play.
So, the short summary:</p><p>I find the early game cannot be won by MUC. As we cannot counter every single threat and solely use spell-based card advantage (FoF/TFK/AK/etc.), we have to base our card advantage, in part, on board control. Modern MUC is based upon the card advantage created by massive board control. MUC shouldn’t be trying to win the early game by countering every single threat and using pinpoint removal because it can’t. It really seeks to crop the most relevant early game cards from an opponent (buying time), and then drop a card-advantage producing board controller.</p><p>When I play MUC in Legacy, I realize I’m only going to be able to counter 1-2 of the most relevant threats in the first couple turns, and that I’m simply buying time to find the card that gives me actual card advantage while neutralizing board threats. Once I’ve neuatralized the board, I just build up card advantage through FoF and my artifacts, and then flood my opponent with my superior resources.</p><p>With that in mind, after extensive play, this is the artifact-bomb centric MUC I use:</p><p>1 Morphling
1 Meloku</p><p>2 Force Spike
4 ManaLeak
4 Counterspell
4 Force of Will</p><p>3 Vedalken Shackles
3 Nevinyrral’s Disk
3 Echoing Truth</p><p>3 Brainstorm
3 Impulse
4 Fact or Fiction</p><p>3 Quicksand
3 Stalking Stones
4 Polluted Delta
15 Island</p><p>I’ll explain my choices in order of functional relevance.</p><p>Board Control–</p><p>Vedalken Shackles: The MVP of the deck. If you play against a creature deck (with the exception of a reanimator concept), then Shackles is the goto card. It is without question the most potent tool in MUC. I’ve found running 3 to be a minimum, but also optimal number, including a decent cantrip/CA base. There is no substitute for this card. It is all too often so relevant that you might even call this a Vedalken Shackles deck. Despite what some of its critics might say, this card is not too slow for the format. MUC definitely has the tools to live to turns 3, 4, and beyond. With a solid island count (you cannot drop below 16 Island/Fetches) this card can not only begin trading cards immediately and stabilizing, but it also serves as a great win condition.</p><p>I will admit, it takes a great deal of practice to maximally use this card. Assuming you know the rulings about the card’s targeting/resolution, you will constantly need to think about what it can do to change the state of the board, and where you hope to end up with this card. Wonderfully, this card be very powerful in multiples, but I’d argue the 2nd (and especially the 3rd) has diminishing returns.</p><p>Nevinyrral’s Disk: The best board clearer in the game. My testing has pointed me again and again to this classic. Other board clearers either don’t match Nevi’s mana-efficiency or its card advantage and ability to clear ALL relevant board threats (with DSC as the exception). PK and EE are faster, yes, but they do not perform the function of a board clearer well enough. Use your counters and bounce to drop the Nevi’s disk, not your PK/EE to use your counters. This is strict board control and card advantage.</p><p>While initially you would think this conflicts with Shackles, it very rarely does. It will be obvious to you after much testing that both artifact bombs play different roles, and that you’ll be seeking one or the other. Additionally, we have bounce to save our artifacts. And, remember, you can always go: Disk’s ability on the stack, in response (or before you pass priority) Echo your Nevi’s. Yay…</p><p>Echoing Truth: Pound for pound, the best bounce available in Legacy. CoV, Repeal, and Boomerang are powerful as well, but unfortunately, they are not as good. CoV is excellent. It can save your own permanents, and it is very cheap. Unfortunately, it allows your opponent to bounce your relevant board controllers as well, and this is simply unacceptable. Boomerang is solid…hitting a land can be powerful. However, the double UU isn’t always available (no matter what turn it is). The ability to hit land simply isn’t worth the extra U requirement and the inability to hit multiples of the same name. Repeal is probably the next best option to echo. It is a fantastic card, but it can be fairly mana-intensive, which cannot be afforded for this function of the deck. Echo is a solid response to tokens and multiples obviously. It is nicely colored.</p><p>Bounce does give us some breathing room. Sometimes that tempo boost is what MUC needs. This card fills in a lot of gaps. At the worst, it is brainstormable and pitchable to FoW.</p><p>Other consideration: Back to Basics. B2B is a different form of board control, and it certainly acts like a time walk against decks that rely very heavily upon non-basics. In some metagames, it is ridiculously awesome…in others, it is lacking. If an opponent runs enough basics (and many decks do so to avoid Wasteland), then this card isn’t worth the slot or investment. This is a strong sideboard card.</p><p>Permission–No longer is it the primary control feature of the deck. It is the smoothing element that hits nearly everything in a format. These are timewalks. I find 12 is the bare minimum number of counters MUC can run, and 18 is really the maximum. These will last 4-6 counter slots should be based around your metagame.</p><p>Force of Will: No explanation required.</p><p>Counterspell: No explanation required.</p><p>Mana Leak: Mana Leak is strictly superior in the early game to Rune Snag (and probably any of the other available permission options). It is a hardcounter for several turns, and it fills in a permission gap. This is a minimum 2-of…I prefer to see 4 in my testing. Do remember: mana to permission efficiency DOES matter, and mana leak is fairly efficient. It does lose some of its late game, but I find it still useful even on turn 10 all too often.</p><p>Force Spike: The little counter that could. MUC still can have some early game counters left in it (the metagame isn’t Vintage fast). I prefer Force Spike to Daze simply because I can’t afford to miss a land drop, ever. It is brainstorm fodder and pitchable to FoW. You will still be surprised how many times you’ll use it even in the late game.</p><p>Other spells to consider: Delay, Remand, Misdirection, Logic knot (yeah, it can be fairly good), Daze. With the exception of Logic Knot, these counterspells are tempo spells. They are not true always strictly permission unfortunately. This deck needs true permission to eliminate threats. I find Daze would be most playable in general, but the land drop does matter. MisD can also be an fantastically good card against specific decks/cards, but unfortunately, it lacks versatility and all too often just sits in your hand.</p><p>Draw–MUC has access to both card quality and advantage spells, and obviously, it should use them. Ideally, you want to open a hand with a cantrip to guarentee land drops, and you want to mid-game Chain FoF/Cantrip.</p><p>Fact or Fiction: The best card advantage in Legacy. It gives you the choice along the spectrum of card quality and quantity. It has the ability to capitalize off opponent error and the use of the secret knowledge of your hand. This is a 4-of…no question. Chaining FoF’s together is exactly what MUC does in the mid-late game, and it is part of stabilizing.</p><p>Brainstorm: I hated bringing this down to 3. I believe if you run blue, you should be using this card. It is ridiculous, and I’m not even going to take the time to explain the comparative gains of seeing 3 cards. I’ll be honest though, I don’t like to brainstorm without a fetchland. Running 3 means that I’m more likely to have a fetch available. This could easily goto 4, but it would be at the cost of impulse, which is a guarenteed dig.</p><p>Impulse: This card is a brainstorm+fetchland in one. All too often you are just digging for your artifact-bomb. This card does it for you. This also bypasses CotV@1</p><p>The other consideration: Thirst for Knowledge. A powerful, powerful card with the right deck. Add 3-4 Seat of the Synod and CoTV, and I think it is a must run. My build tends to want to dig FOR the artifacts…pitching is not always best. Additionally, Seat does not work well with other disruption pieces (B2B, Nevi’s, EE@0, PK@0), and it can be wastelanded.</p><p>In any case, your mana-base and cantrip/draw engine are connected to each other.</p><p>Creatures–The more and more I play an artifact-centric MUC, the more I find that my creatures are not the best win conditions. Creatures, without question, are the oddest part of MUC. They are dissynergistic with board clearers, they are mana intensive, and they are generally not very powerful in blue. MUC’s win conditions are at their best when their are either free (or not casted during your mainphases, like Stalking Stones), part of the control game plan in the first place (shackles), or allow you to switch between and fill multiple roles.</p><p>I find three relevant creature spells that allow you to do the latter: Morphling, Meloku, Psychatog, and Rainbow Efreet.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is that your creatures exist primarily as a filler to your Shackles, not the other way around. The majority of games should be won on the back of your shackles, not your actual creature spells. Your creature spells should be filling the roles that shackles cannot.</p><p>For now, I don’t feel it is necessary to explain these creatures. It is obvious that they have fairly different functions and are better or worse against different decks. Shackles and Stalking stones do a lot for you, these creatures can be excellent at filling in the niche.</p><p>In addition, I will have to say that my testing has shown Ophidian not worth the slot. It is a great card in the right metagame, but it does not belong in a creature and removal heavy environment like Legacy. When it is active, it is easy to see where this card is just amazing (much like LoA). But, I ask you to look at the less obvious aspect of Phid: the times in which it is not actually better than other cards that could take its slot and the spells that could have been cast instead. To be oversimplistic: I look at it as a choice between Disk and Phid, and I’ll take Disk anyday.</p><p>Mana Base–Always important. Keep it heavy island (shackles), at or above 24 count, and not too heavily fetch based (you still need to drop lands even in mid and late game). In my mind, it is all about the utility of your extra land slots. The slots seem relatively obvious. I could easily see different MUC variations running Wasteland, Seat of the Synod, 6 fetches, 1-of Duals for splashes, and even Winding Canyons. My version keeps it fairly simple.</p><p>The card I don’t like: Chrome Mox. Not only is it terrible in multiples, dies to SO much hate (including your own board clearing), Chrome Mox is card disadvantage, so much of it that it can’t be supported by MUC’s gameplan. It does have synergy with TFK. It does give you 2-mana (bye bye Force Spike). I suggest that this could be a sideboard card in certain matches, but it is strictly awful in too many cases.</p><p>Cards I wanted to see maindeck, but instead went to sideboard:</p><p>Chalice of the Void: This is a hard card not to put in MUC. CotV at 0 and 1 are excellent (game-breaking perhaps against several decks). However, it needs a whole deck to be built around it mainboard. Brainstorm isn’t as good with it, and more importantly, Nevi’s Disk doesn’t interact well with it. CotV also takes up your all important 2-drop (@1), which can be fundamental to MUC’s success. It, unfortunately, is not a versatile card. Testing has shown it to be an amazing card against certain decks, and against others, I’d MUCh rather have a different card.</p><p>If I did run CoTV in MUC, then I’d use a mana-denial theme to create virtual card advantage by eliminating an opponent’s card relevance (uncastable is as good as useless). I’d use this deck:</p><p>1 Morphling
1 Meloku</p><p>4 ManaLeak
4 Counterspell
4 Force of Will</p><p>3 Vedalken Shackles
3 Powder keg
3 Echoing Truth</p><p>2 Back to Basics
4 CotV</p><p>4 Impulse
2 Thirst for Knowledge
4 Fact or Fiction</p><p>2 Quicksand
4 Wasteland
4 Polluted Delta
15 Island</p><p>Back to Basics: Wow. Such an amazing card. How unfortunate that so many decks can play through it. It even hurts MUC’s extra land slots. Depends on the metagame. Unlike CotV, this doesn’t need a deck built around it. It can easily go 2-3 in a deck, just make sure your mana-base does get owned by it. Again, this is just not synergistic with Disk. In the end, I find Disk to be too important to accept a mana-denial theme. All too often CoTV and B2B come down too late to be relevant, and I’ll need to clear the board anyways. Of course, B2B, if it isn’t Main, should be in the sideboard.</p><p>As for the sideboard, I’m not in a position to say how you should tailor yours…If not already maindeck, Tormod’s Crypt, LotV, Crucible, Boseiju, CoTV, B2B, Blasts, misD, and black or white splashes all seem viable in the right circumstances.</p><p>Conclusions:</p><p>Many people think MUC simply lacks good win conditions. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what MUC is doing. It isn’t about jumping the gap from stabilization to win condition, it is about getting to stabiliziation in the first place. You might say that MUC only has a temporary amount of stabilized turns, and that is why you want to be able to so effectively switch roles. If this is the case, I advocate Psychatog. However, I really question whether you stabilized in the first place if the stabilization is really that temporary.</p><p>MUC in Legacy, unfortunately, cannot act like a mana drain powered BBS. MUC must control the game entirely, whether it is through mana-denial/CoTV or board control. My testing has shown the latter to be more effective.</p><p>The Deck is certainly skill intensive. I don’t know of another deck that needs to think so thoroughly through the implications of both decks at the table to make decisions in the early game. It is, unfortunately, one of those decks with a high enough skill minimum (like solidarity) that it is often passed off as unviable simply because a great number of people cannot play the deck correctly.</p><p>The lovely aspect of MUC is that it can compete against nearly everything (given a skilled player). It has tools that are fairly versatile and a gameplan thatmolds around the opponent’s deck. While control decks are definitionally metagame dependant decks, as they seek be to be interactive (in virtue of a more reactive strategy), MUC has more potential to be a more universal control deck than any other control deck I’ve used. It can interact with nearly any deck, and it keeps a generally high level of card quality and advantage against most any archetype. Having relevant and higher card quality and advantage is exactly what wins games, and I’ve found MUC to be plenty viable against the current environment.</p></div>
