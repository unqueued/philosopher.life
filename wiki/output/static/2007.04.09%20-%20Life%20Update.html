<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>1.) Bought a car. 1200 for an Oldsmobile Cutlass (Supreme, oh yeah?) with 110k miles. It idles high, always 1k RPMS higher than it should. Nothing dangerous in that aspect. Although, I think the ABS is on permanently (which it really shouldn't be). I'm thinking it was worth the 1,200.</p><p>2.) k0sh3k got a new doctor. This one takes her seriously and really seems to think there is more to consider that &quot;just being a mom syndrome&quot;. k0sh3k has new med's (which seem to be working so far?) and has a CT scan today.</p><p>3.) j3d1h can drink out of a straw. She shakes her head &quot;no&quot; as well. Seems to be pronouncing sounds that resemble words more than babble.</p><p>4.) JRE came over for his GRE's. He did alright on the test from the sounds of it.</p><p>5.) Still need to fix that bathroom, fix Claudia's car.</p><p>6.) we are going to take care of another family's kid after school while their baby is having surgery in Kosair (yeah, pretty serious).</p><p>7.) Found out there is no spring enrollment for Talbott. Eh, ok. k0sh3k and I will wait a year then. We could use the time I assume.</p><p>8.) Mom should be coming in about 2 months (I'm going to try and find the dates out from her). I think she will be kind enough to take j3d1h for us and let us escape for some R&amp;R.</p><p>9.) Oh yeah, I said we were going to Talbott...this was because we need an education before we goto Thailand. Perfect programs for us there. Will be 10k tuition per year for both k0sh3k and I together‚Äìdirt cheap.</p><p>10.) The organist for Memorial sang high praises of my piano student Caleb Roberts. The kid is pretty serious (as far as his personality)...I knew that kid was cool.</p><p>11.) My back is spasming, it feels very much like what happened to my neck a while back. But, thankfully, it isn't nearly as intense. No passing out, yay!</p><p>12.) A and J (no title required) are forced to find a new place to stay. I don't think the owner of the house will be able to salvage anything. Good luck to both parties.</p><p>13.) Yeah, I hate my church. The Sunday school class is the best thing (and even then, it can be truly lousy...&quot;everything for appearances&quot;). I don't feel satisfied at all in church. I walk into service, and I can smell the stench of hyprocrites. Easter was the worst. On Easter and Christmas we will always have the attendence of the 2-time a year &quot;christians&quot;...these people are half-breeds, they are filth. They are defilers. They are the &quot;good people&quot; who lead the world to confuse Christians with...that trash. All or nothing people. They are less than the unbeliever. I am disgusted to say the least. I sit in silence.</p></div>
