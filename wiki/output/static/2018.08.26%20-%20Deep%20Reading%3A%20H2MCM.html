<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This book is about how to make a complete map of everything you think
for as long as you like.
</p></blockquote><p>My reading of your comments later contradicts this.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Whether that's good or not, I don't know- keeping a map of all your
thoughts has a &quot;freezing&quot; effect on the mind. It takes a lot of
(albeit pleasurable) work, but produces nothing but SIGHT.
</p></blockquote><p>Fascinating. This is actually my initial reaction to first encountering phenomenology. There are some thing which cannot be bracketed without it. It's obvious that we must accept certain axioms for computing our lives, moving forward, etc. There is no practice without already begging the question of it.</p><p>I love that you are stuck on the perceptual issue as well.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If you do the things described in this book, you will be *IMMOBILIZED*
for the duration of your commitment.The immobilization will come on
gradually, but steadily. In the end, you will be incapable of going
somewhere without your cache of notes, and will always want a
pen&amp;paper w/ you. When you do not have pen&amp;paper, you will rely on
complex memory pegging devices, described in &quot;The Memory Book&quot;. You
will NEVER BE WITHOUT RECORD, and you will ALWAYS RECORD.
</p></blockquote><p>Ha! Sometimes this wiki does feel like that. I am bound to it, and it is bound to me. I spend enormous amounts of time on it, but that's fine.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am just SPITTING THIS TEXT OUT. 
</p></blockquote><p>Stream-of-consciousness. I hear that, homie.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>There is also a &quot;structural integrity&quot; to your old thoughts
that will resist change. You may actively not-think certain things,
because it would demand a lot of notekeeping work. 
</p></blockquote><p>I can appreciate that a great deal. I feel like I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to continue evolving it. The wiki's resuability is also key to enabling such refactoring. Yet, I do quietly worry about this problem.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You'll really understand your ideas. And you'll also see
connections that you were never consciously aware of before. You'll
see a structure and a pattern in your life.
</p></blockquote><p>You're talking about philosophy. I totally understand where you are coming from too, imho! I talk about this very issue pretty often.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Make
it's MOC entry really big. Unimportant? Make it small.
</p></blockquote><p>I have some elements of this. This is the kind of thing which you want to do systematically and habits for. Syntactic work like this is somehow quite relevant to quickly making sense out of the jumble.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Abbreviations/Shorthand, and Color...You'll develop shorthands, and you'll want to trust that you can
decypher them later. 
</p></blockquote><p>I do have shorthand in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hlexicon.html">hlexicon</a> and elsewhere. Naming conventions are where it really shines. I want to be able to reference projects quickly. </p><p>Color is something I generally avoid in a sense. I'm colorblind. Colors need to be ridiculously bright. They do something in this wiki though. White text, blue links. Red in the corner for save-checks, and a black background that is easy on my eyes (particularly in the dark).</p><p>I hope I can decipher it later. I don't write for just myself though, and it's already difficult to decipher this monster.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Speed lists are the answer to the demand. Speed lists are vast lists
of simple thoughts- about 1-50 words. Generally around one line.
</p></blockquote><p>I abuse lists pretty hard in this wiki (and in Python). I prefer to be able to nest and give dimension to the content without having to reason too hard about it as well. It's a form of outlining.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You'll have the &quot;GSMOC&quot;- the &quot;Grand Subject Map of
Contents&quot;, whereon you'll see a gigantic map of EVERY THING THAT YOU
THINK ABOUT.
</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, that's something we want.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Now: All this will change. IN THE FUTURE, computers will be the way to
go. But we are not there yet, NOR will we be there in the next 3-5
years. Remember: Even if the computer is fast, you still need software
that won't get in your way.
</p></blockquote><p>I understand your love affair with drawing. The centerpiece of our living room is a chalkboard (and that delicious Hagoromo chalk). I continually point it out again and again in this wiki, words are simply more effective languages than drawings the vast majority of the time. I think the goal is to become someone who can verbalize it. Use your visual skills to organize the verbal! When you can't put words to it effectively enough, that's when you get out the drawing board. When you hit the incompleteness wall, that's when you just fucking point like a caveman.</p><p>I think drawing is fine for prototyping, which is still caveman territory.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>2) Computers will be the SALVATION of this whole system I am
   describing right now.
</p></blockquote><p>I hope I'm starting to hit that point. I don't know. Maybe it differs for each user.</p><p>Also, I adore the walk through the physical mechanics of this system. It's really real that way.</p><p>A lot of these particularities and habits are thoughtful. I think each person almost has to design their own system, but there are clearly some kinds of rules which are fairly universal. </p><p>I wish this book existed for wikis. Become a master wiki user is pretty hard. I'm clearly bad it in crucial ways (I still don't see a use for tags, even though I really really want to!).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I call it &quot;Multi-cat&quot; or &quot;Multiple Categorization.&quot;
It's easy- just put tags. (It baffles me to this day why people who
make computer notebooks DO NOT do this more frequently..! There's all
this notebook software out there, and you STILL have to put a thought
in one place, and one place only..!
</p></blockquote><p>Well, on the tag point, I feel like links reuse and transclusions eliminate a lot of the needs for tags. Add in search, and I'm really stuck. Tags do tell a particular kind of story, similar to how <em>Vault:</em>'s are versioned history narratives that are handpicked. Not everything can or should be 'tagged' into a story though. But, the moment you want to do something by hand, why not just build another tiddler for it?</p><p>I feel like there are functional equivalences here, and I'm just missing the point. I hope to learn some day! Maybe mastery without tags will open some unique floodgates for me when I start to abuse them? Let's hope.</p><p>I'm also very interested to see what long-term memory advantages one might acquire through systematic use of a wiki. I used to have a profoundly good  memory, but it started to dissipate during puberty. Now my memory is tied to specifics, and it's just normal now. The wiki, of course, acts like an external drive for me, but, I hope that having an external drive is something which not only modifies my memory usage behaviors, but in fact modifies my internal memory itself in significant ways. I'm having to guess here, obviously.</p><p>Your discussion (in an interview I read/saw, I forget, ha), of using essentially a ToC in a book cover or referencing other notes and being able to retrieve (which you discuss in the book several times as well so far), suggests you may feel the way about it. Honestly, it reminds me of the weak Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis.</p></div>
