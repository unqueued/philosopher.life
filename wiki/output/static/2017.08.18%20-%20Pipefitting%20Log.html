<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><ul><li>Showed up very early for Chris. <ul><li>Wasn't necessary.</li></ul></li><li>Bear gave Chris and me sausage biscuits this morning. Weird. I should bring candy next week. Everyone likes candy.</li><li>Inverted a spool. I had to convince the others it was possible to do.<ul><li>David repeatedly said thanks and that I was a smart man after I took 3 times to try and convince them of my idea.<ul><li>He was convinced it was impossible to do with 2 90 fittings instead of a fitting and a coupling. </li></ul></li><li>They were very dismissive in the beginning. One by one I convinced them. Chris was first (He has seen me be right in the face of opposition time and time again; he has the integrity to rethink what he believes when I present a reasonable argument, he can be charitable and curious with integrity.). Chris then realized what our pipefitting foreman had been saying all along. I then convinced our journeyman I was right. He decided, after much swearing about not being able to find an answer, to look at my notebook drawing once more. It was obvious to him after he actually looked at it for real. Our welder changed his mind when he saw the journeyman complimenting and apologizing to me. </li><li>Hilariously, since David-M didn't give us (although, later found out the welder heard something about it, but mentioned nothing to us [seemed like he failed to remember it]) specifications on the length of L (or its purpose, etc.), we cut it long. He wanted it shorter. David-M was displeased at first that it didn't fit his initial vision (which he wasn't explicit about), but saw the same principle was used (and would suit all purposes, since we didn't know what it was meant for, so we took a very conservative approach). He seemed okay with it, although he worried it took us too long (he was obviously perturbed that it took this long, and I suspect this makes us all look very bad).<ul><li>David-M asked me (instead of the journeyman) why it wasn't as he had planned. I told him that we didn't know he wanted it short. Why would David-M ask me instead of my journeyman?</li><li>My journeyman ended up apologizing to my foreman, David-M. <ul><li>I ended up apologizing to my journeyman, David-C. I felt bad that he felt bad. It wasn't his fault (even if he is a journeyman), and I know he wants to keep his job and look good in front of the boss. He did not have complete information, but we still delivered.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>We had to break some bricks.<ul><li>I was given the run-around to get into the civ case. Vic said he could and would do it, and then decided he couldn't. He sent me to Dave (David-M), who doesn't have the key (and had sent me in the first place). Why? What does this mean?</li><li>So, instead of the nice chip-hammer, we had a Hilti with a shitty one we got from the toolroom. </li><li>It was fun, easy, and David-C pointed out that I should hit the grout instead. He was right. </li></ul></li><li>I volunteered to help David-M with his surveyor tool. We transferred a bunch of elevation markings with the ancient telescope tool. I want to get one. It is clearly very valuable for certain kinds of construction work. Someone who can bust out surveyor tools on the spot for certain kinds of measurement and markings will be in an incredible spot to be accurate and fast at the same time. He told me to get any tool I found useful that I didn't own. We then spent two days in a row working on it. <ul><li>He hasn't bought one though. That is odd. He says he wants to, but will retire soon anyway (wasn't convinced it was worth it to him?). </li></ul></li><li>We did two different lock-out-tag-outs today. We are starting to be a team that does things. I fucking love that fact. <ul><li>I love group work when everyone is doing their best and is either as good or better than I am at the task. I like competing, and I like learning. Working together makes it fun too. There is a game to play. Try to surround yourself with people who are as good or better than you are at a task. Make friends and mentors.</li></ul></li><li>We demo'd pipe on 234 (Area 4). We need to make space for supports. We keep drawing and preparing tons up. </li><li>I am honestly deeply impressed by some of the facts, problems, and visual reasoning he deals with in depth and on the fly. There are obviously tons of different kinds of skills he employs on this job that I don't yet have much practice in either. It will take significant work to become as good as he is at his job, truly. So far, I believe he is really a master at this (masters make plenty of mistakes, and they aren't infallible). If David-C is a decent starting journeyman, then David-M helps me see just how much of a gap there is between journeyman and master.<ul><li>Unfortunately, it is clear that he doesn't actually care about my safety anymore than is necessary to maintain his job. Whatever maximizes the chances of him maintaining his job is what he will elect. Like the &quot;honest shopkeeper,&quot; his egoism drives him to appear moral. Beware his intentions.</li></ul></li><li>We got to our last 12&quot; pipe for the day .They used a crane with riggers yesterday for the first half. It was obvious to me they needed to use it on the second half. It was not safe otherwise. <ul><li>I said to my crew what I thought, to each of them individually. I told them I felt it wasn't safe. I gave my reasons.<ul><li>It would only be one support holding the entire length. We don't have enough evidence to believe that support can hold that length. We can't trust it.</li><li>We can't safely hold/cradle/catch/rig the pipe chunks that would be cut off. There's no where to tie-off to on the longer portion of the pipe. That entire section would have to be cut literally held/caught, which we don't know we can do (I'm not sure how much pipe a man can handle at that size; I should come up with a quick pipe-weighing method by size of pipe). <ul><li>Say each man can safely move 100 pounds if they have a good grasp of a non-awkward object, what size pipe lengths at each pipe size are safe? Then I can calculate based on my pipe's length whether or not we can do it by hand.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>My welder is crazy (like an ironworker, completely fucking fearless), and wasn't so worried about it (or so it seemed at first). After break, he changed his mind.</li><li>I talked to David-C's mom, Colleen. Her other son is the junior crane operator, and husband the Rigger Foreman.<ul><li>I compliment her son, David-C. I told her about my concern. She agreed (and so did her son). At lunch she spoke to her husband, and David-M all of the sudden had access to a willing Rigger Foreman. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The acetic acid-tainted mist raining from the gigantic chimneys of the silos was quite unpleasant.</li></ul><p>Perhaps I should only use music and type to my family at lunch, no surfing. I need to be aware, present, participate, etc. I should not immerse myself into a virtual world in that case, but instead, inspect the reality around me.</p><p>I should read the schematics at lunch. It would be interesting, and it would be useful. Plus, it is perhaps the only time I can guarantee access to it. It's very hard to get a hold of it otherwise. Perhaps it &quot;looks too good.&quot; I don't know. But, I need to understand it nonetheless.</p></div>
