<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Forget the template. I'm just going to write in here. Contain it. </p><p>It's clear to me that I'm failing my children. I am not effective parenting. They are not growing into people will be happy, and it isn't clear they are happy now. I can't give up, but I tell you, if I could hit the reset button, I would. </p><p>It feels like I can't find a way to fix this. Perhaps my expectations are too high. But, really? I keep lowering them. I have to say, I feel like I have sacrificed my expectations of life so many times in my life. I've given up the ideal so many times, I worry it isn't practical to seek the ideal. </p><p>This sounds like the 30-year change meets Post-Modernism head-on.</p><p>But, I am not giving up on the pursuit of the ideal, pursuit of the Good, just yet. Cannabliss allows me to do it. DCK helps me pursue The Right, and Cannabliss helps me pursue The Good. Cannabliss gives me reasons to live when DCK doesn't and vice versa. Together, they are drug-team which artificially induces the will to live and pursue. </p><p>While cannabliss inhibits motivation for many people, I am convinced it has the opposite effect in it. Cannabliss allows me to change my life, to be the kind of person who is open to it, to having the willpower to be wrong and keep standing up. It's a substance which induces existential courage in me. Am I addicted? You be the judge. It alone may be worthy enough to make my life always worth pursuing, even if only in the Experience Machine.</p><p>I am still trying to find another reason to live. It is clear that I need to do that. If I can't make my children happy, or even if I'm convinced it won't happen, I need to make sure I can at least find other reasons to live. Admittedly, watching my children fail just reminds me of how much I am a failure. I'm so tired of being a failure.</p><p>I have agreed to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Positive%2520Disintegation.html">Positive Disintegation</a>. That is the source of hope, a hope that this pain and suffering is still worth it. Now I sit at the crossroads, yet again. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="The%2520Experience%2520Machine.html">The Experience Machine</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Positive%2520Nihilism.html">Positive Nihilism</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Metamodernism.html">Metamodernism</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="The%2520Dao%2520of%2520G%25C3%25B6del.html">The Dao of G√∂del</a>, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="The%2520Redpill%2520Prescription.html">The Redpill Prescription</a> are the only options. I see them now. </p><p>I have armed my mind, as well as I, can against The Redpill Prescription, but I am still afraid. I h0p3 to escape it since I'm very worried that on that road, the inevitable destination is psychopathy and being ripped into pieces. No matter how brilliantly argued otherwise,  I cannot see that far ahead. Thus, I wish to reserve it as the last option.</p><p>To some degree or another, the other options sit in stark contrast to The Redpill Prescription. That said, we can see relationships between them.</p><p>The Experience Machine &quot;option&quot; is often reliant upon Egoist models, sometimes incompatibilism and others compatibilism, and pursues Happiness as The Good itself. Ah, but what if that ends up in the darkest of The Redpill Prescriptions? </p><p>Positive Nihilism can go any direction you want. Pursue anything because it doesn't matter. It's accepting relativism in the bounds of who we are as individuals. That doesn't mean &quot;anything goes,&quot; but it does mean we need not feel guilty or compelled for any objective reasons. We have the array of skepticisms, so many with merit. Even Kant cannot escape it. Philosophy pulls us away from religion, and even Kant's religious work may ultimately give way to the skeptics. Seems like it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>KIN: I must accept that fact.
</p></blockquote><p>Let us avoid it if we can. The conflict with Kant is very complicating. That said, Kant can always turn around and still get everything he wants out of Positive Nihilism. The goal is The Goodwill, the pursuit of The Right, even if you get to legislate it yourself. Kant can bend that way. The Neo-Kantians are sometimes brilliant.</p><p>Of course, even Positive Nihilism may evolve into The Redpill Prescription.</p><p>Metamodernism may not be much of a solution. It seems to describe the Dialectic of Humanity through this oscillation, the binary stars:</p><ol><li>The logical, skeptical, post-modern (modernism perfected), destructuralizing, destroying metanarratives and metaphysics, rampage monster.</li><li>The emotional, guttural, practical, rationalizing, fallible, romanticized nitwit without the courage or intellectual integrity to see the possibility of anything beyond Metamodernism, lacking the ability to recognize it is just a stage of Human Culture Development (oh, no, it can account for that, you say?)</li></ol><p>I must say, Metamodernism sounds more epistemically prudent than it does alethic. That's what my gut says ;P...how do you know it too doesn't simply go on to justify The Redpill Prescription? The oscillation may swing us that direction. It fights the good fight, but to what end? </p><p>Thus, I am left with the Dao of G√∂del, the End of Ends. The Telos of Telos. The Good of The Good, The Sequitur of Sequiturs. It is the evolution of the memetic concept of God in each person's eyes.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> While the religion is derided, it seems to have something to it to me from time to time. It can just be another version of Positive Nihilism, but it may be the exact opposite sometimes. In that mode, I believe in The Good like the joy one would receive from believing in the God of the Ontological Argument. It is the very concept of Good in itself that Plato, Aristotle, and the Titans of Philosophy have tried to capture. It's like trying to catch the f-ness of the beautiful lightning itself in a bag. It is idealism so strong that you tremble in frisson. The worry is that it is a drug, just another version of The Experience Machine (and obvious, then, not the best possible machine to use, given that standard). </p><p>Most Rational or Justifiable to Least:</p><ol><li>Positive Disintegration</li><li>Positive Nihilism</li><li>The Experience Machine</li><li>Metamodernism</li><li>The Dao of G√∂del</li><li>The Redpill Prescription</li></ol><p>It seems less about RPIN and KIN (although, the threads are still there), and more about this particular Crossroads. At the very least, I simply accept Positive Disintegration. That is part of being h0p3. Thus, my list is really just:</p><ol><li>Positive Nihilism</li><li>The Experience Machine</li><li>Metamodernism</li><li>The Dao of G√∂del</li><li>The Redpill Prescription</li></ol><p>Hmmm...hashtag those things.</p><ol><li>#Whatev...Happiness.</li><li>#Pleasure</li><li>#Pragmatic Construction</li><li>#God</li><li>#Psychopathy</li></ol><p>The fact is that The Redpill descriptively is right too often. The various prescriptions almost always failures. Combined with Incompatibilism, The Redpill can be dangerous. Fighting incompatibilism is key. The Experience Machine becomes an acceptable moral medium on compatibilist grounds. </p><p>Shit. I don't know. Will think more. That said, these all seem like good enough reasons. Each unsavory in its own way, I think. Risks abound. Stoicize that shit. Positive Nihilism is compatible with all of them. This is conceptually intriguing, a strong effect, and yet seemingly workable. It merits inspection and perhaps a choice first. It may prove irrelevant. It implies it does. It is a jumping off point into whatever we want but has no content itself in a way. It is as barren as Virtue Theory is in normative substance.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Are you ready to be dethroned, Paul Tillich?
