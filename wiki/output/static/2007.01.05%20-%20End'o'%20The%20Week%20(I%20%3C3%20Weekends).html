<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I am ready for the it...TGIF, zomgadfagfgasdfasd I'm turning into...one of them. Forget it. Everyone loves Friday, and I don't spend my money bar-hopping on 'teh weedends' or anything stupid. wheww....Anyways, I'll be glad to be going home.</p><p>An update on the Car: we are probably taking it in on Tuesday...probably. The gear-shifting issue is odd: it only happens 1.) in the mornings, 2.) when it is very cold (cold enough to frost the windows). This leads me to believe, a.) my anti-freeze needs to be checked (which will be done asap), or b.) my car needs professional help, the Tuesday variety. We will see. Funny thing, I JUST checked all the fluids a few weeks ago...the right color, the right amount...but eh, I'm hoping it is cheap. *crosses-fingers...as if I believe in luck.</p><p>I'm getting sick myself. No doctor anymore. Unless I feel like I'm dying, I'm not going. I'm a wuss, I can't believe I went because my ears had pain in them (some of them were sharp)...just to find out that I have allergies?...PFFT. What I've got now is...ermm...closer to Bronchitis/Influenza? Not until I'm dying, But, I took a sinus - decongestant excedrin thingy, and many drugs pwn. I feel better in 20 minutes. Not perfect, but doable.</p><p>On a side note: Did you know that there is such thing as &quot;male lactation?&quot; Apparently, a human male can produce milk. Alrighty then.</p><p>WoW: 300 eng, took 2 hours, 170g, and some frustration. It was worth it I assume...now to dig up 700g in mats for the reflectors. Still don't have my HWL OH, but I'll get there. BG's are SO boring. I only need to knock out 12k honor for it. I've decided I won't be upgrading any of my other equipment before TBC, however. My guess: everything is VERY replacable, with exception of eng gear + HWL weapons of course. Being back on a PvP server is fun. I don't meet nearly as many tards....well, not as retarded...most are still tards though. The gear inequities I'm experiencing is quite humbling. I lose matches for trivial things that I wouldn't have problems with if I had even half the gear these people did. I am hoping TBC with be the great equalizer (yay, just like our public education system..oh wait). With everyone new at 70, and probably me being one of the first, we'll be on a more equal playing field. It will be just me vs them...</p><p>MTG: Allen and I are hitting the prerelease on the 20th (I hope). Planar Chaos presents some interesting ideas...although, I wonder if I'm going to be disappointed in the power-level of these cards as I have been since...Kamigawa? Oh well, we'll have fun, and there is always extended/legacy/type 1 (w/proxies).</p><p>1.) idday ouyay owknay atthay Iay otgay inay oubletray orfay itingwray aay ournaljay tryenay urelypay inay igpay atinlay enwhay Iay asway inay econdsay adegray?</p><p>2.) :siht kaerb nac uoy fi eeS .lausu ta krow ta dnuora gniwercs ,nuf gnivah tsuj m'I</p><p>Â 3.)
