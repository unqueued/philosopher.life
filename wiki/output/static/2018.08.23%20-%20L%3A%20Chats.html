 Also, would you read my commentary on the first chapter? I want you to know exactly what I'll be sending your mom and dad.
a day ago
 So, I‚Äôve only made it a portion of the way through your chapter analysis and I can see a pattern building very similar to other mainstream Christian media.
15 hours ago
 Also, sorry I didn‚Äôt answer you last night. I have a con I‚Äôm going to this weekend and was furiously painting things for it haha
15 hours ago
 Back to what I was saying... part of the reason I‚Äôm skeptical of many mainstream Christian books/movies these days is because they seem to be crafted only to make those that agree with the creators feel good about themselves. Very rarely is it ACTUALLY about engaging in meaningful conversation with those who disagree with us or thoroughly studying portions of the Bible and supporting it with research. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve heard of the movie God‚Äôs Not Dead, but it‚Äôs full of poor reasoning that paints atheists as angry children that are mad at God for a specific reason and if they‚Äôd ‚ÄúJust get over it, they‚Äôd believe.‚Äù
15 hours ago
 Oh, too long. Sorry. &gt;_&gt;

 The terrible part is, I was fed this mainstream Christian garbage so much that I still gloss over it if I‚Äôm not careful. I‚Äôm truthfully not good at spotting poor arguments and just sort of sit and listen. It takes a lot of thought for me because my brain has been so wired to believe it... it‚Äôs frustrating.
15 hours ago
 There are several patterns in the analysis. You are very right about the worry. I know that feeling well.
13 hours ago
 Only in the past couple years have I been able to admit to myself that I've essentially escaped a cult.

 If you are interested in digging into legitimate Christian scholarship (even for lay people), my wife would be a good source. Comparative religion would be something you'd be interested in, imho. You have a knack for it from what I can tell in your reasoning about DnD.

 I didn't watch that movie, but I've read a bit about it. I saw some clips. I don't have the stomach for it. I wade into that only to help someone else at this point.

 Don't worry about long posts messages btw. I'm reading off my compter screen. That message block is 4x8 inches across my screen; it's a comfortable blurb.

 (I'm also not one who attends to the conventions of writing direct messaging unless I can find strong justification)

 I do understand your frustration. It's really hard work. It's worth your time though.
12 hours ago
 I've found it fun in some contexts and painful in others. I keep coming back to try though because I'm convinced it's at the core of being human.
12 hours ago
 I would be very interested in what [[k0sh3k]] has to say. I‚Äôve made a few weak attempts at finding decent studying material, but haven‚Äôt had a ton of luck because I just don‚Äôt even know where to look.
12 hours ago
 I have one book I‚Äôve been reading on and off, but I haven‚Äôt made a consistent effort to read through it. I need to build the habit of studying and learning for fun.... and I really suck at it.
12 hours ago
 Okay, back to reading. I‚Äôm still not done yet. XD
11 hours ago
 [[k0sh3k]] also reviewed the first chapter separately from me. We'll be sending both of our responses.
11 hours ago
 You should ask her for reading materials.
11 hours ago
 As usual, I would recommend the wiki for researching. You know me though: broken record.
11 hours ago
 I should. Maybe she can help me start off ‚Äúeasy‚Äù so I can work on building the habit.
11 hours ago
 I‚Äôve actually seriously considered that.
11 hours ago
 I really like to document and take notes ‚Äî it helps me remember and think things through more
11 hours ago
 That's why I like the wiki. It makes mapping out new territory in a systematic way easy and very effective. Organization in the survey and figuring out where to dig deeper (or connect dots differently through different dimensions of a problem set) is the hard part.
11 hours ago
 yes
11 hours ago
 If you aren't practicing and digesting the information, it doesn't actually get built into your limbic system
11 hours ago
 And I think the wiki may be my ultimate answer to that. I feel as though it gives me the freedom of randomness but the utility of structure.
11 hours ago
 Right.
11 hours ago
 if and when you decide to setup TW, please let me know. I want to give you some guidance on what I feel are very useful things to setup. It might take an hour to get the technical stuff setup, but it's worth it in the end. You'll want versioning/backups and redundancy (it has saved every person's butt in the family several times).

 Good to know. o7</code></pre></div>
