<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My children called their granddonors back after my wife and I repeatedly asked them to do so (we've also asked them to write thank you letters for the winter hat gifts).</p><p>Afterward, my daughter said they asked an odd question.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You can give us three answers to this question: &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;we're not allowed to talk about it.&quot; ‚Äì Can you install Skype?
</p></blockquote><p>Wow. Somehow, I am still surprised by it even when I predict this route. Unless I'm mistaken, it appears they keep digging themselves deeper into this hole. I think they aim to paint a false picture for my children in which I've prevented my donors from contacting my children. That is clearly false, and my children know it. When <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="MWF.html">MWF</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SLT.html">SLT</a> attempt to implant this false doubt and my children see the tactic for what it is, their gaslighting plan backfires. </p><p>It is true: there are limitations on contact in person, though we have worked to enable that as well. I actively encourage e-mails, SMS, phone calls, video chat, instant messaging, etc. It's true that Skype is not software I respect, but I use plenty of software I don't respect (even though I try to use alternatives).</p><p>I don't think a relationship with these narcissists is good for my children, but as I've stated before, my best option here is to not prevent the relationship. I keep my hands clean. I am still convinced that my donors won't put in the time, and that lack of effort in communication will do all the talking in the end. I continue to encourage my children to maintain the tie because, as I've said, I think that's exactly what will expose <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="MWF.html">MWF</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SLT.html">SLT</a> for who they are to my children. Contacting my children once every couple months is not actually trying to maintain a relationship. I think they want to find a way to blame their choice not to be in my children's lives on me. I've made that tactic quite clear. Again, I am grateful to have my wiki as an open record of this.</p><p>My daughter told them the truth: they recently had limited access to their devices because they aren't doing well enough in their schoolwork, but they can install Skype.
