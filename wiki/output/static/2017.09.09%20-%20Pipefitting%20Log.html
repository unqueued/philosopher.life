<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>We took extra time to get through a different gate. We also have new Yates badges, signing in and carding.</p><p>Dave didn't lead the morning meeting. A new pipe foreman did. </p><p>I asked if we were going to finish the fitup from yesterday. I was told no by Chris-M. I got our gear for the trunion. Immediately told we were switching to fitup, lol.</p><p>I got my harness, untangled some drop cords and waited. Still no oxy torch for the cut we were waiting on. They did it by Metabo. </p><p>Eventually, I was asked to put a ratchet strap on so we could twist the pipe. I am not convinced this will work. I think moving the elbow at the top is the best option. Rope, yo!</p><p>I talked to Greg a lot this morning. He has a unique perspective on the field. He recommends HVAC or electrician if I can't get on at Eastman on BAE through Thompson. He has also regretted traveling. He says the quick buck wasn't worth it.</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>We fitup the pipe. I just helped position. It took a lot of hands several hours.</p><p>I asked Dave for a list of his tools. I probably have everything he recommends, but better safe than sorry.</p><h2 class="">Lunch!</h2><p>Tina, Chester's wife, brought pizza for us coming in on Saturday. That reminds me of the glad-handing &quot;We appreciate you&quot; bullshit. This is manipulation.</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>We took down some rigging off the pipe we fitup. We took down a giant tarp (I have no idea why it was there in the first place). My wire cutters were quite useful. </p><p>I talked at length with the new pipewelder/fitter Oliver. He was homeschooled, as are his kids. The usual conservative story. He is fairly intelligent in some respects, although clearly uneducated. We talked about a great many things.</p><p>I took our gear back to the tool room.</p><p>I struggled to find anything to do. Chris-M helped me out by having me take measurements of pipes and label them against the isos. I didn't get far before Dave asked me to clean.</p><p>We are cleaning early today.  We are preparing for the hurricane/tropical storm coming our way. Additionally, we have to make room for an exceptionally large train coming through on Monday.</p></div>
