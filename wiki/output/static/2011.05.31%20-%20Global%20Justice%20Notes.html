<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Jan 19</p><p>Hobbes - Any state is better than none. State of nature blows.
Locke - Didn't think State of nature was as bad as Hobbes made it out be. Property rights and retributive justice concerns dominated his line of thought. </p><p>Contractors
State of nature</p><p>Any social contract theory will be such - Imagine what contractors within the state of nature would agree to. Whatever the output, these will be the principles of justice. </p><p>Rawls doesn't talk about the state of nature, he talks about the &quot;original position.&quot; It doesn't offer a description of what 'real life' is supposed to be like, this is an extreme abstraction. It structures intuitions we have about justice and how we can formulate them.</p><p>Rawls' contractors are &quot;rationally disinterested utility maximizers&quot; (egoism) and &quot;have a sense of justice&quot; (begging the question, lulz?). They aren't beneficient or malevolent towards other people, they are indifferent. They seek &quot;justice&quot; (particularly fairness).</p><p>The important part of the &quot;original position&quot; maintains the &quot;veil of ignorance.&quot; Differences that are arbitrary from the moral point of view shouldn't count with regards to how the principles of justice treat you. Arbitrary features include more than just gender, etc., but also (controversially) things such as religion, etc. If you couldn't know who you were, what would you choose? They would come up with two principles (acc. to Rawls).</p><p>1. Principle of Greatest Equal Liberty - People are to be as free as possible.
2. Difference Principle - Social and economic advantages should be distributed to maximize the shares of the most disadvantaged, those on the bottom line. Maximize the minimum (maxi-min).</p><p>Imho, maxi-min isn't necessarily correct in game theory. perhaps the highest average utils will come from something different (although still likely based upon similar thoughts). I'm not convinced that the difference principle necessary results in the &quot;free market, cradle-to-grave social system&quot; state either.</p><p>Rawls thinks that Principle 1 is more important than principle 2.</p><p>Imho, again not simple, Perhaps the trade in priority results in whether or not you can feed yourself in the end (I don't know.).</p><p>Reflective Equilibirium - you constantly go back and forth between the RL and the OPosition to make sure that you have it correct. Rawls happens to think he got it right with his principles, but in case he was wrong (and we were wrong), then this method allows us to correct it.</p><p>Sandel argues that Rawls has terrible picture of human nature (similar to Kant's). Rawls doesn't make these assumptions, he is just offering a heuristic device.</p><p>Jan 24</p><p>The Theory applies to the Basic Structure of a society. Domestic, and formal, legal, political institutions. Includes economic institutions (nat. banks, treasuries), informal banking regulations, etc. Social institutions, such as families. The institutions which comprise a basic structure have profound effects upon those born under them. As a result, the Theory is a theory about domestic justice.</p><p>Free market, competitive advantage, etc. generate innovation, and maximize utility for the bottom line as well.</p><p>National boundaries seem arbitrary. Historical accidents.</p><p>There is no principle of distributive justice, globally. &quot;Duty of assistance&quot; (which is somewhat unspecified) is maybe justice or moral based. Well-ordered societies must assist &quot;burdened&quot; countries (those who can't get their act together, have disorder) until those countries also become well-ordered. Differences of wealth between the countries are somehow irrelevant. Only if you &quot;know&quot; this assistance will help the country become well-ordered, only then do you need to help them.</p><p>'Well-ordered' means what?</p><p>Rawls thinks the sources of poverty have a national/local origin.</p><p>What if poverty isn't of local origin? Take an agricultural nation which relies upon agriculture to be out of poverty. Another nation might artifically flood agricultural markets with super cheap products, eliminating the ability to agricultural nation to viably pull themselves out of poverty. </p><p>It fails to understand globalization principles and how interdependent nations are upon other nations. Some vital factors of economic viability of a nation aren't necessarily in the hands of those nation. </p><p>There is a problem with &quot;stability&quot; in the Theory, and that is that Political Liberalism is, in part, correcting.</p><p>Utility, in practice, seems an unstable theory of justice, in Rawls' opinion. You can't expect people to be better than they are...they won't, for example, sacrifice for their own well being to maximize overall utility.</p><p>Ideal Moral Theory - But, not in the sense that it is detached from Human beings as they are...</p><p>Comprehensive Moral Theory or Moral Doctrine - A theory which comprehensively (in scope) which regulates everything. No distinction between morality and justice, for example. </p><p>Moral theories have political content, even about how political institutions should be understood. </p><p>Political Theory only deals with political institutions, but not the &quot;good&quot; or any comprehensive account of morality.</p><p>Metric of political liberalism isn't &quot;it is true&quot; but rather &quot;it is reasonable&quot; - What is reasonable (as he uses it as a technical term)? For now, being reasonable amounts to &quot;being willing to put forth and abide by principles of cooperation&quot; and &quot;recognizes the burdens of judgment.&quot; This recognition is realizing that reasonable persons can disagree with each other, just because figuring out certain facts can be really complicated (or next to impossible). </p><p>We won't find the 'comprehensive theory' to rule them all. </p><p>Celebrate relativism! yay.</p><p>What is a political institution? For cereal. I think so many things count as this.</p><p>There is overlap among the various comprehensive doctrines. What they agree on is &quot;justice as fairness&quot; .. thus JoF is a free standing module because it doesn't rely upon any comprehensive doctrine. They all accept it though. </p><p>Abandons pretense or aspirations towards truth. He has given into the pramatic postmodernists.</p><p>Jan 31</p><p>Normativity of Rawls' political theory is limited in scope. Articulates principles directed at political institutions and political structures. It attempts to avoid controversial elements, and thus is amenable to a whole variety of comprehensive theories.</p><p>Political liberalism is a free-standing module that you can plug into any old 'reasonable' comprehensive theory. Kant, Mill, etc. should all (supposedly) be able to insert or make use of this module without internal contradiction.</p><p>Right is prior to the good - Principles of justice are prior to deep philosophical accounts of morality and 'the good'. </p><p>Given pluralism, he thinks we must seek justice principles which maximize stability. Rawls' doesn't describe the account of justice as &quot;true&quot; - the reason behind this is because to talk about truth is to talk about something which is quite controversial. &quot;Being reasonable&quot; isn't necessarily about truth. This seems somewhat post-modern. </p><p>Legitimacy has an important role in Rawls' theory. Justice and legitimacy are independent concepts. Justice is a question of &quot;how should political institutions be organized and what does the state owe its citizens?&quot;. Legitimacy of the state is a different sort of questions, although it may be related in some ways. Questions of legitimacy is about whether or not the state as a coercive force has the right to force people to obey its laws. </p><p>Political liberalism is an account of legitimacy. The state &quot;exercisizes totalizing coercive control over the people, and claims to have that power&quot; etc.</p><p>Liberal principle of legitimacy - The exercise of coercive power is only acceptable if it is done in terms that the people are willing to accept. If political institutions are acceptable to people, then it is legitimate. If you can reasonably find it unacceptable, then it is not legitimate. This is different from Lockean 'consent' in that consent is a formal social contract, but otherwise quite similar. The &quot;that seems about right&quot; aspect of his theory is his form of consent, but is exactly the sort of informal sort of reasoning that makes it not count as full-blown 'consent', which is far more exacting in its attribution of what institutions are acceptable. There is a difference between actual affirmation and 'couldn't reasonably reject'. This justifies coercive state power, and solves the problem of stability. 'Couldn't be rejected' etc. seems to engender some sort of stability. He does mean more than stability, he even means stability for the right reasons. It isn't just a practical worry, but also a normative worry.</p><hr><p>The Laws of People, intro.</p><p>The Theory is similar to Anselm's onto argument because it seems to use mundane and simple premises, and arrives at a seemingly grand conclusion. It was meant not to be controversial, but somehow it is the exact sort of thing which is so very controversial.</p><p>A foreign policy of a reasonably just liberal people (state). Rawls' lays out what these people think. This is a justification offered from a reasonably just liberal people. It is not an account of full-blown international justice. How should liberal peoples treat other peoples of a variety of different views?</p><p>The theory is supposed to describe 'realistic utopia'. It gets at methodological theories about what political theories are supposed to be trying to do. He imports this from Rousseau. &quot;Taking men as they are and laws as they might be.&quot; Any theory of justice that only gets off the ground by imaging people to be saints, angels, or unrealistically altruistic, or whatever, then that theory fails. Theories which are not realistic and rooted in real constraints are bad theories, he thinks. They still need to be ideal, as they are about looking forward. </p><p>Theories of justice are relative to the peoples that are used to describe them. This isn't a long term nor universal view. It is a medium term. What that exactly means, we aren't sure. </p><p>Structure of theory, there are multiple 'Original Position' argument styles here. There is an OP for us as a domestic peoples, but also a different OP for us as 'liberal peoples' towards everyone.</p><p>'Decent peoples' or 'Decent hierarchal peoples' - They aren't aggressive (invading others), common good conception of justice, honor laws of peace,...pg 67.</p><p>Law of peoples (not of states, nor persons) because ...</p><p>Sections 15 and 16 must be read by next week.</p><p>Feb 2</p><p>1 Domestic OP
2 International OPs - Reasonably, liberal peoples - the 3rd is 'decent peoples'</p><p>Peoples = National groups
Person is a person. Peoples (pg 23) have 3 features, 1) united by particular kind of gov, 2) common sympathies, 3) firm attachment to poli-moral conception of right and justice.</p><p>IOP consists of persons (representatives from the world all over) wouuld be different from IOP consisting of peoples. </p><p>&quot;States&quot; talk is too rational-animal - incapable of sympathy for other nations. </p><hr><p>Beitz thinks that laws that exist now are more progressive that Rawls' ideal laws (which is thus deemed, not good enough).</p><hr><p>Temporal issue, generation might choose one, and later generations pay...is that later generation really responsible for it?</p><p>-‚ÄîDomestic basic structures are stronger than international basic structures in terms of the justice requirements and the coercive powers which predate the peoples which are overseen.</p><p>Feb 7</p><p>Sovereignty, and the enforcement it brings, is what activates justice. Justice is practical, not ideal, in this sense.</p><p>Justice &amp; Sovereignty
He has two different views. </p><p>Cosmopolitan (monist)
Justice isn't activated by special conditions. Sovereignty isn't necessarily, in this sense.</p><p>Political (plurality, or dualist)
Social institutions, States aren't merely instrumental, they are what gives Justice its value.</p><p>Justice is a special class of moral obligations. It only occurs in certain sorts of circumstances. And different sorts of circumstances call will generate different sorts of Justice.</p><p>Justice is 'associate' in this view. The demands of justice only arrive out of particular kinds of associations. 
Associatons, for Rawls', are setup by the basic structure.The primary social and economic situations that characterize political life. What turns on the 'switch' of justice, from these basic structures? </p><p>2 Conditions for basic structures turning on the lights.</p><p>Liability of coercive institutions
The state represents its people - It claims to speak on behalf of the participants of the country (in some sense).</p><p>In acting in my name, it involves my agency/will in a particular way, and puts me on the hook for its actions, whether I formally consent or not. It forces responsibility for its action on us.</p><p>We get to ask about this justification, and the answer to what justifies it will be the Rawlsian notions of the original position - the difference principle giving us a good answer. </p><p>Virtue is a mean/balance between two vices: excess and deficiency</p><p>If the state doesn't claim to act in the name of its citizens, and thus making them responsible for its actions, then it looks like the demands of justice (justification) don't arise. </p><p>Feb 9</p><p>Nagel - Coercion + Representation = Justificatory Demand ‚Äì&gt; (via standard contractarian story) Obligations of distributive justice. If coercion alone activates justice, then it seems as though justice is global immediately from immigration and trade concerns, etc. There is international coercion, and thus he wants to say there must be more required to start justice. </p><p>Blake - Blake does not have this Representation requirement </p><p>Autonomy worries about coercion</p><p>Criminal Law (jail) and Civil (suing fo' teh monies) is very coercive. Civil code defines/constrains our property, a central justification piece to our distributive justice system.</p><p>There is no global government that can 'arrest you'. There aren't formal/legal institutions. </p><p>You don't volunteer to be under a coercive institution, then that institution is where justice starts.</p><p>This class is a joke.</p><p>States enforce and protect our autonomy. </p><p>Feb 14</p><p>Positive Right - A freedom 'to' something. Health care, for example.
Negative Right - A freedom not to be hindered. Free speech.</p><p>Positive Duty - A duty To &quot; &quot; &quot; - morally obliged to do somethin
Negative Duty - A duty not to engage in particular actions</p><p>Pogge thinks Justice is a set of positive obligation (Positive Duties).</p><p>They are interested in using the least controversial premises.</p><p>3? Sources of Harm that Rich countries do to Poor countries:
1) unfair trade (substantial cause) - e.g. Agricultural subsidies
2) internal legal system which recognizes de facto authorities in power
3) sale of natural resources
4) lending priviledges (de facto authority takes the money and runs, leaving the country with debt)</p><p>Riss:</p><p>Geographic Growth Theory is based on geograhical factors, quality of human resources, and transport costs. Local factors. Think geographic determism of &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;. </p><p>Integration Growth Theory is about globalalization, and international market integration. Global explanation, unlike the other two theories.</p><p>Institutional Growth Theory is about laws, rights, and civic institutions. Local explanation, again.</p><p>He thinks the institutional theory/view is most promising. In part because he thinks that the other two theories a funneled into it. Institutions are the foundation in his view.</p><p>Even if he is right about the empiricism, is he right that it dictates his theoretical, normative view? If you hold Rawls' perspective, sure. </p><p>If you don't take his position, it seems reasonable that if we had a 'decently plausible' way of installing government and institutions, and if it seemed the best option, that developed nations should impose such a thing on developing nations.</p><p>Feb 16</p><p>Coercion accounts. Blake and Nagel - </p><p>Only a nation-state coerces in this way, and thus we have distributive justice at this level. Not at international.</p><p>Blake - Formal legal coercion. Blake is about property.</p><p>Riss:</p><p>What makes international coercion different (of the wrong kind to activate global justice) from nation-state coercion.</p><p>678, Blake discussion - perfect abstract of Blake</p><p>1) International organizations don't really coerce.
2) Domestic states are required for autonomy.
3) Only domestic states coerce immediately.
4) Only states coerce on property.
5) international coercion exists, but is different in kind (and weaker, essentially), not activating justice.</p><p>Riss - immediacy of state coercion - Geographical logcations don't matter.</p><p>That immediacy has two dimensions: 1) legal and 2) political</p><p>Legal‚Äì
1) Directness (physical/geographical control over you and your property)
2) Pervasiveness</p><p>Political‚Äì
1) Profundity </p><p>Necessary for the realization for basic moral rights</p><p>690 stronger answer
691 weaker answer</p><p>Riss thinks that directness, pervasiveness, profundity types of coercion from domestic nations spill out to the international scene, but only in a weaker sense than we see in the nation-state.</p><p>Feb 21</p><p>Caney - Cosmopolitan, expansive theories of justice. There aren't any separate theories of global justice from domestic justice. The sorts of arguments which are valid for domestic work exactly the same for global justice. </p><p>He gives you 5 arguments for it, however - any of them are sufficient.</p><p>-Contractarian
-Consequentialist
-Right's based</p><p>Cosmopolitanism is defined by 3 kinds of considerations:</p><p>1) Individualism - the idea that human individuals are the ultimate source of moral value and moral concern. Individuals rather than states. Cooperatives might or might not have value, but they only matter in virtue of the individuals which comprise them.</p><p>2) Universality - moral value or concerns attach themselves to all peoples everywhere. They have a universal scope. All humans, equally, are subject to this moral concern.</p><p>3) Generality - There are no 'special moral concerns'. Like, moral obligations among a class of peoples or something.</p><p>Sometimes used to define people who simply have a robust account of distributive justice. </p><p>Note that cosmopolitanism doesn't necessary commit you to any institutions (like a global gov. or something). </p><p>Caney isn't offering a systematic account of global justice, but rather that global distributive justice is of a seamless piece of a web of justice, such that if there X for domestic justice then there is also X for global justice. </p><p>Two types of contractarian theories - </p><p>1) Institutional
2) (doesn't really give it a name, but we say for class:) Universal Interests</p><p>Of 1), there are 2 types</p><p>1a) Beitz
1b) Pogge</p><p>Of 1a), there are two arguments:</p><p>1a1) Natural resources (not very institutional)
1a2) Global basic structure argument</p><p>1a1 - Nat. resources seem to be arbitrary, and thus it seems nobody can have a true claim to them. There should be a 'global resource tax'. Anytime that you took/used/exploited a natural resource, you have to pay for it, so that resource poor nations aren't at a loss. It equalizes the value of natural resources across the world.</p><p>1a1 is instutitonal because it still sees justice as attaching itself to institutional relationships. in this case, it arrises out of global basic structures. And, he thinks those global basic structures already exist. </p><p>1a2 - What is is about basic structures that matter? It isn't that they are mutally advantageous. instead, it just had to do with the productive of benefits and burdens.</p><p>Caney worries (111) (against any kind of institutionalism) - distributive justice concerns entitlements, but global basic structures just don't seem to be related in any way to these entitlements. </p><p>'Arbitrary differences' are used differently for Caney and Rawls. Caney thinks arbitrary is quite universal a concern for justice. Arbitrary only matters in more limited circumstances for Rawls. If there are arbitrary differences in natural resources, then why not make the same argument for arbitrary differences in IQ. Should we tax people for high IQs?
 
1b) Also institutional, but in a funny kind of a way. Pogge is interested in negative duties not to harm (don't harm). That is an institutional kind of duty, in his view, because one can only have this duty as a member of an institutional. Because you are a member of an institution that you are on the hook, so to speak. </p><p>Caney's point is that this is fine, but just vecause one has a negative duty not to harm does not entail that this is the limit of our duties. Perhaps we have other duties in addition, which is demanded by distributive justice.</p><p>Caney is against institutionalism because it violates his cosmopolitanism</p><p>2) Moral persons should have a global difference principle. Beitzian contractarian, &quot;so long as you are a person, you should count in the original position&quot;.</p><p>Feb 23</p><p>Caney - Utility/Consequentialist</p><p>Principle of Rescue - If you can prevent something bad without sacrificing something of similar moral value, then you should do it.</p><p>Rights-based approaches - rooted in the idea of human rights. There are central human goods are are so important, they ought to be codified as rights. It seems that this can lead to cosmopolitanism very easily. </p><p>Subsistence seems to be an especially basic and especially foundational right as it is a the precondition to enjoying all the other sorts of rights. Substistence is a super-right.</p><p>Hohfeld - Liberty right (free to pursue) vs. Claim right (duties towards). Liberty right to substistence is weaker than the claim right.</p><hr><p>Brock - Cosmopolitan</p><p>Essentially agrees to Rawlsian method, but disagrees with the &quot;Difference principle&quot; output. She has a more conservative output, namely social minimum. </p><p>International institutions can, in some ways, undermine domestic and local institutions.</p><p>Pogge issues: negative duties not to harm
Resource Privilege - Any gov's right to sell resources on the open market (harms people, cause it can steal nat. resources)
Borrowing Privilege - Leaders can put country into debt, and they can steal it, and leave the country screwed
Unfair Trade - Subsidies that bury poor nations comparative advantage</p><p>Pogge - GLobal resource dividend is the retribution for these harmful effects</p><p>Pogge's theoretical claim not to harm is not controversial, but his empirical claims 'that we are harming other nations' are controversial.</p><p>Feb 28</p><p>Pogge-</p><p>We cause the poverty. It is, in some way, our fault that others are poor. We shouldn't harm people, and if we do, then we owe them redistribution. </p><p>Moral universalism‚Äì</p><p>1) all people are subject to morality
2) moral benefits and burdens are then distributed to all
3) moral benfeits and burdens are formulated generally so as not to privilege or disadvantage any person for an arbitrary reason</p><p>He defends a strong thesis:</p><p>There is extreme poverty that coudl be fixed with minimal sacrifices by developed countries. So, 2 claims being made:
1) Extreme poverty can be fixed
2) Fixing requires minimal sacrifices</p><p>Mar 2</p><p>1) It isn't realistic to expect Pogge's specific GRD proposal to be enacted in the future (but then, how far into the future? etc.)
2) Poverty relief can only realistically be achieved with massive local political reform</p><p>Risse - responding to Pogge, claims that Pogge is wrong about global harm issue. Risse thinks globalization has only been good. What is the baseline of harm, also?</p><p>Mar 14</p><p>Pogge combines theoretical elements with emprical data to make a robust retributive justice system. The empirical component of his argument does a lot of work for him. He really needs to it demonstrate that &quot;The developed world causes the poverty in the developing world.&quot; From this 'fact', he is able to use his theoretical component to make a powerful argument for what we should do.</p><p>Cohen - His belief of what counts as Pogge's thesis - Strong Thesis -  Most of the global poverty problem could be eliminated through minor modifications in the global order that would entail at most slight reductions in the incomes of the affluent</p><p>or, we have can these forms of the thesis:</p><p>1) Most poverty is caused by develoepd nations.
2) This poverty could be eliminated with minimal sacrifice by the developed nations.</p><p>vs.</p><p>Purely Domestic Poverty Thesis (PDPT) - Purely Domestic Poverty Thesis: ‚ÄúThe persistence of severe poverty is
due solely to domestic causes</p><p>vs.</p><p>Conventional Thesis - Conventional Thesis: Some global poverty could be eliminated by changes in global rules that would not themselves result in serious moral injuries.</p><p>The strong thesis demonstrate more certainty about what sorts of claims (particular the 'most poverty' responsibility claims) that can derived from the empirical data than the conventional thesis.</p><p>In the 'independent effects' picture, poverty is overdetermined by factors. There are multiple causes of poverty and therefore multiple solutions to poverty.</p><p>Global institutions causing poverty in a nation and Domestic inst causing poverty in that nation
like:</p><p>Global inst-&gt; poverty
Domestic inst-&gt;</p><p>Endogenous effects picture is:</p><p>Global inst -&gt; Domestic inst -&gt; poverty</p><p>Cohen isn't saying that Pogge is wrong about the Strong thesis, but he is saying that Pogge is wrong about how effective the empircal data can support the strong thesis. The claim is that the empirical evidence is less certain and more controversial than Pogge seems to think.</p><p>Mar 16</p><p>Pogge respondes to Cohen, explaining that Cohen fails to look at the statistics which advanced/motivated his (Pogge's) argument. </p><p>Mar 21</p><p>Pogge is claiming that the empirical evidence required to support or deny his argument is, in some sense, sparse. We need more evidence. But, given our current evidence, it is good enough to support his theory. </p><p>Poverty Shortfall for $1.25/day(ppp) - only 76 BIllion dollars required to fix this (1.4 billion are below this). </p><p>76 Billion is .17% of global GDP</p><p>&quot; So a denial of the Strong Thesis
comes to this: there is no way that global institutional design decisions
during 1980‚Äì2005 could ‚Äì without substantial reductions in the incomes
of the affluent ‚Äì have been made in a more poverty-avoiding way so
as to effect, over this entire 25-year period, a 0.14% (1/700) cumulative
difference to the global distribution of household income in favor of

---‚Äî</p><p>April 11</p><p>Wellman - Defends a really strong conclusion, he defends a right, though he doesn't defend a view about how that right is best exercised. He thinks states are in their rights to refuse people seeking political asylum. That is strong. A state, by its rights, coudl seal the borders, but that might not be a good exercise of it. There might be other moral considerations which lead us to exercise the right in a very limited way, having a porous border instead perhaps.</p><p>Deonotological rights can have narrow constraints</p><p>Racist groups have a right/freedom of association. Just because we say they have this right doesn't mean we are endorsing their view.</p><p>States are associations - they have freedom of association.</p><p>It might be true that rich countries have a distributive obligation to help poor countries, but that doesn't negate their control of the borders. They can't violate your borders just because you fail to meet your financial duty to help them. The association of the state is so strong that it overcomes many other things.</p><p>Samaritanism</p><p>April 13</p><p>Wellman - progressive, real world leanings
The world is a better place if we open our borders. But, in his article, he defends the claim that states have a right to decline immigrants passing their borders. States are an association of a particular kind. Part of the right of association is the right not to associate with certain people, thus they can choose not to associate with others. </p><p>To me, why can't a person cross a geographical boundry without crossing into the association? A stronger link between the geography as a defining characteristic of the association must be drawn.</p><p>It would work in theory, but in practice, it seems that those rights are qualified by other moral concerns of justice, which in practice, will not demonstrate an actual regulation of borders.</p><p>It is easy to see this argument flowing:
Liberal foundations ‚Äì&gt; Open borders</p><p>Liberal Foundations might be at odds with democratic theory</p><p>This seems odd, because the very thing that might motivate someone towards democracy is a liberal foundation. </p><p>But, note, democracy doesn't guarantee a concern for liberties. The democracy might be against it. Take a middle eastern nation, possibly, might actually be against it. They might vote for genocide or whatever.</p><p>There is a story about howto justify a particular government's political/coercive power.</p><p>But, that sort of argument doesn't necessarily lead to open borders, but rather, perhaps to closed borders.</p><p>Democratic Theory ‚Äì&gt; Closed Borders</p><p>human rights are ulti-
mately viewed as constraints upon, and in tension with, the right of a demo-
cratic people unilaterally to control its own boundaries</p><p>self-determination, we the people are about this, and that entails control over one's borders</p><p>The tension between democratic theory and liberalism is very real, and a prime example is the open/closed borders.</p><p>Abizadeh believes this is false. He claims that democratic theory actually leads to open borders.</p><p>My thesis is that,
according to democratic theory, the democratic justification for a regime of
border control is ultimately owed to both members and nonmembers</p><p>First, a democratic theory of popular sovereignty requires
that the coercive exercise of political power be democratically justified to
all those over whom it is exercised, that is, justification is owed to all those
subject to state coercion. Second, the regime of border control of a bounded
political community subjects both members and nonmembers to the state‚Äôs
coercive exercise of power. Therefore, the justification for a particular
regime of border control is owed not just to those whom the boundary
marks as members, but to nonmembers as well</p><p>non-members when crossing borders seem to obviously be subject to the coercive powers of the state</p><p>'demos thesis'</p><p>The unbounded demos thesis does not merely support the argument for
why democratic theory intrinsically requires that regimes of border control
be jointly determined by citizens and foreigners (unless democratically del-
egated to citizens). It also shows why the most important intrinsic democ-
ratic argument‚Äîthe self-determination argument‚Äîfor a polity‚Äôs unilateral
right to determine its own regime of border control fails.</p><p>pg 49, 1st full paragraph.</p><p>May 2</p><p>Coercion &amp; claims state acting in the name of the people...forgot who says this.

He thinks democratic theory and liberal concern come apart (for alot of reasons). Democratic theory is aimed at justifying the coercive power of the state, esp. because everyone seems equal and partaking in self-determination. This seems to come apart from issues about open borders, in fact, perahps it is a justifcation for closed borders.</p></div>
