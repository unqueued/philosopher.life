 There‚Äôs this obscure thing that happens when you go to a can where your brain just kinda shuts off and you mistreat your body because the hype is too strong.

3 hours ago
 I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve met canonically
3 hours ago
 Fair point
3 hours ago

3 hours ago
 When we see Team Rocket we boo them, start telling them to get off our turf, and then start chanting ‚ÄúTeam Skull‚Äù xD

 there must be many unspoken social rules at these cons
2 hours ago
 what did you do?
2 hours ago
 Yes! Lots of people here are big introverts so it can get really overwhelming.
2 hours ago
 What do you mean?
2 hours ago
 err...I mean, what activities did you engage in throughout the day?
2 hours ago
 did you walk around and talk to others, did you listen to any speakers, did you see a show?
2 hours ago
 I'm sure the cons are all different in this regard
2 hours ago
 It sounds like you went with a group of people you know (from the video).
2 hours ago
 Lots of walking around, taking pictures, meeting with people we know, buying nerdy thing
2 hours ago
 We sometimes go to panels of voice actors we know of or that sound fun
2 hours ago
 And also sometimes stand in line for signatures of voice actors we know
2 hours ago
 But the last two are more rare. Standing in line isn‚Äôt very fun.
