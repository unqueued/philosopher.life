9 HR AGO
&lt;3
9 HR AGO
That's me!
9 HR AGO
Woot I found you! :blush:
9 HR AGO
I'm in the middle of drafting your letter. I assume that's how you got on Signal.
9 HR AGO
How have you been?
9 HR AGO
Yes I saw ‚Äîdoing well ( on the up side of strep) How are you?
9 HR AGO
Strep is spreading like wildfire here too.
9 HR AGO
We've been lucky enough not to catch it yet.
9 HR AGO
I'm doing well enough. Read+Writing a lot.
9 HR AGO
I have restrained myself from breathing on my more difficult students
9 HR AGO
rofl
9 HR AGO
My brother [[AIR]] just came to visit. I haven't seen him since Summer, so that was awesome.
9 HR AGO
Is anyone else in your family also sick?
9 HR AGO
I would love to see him. I am so glad he got down to see you
9 HR AGO
[[AG]] is over it and we are working on giving it to [[UJ]]
9 HR AGO
hehe
9 HR AGO
May have to lick his toothbrush :face_with_rolling_eyes:
9 HR AGO
Jk
9 HR AGO
Or go for his bagpipes.
9 HR AGO
What instruments has he been playing recently? And, what has he been playing?
9 HR AGO
Mostly guitar and tuba
9 HR AGO
We've been playing guitar and banjo recently. It's been fun to jam as a family.
9 HR AGO
Also, [[AIR]] works so much it's hard to see him for more than a few hours usually. He cannot make it for Thanksgiving because he's chef'ing it up. I have already planned to visit my mother-in-law for the holiday.
9 HR AGO
But, I'm trying ot see if there's a way to make it to your Thanksgiving. It may just be me that can attend.
9 HR AGO
What classes have you been teaching this semester?
9 HR AGO
Yeah food service is not a forgiving profession‚Äîwill miss him! I am hoping he can make another time to see me
9 HR AGO
We would love to have you. Bring your guitar or banjo, [[UJ]] would love to jam with you. It‚Äôs his language
9 HR AGO
[[AG]] loves your kids so we need to make time for them to get together
9 HR AGO
Yes.
9 HR AGO
Maybe we could go camping or something.
9 HR AGO
Mostly math (which I love even more than science‚Äîwho‚Äôd have thought) and a physics which is math
9 HR AGO
Oooo that would be good
9 HR AGO
I regret not learning more math. If I could go back and fix it, I would.
9 HR AGO
I am currently interested in linear logic and quaternions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion).
9 HR AGO
I think there is something very special there.
9 HR AGO
I agree ‚Äîand it takes a special mind to follow that
9 HR AGO
It is fairly cold already. I think the Spring would be the best time to camp.
9 HR AGO
I am the basics teacher (Alg 1, Geo and Alg 2) ‚Äîmy biggest challenge is getting kids out of the ‚ÄúI am not good at math, so I am not going to try‚Äù mentality
9 HR AGO
Indeed, mathphobia is real.
9 HR AGO
Indeed
9 HR AGO
I keep trying to find ways to make it come alive for the kids. We made a lot of progress last year by spending 2 months doing nothing but math everyday.
9 HR AGO
We have this book series I had never heard of before called &quot;Life of Fred&quot;
9 HR AGO
Btw google for educators gives me unlimited storage on my google drive so that‚Äôs where I store all my stuff. I figured I could share with you. Is there a better way to move large digital files?
9 HR AGO
It's like a narrative telling of mathematics
9 HR AGO
I have heard of that but haven‚Äôt looked at it ‚ÄîI shall have to do that
9 HR AGO
Unlimited storage is really hard to beat!
9 HR AGO
I am huge fan of Resilio Sync (https://www.resilio.com/individuals/), since it allows me to own my cloud.
9 HR AGO
Either is fine with me.
9 HR AGO
Yeah ‚ÄîI have close to 70 gigs right now
9 HR AGO
That is a huge arsenal, lol.
9 HR AGO
The school was complaining that I was using up too much of the server ‚ÄîI am glad they changed
9 HR AGO
Resilio Sync is basically a mutable torrent client. You sync a directory, and there are 3 ways to join the swarm. Read+Write key, Read-only key, and Encrypted-version key. It allows me to connect my data to all my devices, and I even store an encrypted copy of my data on server's I don't own. It's very fast. If I add 70gb to a directory, the whole swarm that has that key starts sharing it. But, you have to pay for the storage space/devices.
8 HR AGO
Does your school use gmail as their mail system as well?
8 HR AGO
Yes though its a different tag...nhcky.org instead of gmail
8 HR AGO
Makes it easier to share with other teachers who are teaching the same subjects
8 HR AGO
We can both add/edit things
8 HR AGO
That makes sense.
8 HR AGO
I will see if I can create decent PDF's of Life of Fred.
8 HR AGO
Thanks!
8 HR AGO
It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Basic algebra and even initial calculus intuitions are integrated (ha) into the elementary school books.
8 HR AGO
The elementary math we are using is called ‚ÄúGo math‚Äù which is less rote memorization and more why and how to apply
8 HR AGO
And you see basic algebra stuff as early as 1st grade
8 HR AGO
Googling now
8 HR AGO
The older teachers chaff at the new approach
8 HR AGO
I can imagine. Something similar occurs with how reading is taught in many classrooms.
8 HR AGO
So, how have you been spending your scarce free time?
8 HR AGO
[[AG]] decided she wanted to play WoW ‚Äîshe and [[UJ]] have dragged me back in
8 HR AGO
Oh, Signal works on phone and desktop/laptop, btw (you probably saw that already). I don't type so well on my phone (avoid it like the plague when I can).
8 HR AGO
haha, nice
8 HR AGO
you guys playing on the vanilla server?
8 HR AGO
Same server we were on ‚Äîzul‚Äôjin
8 HR AGO
That makes sense.
8 HR AGO
After 9 years ‚Äîrestared my old account
8 HR AGO
It has been a long time, lol.
8 HR AGO
It's about about 10 years for me since I played live. We played private servers in Thailand.
8 HR AGO
Been considering having [[j3d1h]] setup a private server for us. They don't seem to care for the grind, but WoW is a unique game.
8 HR AGO
Had an Authenticator on it to had to contact tech support
8 HR AGO
Oh, I lost mine too!
8 HR AGO
How's [[AG]] enjoying the experience?
8 HR AGO
I enjoy the grind and they changed it so that the zones mobs and quests are leveled to you. So I can do the zones I like and skip those I don‚Äôt
8 HR AGO
Ha, neat.
8 HR AGO
I assume they've streamlined the grind some. I played EQ2 for a few weeks, and they left  some exploits in the game that made it so you could PL to max level in a day. Hard to entice new players with the older grind.
8 HR AGO
[[AG]] is off and on ‚Äîshe makes a char, grinds to 20 and makes another
8 HR AGO
Yeah EQ was a major time sink
8 HR AGO
I have been searching for a friend in that game, Vannja Mann.
8 HR AGO
I like that I can get on WoW, do a few quests and get off
8 HR AGO
yes
8 HR AGO
Hmmm will look
8 HR AGO
I have found a couple old accounts of his sparsely on Le Interwebs, but everything is dead.
8 HR AGO
Maybe [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]]ah would like to play with [[AG]]
8 HR AGO
Dunno how private servers work
8 HR AGO
That is great idea.
8 HR AGO
Further complicated by Linux, but I've had WoW purring on Wine before (actually better FPS than I could with Windows on the same machine). Still, a good exercise for them.
8 HR AGO
I am curious how you hope to find Vannja, lol.
8 HR AGO
I have no plan...
8 HR AGO
ah, cool
8 HR AGO
I am headed to the store but I will be back later ‚ÄîLove ya
8 HR AGO
love you, will work on WoW now
8 HR AGO
LE EMAIL
1 HR AGO
Alliance or Horde?
1 HR AGO
All but one of char are horde ‚Äî[[AG]] likes both so doesn‚Äôt matter
1 HR AGO
You will have to help me with the private server thing ‚Äînever have done that
1 HR AGO
I actually thought it would be easier if I just got the kids onto live. I thought parts of the game were made free. Will have to check.
1 HR AGO
private is also cool though
1 HR AGO
Ok sounds good
1 HR AGO
Either way
1 HR AGO
I'm on right now: Shadowt
1 HR AGO
Zuljin?
1 HR AGO
Think so
1 HR AGO
My pally is Llucky
1 HR AGO
Alliance or horde?
1 HR AGO
added, horde
1 HR AGO
Will need time to get it setup for the chillun.
1 HR AGO
Np
1 HR AGO
[[K]]‚Äôs mom gave us a puppy in July...
1 HR AGO
Ah, what kind of dog is it?
1 HR AGO
She‚Äôs a lab/great dane mix and is now huge
1 HR AGO
what's her name?
1 HR AGO
That sounds like a huge dog, lol.
1 HR AGO
5 months old and bigger than our lab
1 HR AGO
Prim
1 HR AGO
She get excited and can jump straight from the floor to your lap thinking she is tiny
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
She‚Äôs sweet though ‚Äîand [[AG]]‚Äôs
1 HR AGO
For Christmas we are talking puppy training
1 HR AGO
I wonder if they learn not to jump.
1 HR AGO
Yeah, that makes sense, lol.
1 HR AGO
Prim because we were listening to the Hunger Games on vacation just before we got her
1 HR AGO
I have not read or watched it. Googling.
1 HR AGO
Movies were so-so the books were good
