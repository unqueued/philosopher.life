<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>At this point, I'm just letting the vids play silently through. I'm answering the commonsense questions and googling the googleable ones when necessary. Why waste my time? Sonya was correct: this is a waste for me. Cool. I'm glad she knows that. I appreciate that she has to cover her butt here.</p><hr><p>I was supposed to see the director at the school today, but it was a snowday (it was fine). I was not told not to come. Mr. Delp did not show. I called Sonya. She called Delp, and Delp called me. I'm far along in the accutrane bullshit; they were surprised by how far? <code>/facepalm</code> Okay. Also, I'm just supposed to complete what Sonya listed. That's fine. I AM getting paid for it, and I get to call the time for it. Neat. I guess 2-3 hours?</p><p>Anyways, if there is 2-hour delay tomorrow, then I don't show. They don't think there will be school (Sonya is clearly highly ranked, though it is a sad office from my inspection - the education system is in shambles). </p><p>Delp said he was interested in having me become the interim math teacher instead. He asked me what math I thought I could teach, and I kind of stupidly went as far as I felt comfortable (pre-cal and symbolic logic). I don't have the credentials required by the state, but I can be emergency certified. He wants me to certify over the summer (though I'm not convinced I can do so without special dispensation). Obviously, I am wildly overqualified, but I think it would a fucking blast to teach math. I adore the beauty of it. I also feel like I've done a damned good job with the kids here.</p><p>Last year, in the space of a couple months, I got my daughter (12) into calculus and statistics and my son through algebra 1 (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="FO.html">FO</a>L studies at 7yo with both helped significantly, obviously).</p><p>It is, of course, weird to teach in a public school but not believe it is the right choice for my children, as though I lack school pride (or whatever). The fact is that I think my children benefit more from their parents teaching them (as well as autodidacticism) than even an elite private school.</p><hr><p>Late text from Delp. It's on for Friday instead. He wants his techy boytoy there to help him.</p></div>
