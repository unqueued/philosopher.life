To not be an intuitionist, 

Intuitions between people conflict. 

Intuitionism seems to have a great deal in common with epistemic foundationalism (of which I'm quite fond). The problem is that we don't seem to have much agreement on moral foundations/intuitions as we might for more generic epistemic claims (a = a, p v ~p, etc.). Disagreement among moral intuitions seems to be a problem, as we want intuitions to be somewhat apodictic, obviously, self-evident, non-inferred, etc. 

If you deny intuitionism, what other options do you have left? Borrowing from epistemology, it seems that we either take on coherentism (which has its own problems) or some skeptical point of view (of which there are many analogous views in metaethics). 

----------------

This article went all over the place for me. There was a lot going on, and I fear I didn't understand it as much as I would like.

Rawls, reflective equilibrium, our intuitions matter

basic, non-inferentially knowlable principles of Rossian duty as grounded in considerations of value, values which are intrinisically good or bad, and which provide broadly positive or negative reasons for action (30-31)

Ross's theory presuposes that considerations of intrinsic value possibly ground duties, but certainly provide a way to see performance of duty as respecting or promoting something intrinisically good. (31-32)

Audi continues to say 'respect' that which is intrinisically good. That is interesting. I worry this is a kind of appraisal respect. Perhaps I'm jumping the gun, and I'm not being charitable in that worry though. He does continue to talk about &quot;production of what is intrinisically good&quot; and the opposite for the bad...this sounds like recognition respect. We take the intrinisic value of something to be the reason for acting or as at least partial grounds for our duty and/or motivation. (32)

Final duties determined by practical wisdom, acc. to Ross. Audi questions how we can specify the extent to which practical wisdom is applied if we take values as a basis for duties.

moral judgement need not be grounded in non-moral normative judgements (33)

Audi seems to be arguing that there is a possible foundation beneath &quot;being honest&quot; or &quot;avoiding injustice&quot; (33-34). We can continue a chain of question-asking, &quot;but why is that normative?&quot; or &quot;what justifies the normativity of X?&quot;. Ross is claiming that intrinisic goodness or badness can sometimes play this foundational role.  It is sometimes the real foundation.

Audi makes a point about the malicious man in pleasure, and how overall duty is not just a matter of the number of reasons we have, nor of the quantity of good we can produce (or bad we can avoid), but of how all relevant considerations fit together. (36-37). This &quot;all relevant considerations fit together&quot; (37) notion is curcial in understanding the strong prohibition of sacrificing one person for the sake of the general happiness. (37).

I feel like Audi is trying to quantify/specify practical wisdom in determining one's final duty. This is an interesting move (which I actually like), and one which most virtue-theorists would find unacceptable.

The word &quot;proof&quot; has a very technical and highly specific meaning to me. Audi should not use the word like this (it falsely lends more than it should). Maybe the word &quot;justify&quot; is better. Maybe a concept of rational acceptence is being used here. I don't know.

What justifies our reasons as deeply flawed, fallible, and finite creatures? This brings us very far into the realm of epistemology. Rationality comes in degrees, and we can only be responsible to the degree we can be rational. 

I have plenty of reasons to deny that intuitions are relevent. 

Articuluability of grounds, explanation, or justification. If this is always possible, then a generalized account of adequately grounded moral judgements can be produced. Virtue ethicists would hate this (Hursthouse). Against codifiability of moral judgements and justifications.

Ontic grounding (41)

Audi claims on 43: &quot;Actions performed from duty need not be performed with respect.&quot; That sounds completely wrong to me.

Is there are difference between acting from duty and acting from respect of a person? It is not so clear to me. I always have the nagging feeling (intuition, perhaps) that what we mean by respect (the important, recognition kind that we are really after in this class) really just is the same thing as being moral. Doing the right thing in a circumstance for the right reasons - simple as that. We might be tempted to think one way we can separate respect for the moral law and respect for persons is that we might find instances in which other people aren't factors in appropriate moral judgment. But, I come back to the notion of self-respect, and that alone would be enough to close any inkling of a gap between being moral and being respectful. Being moral just is respect for the right things. Sometimes we may enter into a language of respecting others, but this isn't different from being moral - it may just being a different way of viewing the same thing, a different facet or perspective of the same gem. I feel like we will accomplish much in this class if we can distinguish being moral from having respect for persons in a meaningful and significant way. (43)

Respect for the moral law, respect for people. Being moral. Odd locutions. Taking those things to be the ultimate reasons and motivations for acting in a particular way. Show me a case or where respect from the moral law can be pulled apart from respect for people. It isn't just that they lead to the same thing. At best, I think respect for people is just one step removed from respect for the moral law. 

Respect is being motivated by the right reasons to act in a particular way in a particular circumstance. 

Another question, if respect for persons is anything other than respect for the moral law, then why would it matter? Why should it be normative? Why should I ultimately care about it? 

Audi seems to separate motive of an action from mode of its execution. (43) I don't quite know what that means. His examples seem contrived to me. If respect is some attitude outside of the moral law, I don't see why it is important. Do I have control over this attitude? If so, and if it is normative, why wouldn't the moral law dictate that I have a certain attitude?

Keeping a promise in a mean spirit or patronizing attitude either is something outside of our control, it wasn't really keeping a promise as the moral law instructed. 

The respectfulness requirement isn't anything different from just being a part of the moral requirement. Respectfulness is a subset of considerations of the moral requirement. 

Respecting the relevent intrinsic value (45)




What do you mean by intrinsic value?
Isolation argument- world a and b same (no humans or anything, just nature), but b has a picasso in it. Is one more intrinisically more valuable than another?

----------------

Nagel, 

Value possibilities;
-has value
-we do value
-it ought to be valued

Realist side &quot;has value&quot;; subjectivist/relativist &quot;we do value; 

Need a different justification for why something ought to be lvaued, or you need a different justification. Nagel has a different justification.

Nagel, Gewirth as well, Dworking as well, popular by Korsgaard. 
Movement away from &quot;has value&quot; but rather &quot;ought to be valued&quot; on pain of contradiction. 



What is Nagel's argument&gt;?

We have the first personal, subjective reasons that motivate us to act in certain ways. We can't treat them as subjective, they have to objective. 

How does his argument differ from moral realism?

His argument:

Why should you not cause another person pain?


Steps:
Shift the action to yourself. Seeing someone else doing it, how would you like to have it happen to you?
Well, Iwould hate it. 
If you ahve to get from I would hate it, to nobody should betreated that way.


Imagine the experience. 
I would dislike it. (masochist countexample, but some might like it)
However, I would resent it. (83)

Dislike is subjective, but resenting is universal. 

I claim it to be objectively bad/wrong (84) [agent-neutral value]
You don't index it as 'Your pain is bad'- not bad because it is my pain, but rather it is bad as such, wherever it happens.

THerefore, everyone has a reason to avoid it, or not do it, (or to do it if it is objectively good)

---------------

Koorsgaard, for whatever you like

If you say Seahawks, you should commit yourself to saying everyone should like the Seahawks. 

-----------------


How does this differ from moral realism?

People dependent features. Self-dependent. If you weren't around to ask the question, it wouldn't be objectively wrong. It is a fact about people, but not a fact about people. 

Initially, there isn't really a difference. The difference is just epistemic. In the moral realism, you need to intuit directly. 

It is one thing to regard yourself as having value, and actually having value. When you make a sandwich, you assume your life is worth maintaining. But, you still don't quite have why you should regard others as having value. 




Could you convince hitler with this argument?

etiquette/convention rules vs. moral rules. I don't resent that someone used the wrong curtain colors. ONly feel resentment for moral issues maybe?? If resent and objectively wrong are always the same thing, then isn't that what we need to show????

Boxer hit, he resents it?

We can be wrong about what we shoudl resent? What should you resent? If we have a narrow definition of resent. Why do we resent something rather than merely dislike? You need a further grounding. What causes resentment?
