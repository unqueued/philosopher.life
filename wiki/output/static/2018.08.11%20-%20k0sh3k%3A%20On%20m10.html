HR basically gets to say, &quot;They're not immoral, they're just ignorant.&quot; So that when we want to acknowledge a moral failure in someone, we rewrite it as ignorance and therefore not immoral - infinigress into epistemic normativity peeled from moral normativity. So the problem with HR is that it's not a Socratic aphorism; it tries to corrupt it. Even in the MacIntyrian conception of virtue, virtue is knowledge - especially if you think knowledge doesn't require cognitive awareness, in some respects.  What's right re: Socrates' claim is that it includes moral knowledge as fundamental to moral virtue - that to know is to act, it is fundamentally a bridge b/t doxa and praxis. </p><p>K: &quot;But 'ought' implies 'can' - it isn't a moral failure if the person legitimately cannot reciprocate, and I'm not convinced everyone (C in particular) is in a mental place to do so.&quot;</p><p>H: The question is about how we can be contextualist about the Right. One of the primary driving freatures of contextualism seems to be a certainty in our subjectivism, in some respects - even physics seems to demonstrate that relative perspectives in observation are fundamental to not just howww we individually perceive the world, but in fact seem to alter physical realist itsself. Any sane philosopher is going to have to be a contextualist or at least answer the problem. How do we differentiatte different standards of the Right for each context? It's a problem of infinite complexity, and can only be answered  ultimately in some infinite manner or the unity o f the totalizing dialectic of reality - that seems to be the only thing that can give us the telos. I agree that there are ridiculoooooously large differences in what is morally required of each of us according the universalist standard of the Right. The particularlties of his context give rise to a radically different set of Hohfeldian rights and duties. So why or where should TFTT be changed?</p><p>K: &quot;I think it just needs to be clarified a bit - primarily for your own classification of particular individuals. A showing to  yourself of a way of grace/mercy in particular situations wherein a person cannot reciprocate but is not being immoral.&quot;</p><p>(Hanlon's razor is an aphorism expressed in various ways, including: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. It suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations (&quot;attributions&quot;) for human behavior and its consequences.)</p><hr></div>
