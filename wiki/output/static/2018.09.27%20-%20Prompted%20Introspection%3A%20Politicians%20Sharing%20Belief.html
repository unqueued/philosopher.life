<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">How do you feel about politicians openly sharing their religious beliefs?</h2><p>Of course I want to know what other people believe, especially those in power! Consider this study: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12535" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12535</a>. It's very clear that religious belief has a profound influence on their legislative, executive, and judicial duties. Of course, our epistemologies, especially about what matters most, is going to have this effect. </p><p>Naively, privacy belongs to the powerless. I think every person in power (politician, wealthy aristocrat, bureaucrat, etc.) should be obligated to lead completely open lives. The extent to which one has power should inversely scale to one's political privacy (because you definitely don't have the moral right in this case). They have NO right to power if we don't get to see the internals of their innerlives, behaviors, beliefs, finances, relationships, etc. Politicians (who aren't even the most powerful) should be making a sacrifice here and demonstrating who they are in good faith. They should be open to absurd amounts of scrutiny. We have a right to know who they are inside and out. We must hold them accountable!</p><p>Now, if you mean &quot;share&quot; as in proselytize, then I think the answer becomes far more complex. It depends on the nature of the faith. We all have axioms, but not all axioms are publicly defensible. My wife's Christian beliefs, ultimately, rely upon private reasons that have no bearing in public discourse except with those who already agree to her axioms (to be clear, I think we are only 1 axiom off from each other). Religious experience is not transmittable. What justifies an individual is often not fit evidence in larger dialectics with fundamental disagreement (we should be incredibly slow to grant it in most cases). I understand that expertise and trust are essential to our social fabric, but when you have a pulpit, stage, megaphone, media platform, or any mass communication tool, you better be bringing your best public reasons to the table (it's your moral obligation; it's part of practicing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>). I expect <em>The Statesman</em> to be a philosopher! Plato and Aristotle are screaming to us about it, and they are right! So, are you taking up faith in something that is cross-culturally acknowledgeable? Okay, good. Objective moral values are moral facts! That's what we are looking for and should be talking about, especially those in power.</p><p>Politicians should be open about what they believe and consistently provide non-rhetorical argumentation. Full stop.</p></div>
