<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Son, you learned to speak when you were 4. You were reading by 6. You are a late-bloomer. Many consider it a miracle that you are a functioning language-user at all. We have worked hard in this arena, and we will continue to develop the verbal and empathic algorithms necessary for your survival and thriving. </p><p>Remember that you learned Algebra 1 completely at the age of 9. Remember that you've been using rapidly learning how to use your computer for several years. </p><p>How many 10 years could have installed i3-manjaro from soup to nuts? You made the install USB, you did the partitioning wizard, you setup your preferences, you built your i3 config for yourself, you setup your services, autostarts, rsync-over-ssh backups, and installed the software you wanted. I refused to touch your computer. What 10 year old knows how to search for packages with yaourt, or knows when to sudo, or understands half of what you do about computers? You are very good at them for your age.</p><p>You know how to take care of yourself. You are maturing, and I'm glad to see it.</p><p>Keep working hard. </p><p>You are going to build a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Computing.html">Computing</a> area that you love to live in.</p><p>Autists tend to have very severe interests. Make your wiki your fundamental hobby.</p><p>Your goal, in a sense, is to know where to put things in your wiki and why. You want to categorize your life and model it well. Learn to read+write+talk with me like a digital socratic method.</p><p>My goal is to teach you how to write to yourself, how to organize your self-representation, and how to leverage it to improve your <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a>.</p><p>Autistically people tend to have a fairly private (perhaps not Wittgensteinly private) languages with themselves in crucial respects. I want to teach you the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Ithkuil.html">Ithkuil</a> of talking to yourself and modeling yourself. I want to teach you the kung-fu of becoming wise as an autistic person.</p><p>My goal, in a sense, is for your school day to be 8 hours of wiki. You build whatever you want, whatever you really believe is important on the wiki. I help you do it.</p><p>It can't be &quot;just DND,&quot; obviously.</p><p>This isn't going to magically happen over the course of a month. We're trying to give you a giant boost here in this practice. This is a radical workshop.</p><p>My goal is for it not to be hell for us to take lectures. We are going to talk and write on our wikis together hour after hour. We're studying together. I want to show you, with real practice, what learning is really really like. Your goal is to tell yourself stories well (think <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>). </p><p>It's like you are learning a radical language tool. This is a new frontier in human history. I must unleash your curiosity, creativity, and confidence.</p><p>We need to be able to be deeply literal with each other. Having similar models on our wikis will help us understand each other more quickly. We can communicate and empathize more effectively by having a similarly structured language. This is why I'm asking you to emulate my wiki.</p><p>Let us make each other exceptional.</p><p>Communicate your new visions of yourself to me. The wikis are like mind-melds, digital information highway webs...it's a series of tubes.</p><p>One of the ideas of being wiki-penpals for life came from Tolkien and his children.</p><p>I want our wikis to be representational lenses designed for maximizing empathy all the way down.</p><p>If you enjoy editing your character sheet in DND, you should definitely enjoy editing your actual character in real life.</p><p>Btw, I'm proud of your learning to type so quickly. That will be a very useful skill to you.</p><hr><p>Daughter, I expect you to just build things on your wiki. Anything. Make them grandiose. Be proud of them. Make them look and function how you want. Build structures and relationships, molecules and emergences. Show me how badass you really are.</p></div>
