<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>It was a very productive day. We studied advanced pipefitter math, which was just trigonometry. I found errors in the book. I'm going to have to learn how to speak &quot;pipefitter math&quot; in terms of set, run, and travel. I end up translating from the mathematical terms to the pipefitter terms. I'll get there. The teacher said we needed to bring our &quot;A&quot; game on the test after he checked it out. He even went over it with us and laughed that he couldn't pronounce the words on the exam. It went fine, of course. It was odd that Chris answered them quickly in the study session (when he knew the section we were looking at), but took a long time in the actual exam. </p><p>Nash was, surprisingly, studying on the new book as well. He told me that he had talked to a friend of his who graduated from this program and was told that people with NCCER certifications and pass the field test walk in as Top helper or pipefitter directly. That would be pretty sick. So, he decided to buckle down and do his work, kinda. That said, after he took his exam, the teacher brought him in the office and yelled at him. Nash doesn't actually try very hard, but he thinks he does.</p><p>I'm going to need to start studying at home more consistently to make sure I can do one a day. It's important that I push hard. </p><p>In any case, afterward, we went straight to the fabrication. This is taking a long time because we are studying all day for these tests. I had Nash tack because he needs something to do. It's clearly Chris and me who are the main workers on this project, and everyone else either doesn't want to participate or perhaps feels left out. I don't know what to say. Chris and I are not mean. They aren't jumping in. They aren't trying to understand where we are and figuring out how to join us. When I try to explain what we are doing, they don't seem interested. They are all screwing around welding. No one but Chris and I are actually pipefitting. They lounge. I hope I will do a better job of inserting and asserting myself into work in a polite and constructive fashion. I want to kick ass.</p><p>We cut a 90 elbow to make 45's since the others failed. We've got them fitted and tacked (mostly). It's coming along.</p><p>Also, my wife printed out my resumes, and they look beautiful. I need to find out where I'm applying to. I need to create a cheatsheet with all the pertinent, detailed information that I'll need for more extensive applications. I hope to apply to my first tomorrow.</p><p>Also, I stopped by to see Randy. He wasn't there. I'll keep trying.</p></div>
