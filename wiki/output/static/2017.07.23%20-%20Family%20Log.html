I learned a ton. I feel like I have a better understanding of my role and the landscape.</li><li>I'm really happy that our bank account has gone up for the second week in a row. It's stabilizing, and I'm happy to pick up things that we've been waiting to buy for a while now.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 class="">What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?</h2><ul><li>1uxb0x<ul><li>You are doing a good job of building friendships and dealing with (and thinking through) your conflicts.

Good job.</li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>I know you don't feel like you are good with money, but I've seen you grow a ton when it comes to financial responsibility. You really do plan ahead, sacrifice for us, and pass the marshmallow test as a mother and wife. I'm really thankful that you've taken the time and energy to become a financially responsible person. Thank you for forgiving my many mistakes in this respect as well; you've been gracious to me when I've failed us in this respect. I hope I can pay it back to you.</li><li>It's nice that you take the time to make treats for your dad's friends and acquaintances. </li><li>You taught me how to make coffee.
