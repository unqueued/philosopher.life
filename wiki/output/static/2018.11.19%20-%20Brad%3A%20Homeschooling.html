SUN 1:53 PM
Cool
SUN 1:57 PM
I'm sorry about that buddy but I wasn't trying to be rude
SUN 1:58 PM
No worries man =).
SUN 1:58 PM
I want to make decisions about what computer stuff I'll be buying on Black Friday.
SUN 1:59 PM
I heard that what's the plan so far
SUN 2:00 PM
Well, I need to know about the i9 machine
SUN 2:00 PM
that affects how I can reason about it
SUN 2:00 PM
Friday is probably when I would know for sure what I'd be doing
SUN 2:00 PM
Oh yeah there will be no i9, one of my dope head neighbors helped there self to it and several hundred dollars worth of parts I called the police and I do have it all recorded from my surveillance cameras but they want me to go through the footage and I don't even know when it happened to start looking but I will find it I am going to start going through it tonight
SUN 2:05 PM
ah, that sucks, sorry man
SUN 2:06 PM
I don't care about the stuff that is missing as much as It makes me worry about the neighborhood that we are living in though but hey I do have something that you might want though

SUN 2:22 PM
If you want the ghost card then come and get it for free
SUN 2:24 PM
Consider it for your time you wasted waiting on the missing pc
SUN 2:25 PM
What are you actually mad at me because I got robbed?
SUN 2:55 PM
Nope. I'm not mad, lol. I just went on a  walk with the family.
SUN 3:08 PM
My time's not wasted.
SUN 3:08 PM
I'll find another way.
SUN 3:08 PM
I'm sorry to hear you can trust your neighbors.
SUN 3:08 PM
can't*
SUN 3:08 PM
Good I'm glad to hear you are not mad at me but I have enough parts here to build your kids a gameing computer and I won't charge you for it I'll do anything that I can to help you
SUN 3:10 PM
I have a couple good gpus here to get you started if you want one
SUN 3:11 PM
I have to travel on Tuesday. Maybe I can come over tomorrow and we'll see what we can do, eh?
SUN 3:12 PM
10-4
SUN 3:12 PM
I am busy too on Tues but I have a Dr appointment on Monday but other than that I am open
SUN 3:13 PM
What time tomorrow would be best?
SUN 3:13 PM
Idk until in the morning when I call my Dr
SUN 3:14 PM
K
SUN 3:14 PM
I have a dinner I have to attend at 6:30, it'd need to be before then.
SUN 3:14 PM
We could also schedule for Friday.
SUN 3:14 PM
That would be great too whatever you want to do
SUN 3:15 PM
Tell me what you need to build them a PC and I will be working on it
SUN 3:16 PM
Dw it won't be junk
SUN 3:17 PM
Are you dead set against amd
SUN 3:18 PM
I am not deadset against AMD.
SUN 3:19 PM
I think decent GPUs are the hardest part.
SUN 3:19 PM
I have a new gigabyte fm2+ board
SUN 3:19 PM
We could use
SUN 3:19 PM
The only thing that you would need to buy is the cpu and a case unfortunately I gave away a new case the other day
SUN 3:21 PM
You can buy a used 6800k for about $50 and we can water cool it
SUN 3:22 PM
I have a semi modular psu we could use
SUN 3:22 PM
And gskill memory not much though
SUN 3:23 PM
I will help you with the cpu too if you don't have the money right now
SUN 3:30 PM
I appreciate it. I'm sure we'll find a way here. Where can you get a 6800k for $50?
SUN 3:31 PM
I think that that's ruffley what they cost on ebay maybe a 5800k then
SUN 3:35 PM
Well I found a 6800k for $70 I was $20 off
SUN 3:49 PM
Wait, you are talking about A10-6800k, lol.
SUN 3:50 PM
Derp
SUN 3:50 PM
That makes way more sense.
SUN 3:50 PM
I'm giving you a brand new mobo and memory and cpu so I think between the two of us we can find a cpu
SUN 3:51 PM
Yes. Everything you've said makes sense.
SUN 3:51 PM
Sorry. I'm not all here today. I've slept very poorly recently.
SUN 3:51 PM
I mean psu not cpu
SUN 3:51 PM
Yea I should have been more clear sorry
SUN 3:52 PM
They are great for gameing they just run a little hot but I have several water coolers
SUN 3:53 PM
We can use
SUN 3:53 PM
I just hate texting I wish we could talk on the phone some
SUN 3:55 PM
I'm too dumb for texting
SUN 3:55 PM
No you aren't, lol. I think you are doing fine.
SUN 3:55 PM
I'm sorry you hate it. You using Signal on your computer?
SUN 3:55 PM
No I'm at Walmart now
SUN 3:56 PM
Ah, well, I think you text better than I can. I'm practicing on becoming better at it.
SUN 3:56 PM
Someone got shot here today
SUN 3:56 PM
Jesus.
SUN 3:56 PM
U shouldn't say the lord says name in vane
SUN 3:57 PM
Ah, sorry. I meant no offense.
SUN 3:57 PM
It's bad for ya
SUN 3:57 PM
But we will put the little ones a PC togather
SUN 3:58 PM
Indeed. I'd like you to meet them too.
SUN 3:59 PM
Maybe we can have you over for dinner.
SUN 4:00 PM
If you want.
SUN 4:00 PM
I also got a nice razor rgb keyboard and mouse that I got on trade in this week its got a pass through cable on it and everything
SUN 4:00 PM
Yea that would be great
SUN 4:01 PM
OK I've got my Stylus out and I'm ready to try and keep up with you in typeing
SUN 4:02 PM
The last time I used a stylus was with a palm pilot decades ago. My daughter uses one with her digital drawing pad.
SUN 4:03 PM
Does it work nicely for converting handwriting to typing? (like OCR?)
SUN 4:03 PM
Yea it works its built into my phone
SUN 4:04 PM
Look at this
SUN 4:04 PM
https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F283264130798
SUN 4:05 PM
Neat.
SUN 4:06 PM
My daughter currently uses that exact case for her machine.
SUN 4:06 PM
(She is an excellent programmer for a 12 year old)
SUN 4:06 PM
We don't need it but it's a great deal
SUN 4:06 PM
Wow
SUN 4:07 PM
I bet you are proud
SUN 4:07 PM
Indeed. She works really hard, and it shows.
SUN 4:08 PM
We could get all of this for not much more than the cpu alone
SUN 4:08 PM
Homeschooling is the only advantage I can give them.
SUN 4:08 PM
Right
SUN 4:08 PM
You need to home school me now lol
