It helps if you have either no friends or digitally literate friends too. I agree that it requires physical infrastructure, digital literacy, and major time investments to own your data. Outside of that, I'm not so convinced I'm the privileged one. I think I'm the one who is sacrificing while most people continue to confabulate their route to convenience. I feel like I've been calling us to arms for a decade now, and for good reason. This isn't my fault, it's yall's. Alienation is the cost of sanity and righteousness.</p><p>Fighting against capitalism from within that system is extremely difficult, especially when nobody else cares enough to do it with you. Acting like those fighting capitalism (which is only a subset of the folks willing to leave FB) are the &quot;entitled&quot; folk isn't just missing the point, it's evading taking responsibility for one's actions. The Network Effect excuse here is &quot;well everyone else isn't doing it, so why should I?&quot; This is a matter of convenience, laziness, and selfishness. I realize, we lose hard in the prisoner's dilemma when few if anyone else will stand up and do the right thing. Sometimes you do the right thing when it costs you everything. </p><p>In a causal chain, we all &quot;rely&quot; upon FB to some degree. My issue is whether or not we are actively fighting against the degree to which we rely upon it. Note, of course, the difference between keeping a passive FB profile and actively using it. I have a LinkedIn profile, and that place is pure anathema to me. Possession really is different from use. You have to ask yourself, do I rely upon this out of true necessity or is it really just convenient privilege? To the extent it is the latter, I think you have a moral duty to find alternatives (even when it's lonely and difficult). You have to actively fight golem or it will devour you.</p><p>In regards to their solution of demanding more of FB through &quot;reform and regulation,&quot; the author's diplomatical ignorance is malicious at this point (and I say that with the utmost respect for the EFF, who in this case must couch the problem in a way that is neutral for the libertarians in Silicon Valley). We're in Nazi territory, and we must own up to that fact. Again, listen to the person who has been screaming about this problem since FB required an edu email address: centralizing power should be avoided at all costs, and censorship is unacceptable. We must control our filter-bubbles as a matter of autonomy. The author is correct that good solutions will require concerted, long-term efforts of nation-states and their citizens. Until then, I am convinced these costs, high as they may be, can be paid by almost everyone if they really wanted to. </p><p>Doing the right thing is a costly privilege.</p></div>
