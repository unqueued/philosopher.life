<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">If you were to die today what would like people to say about you?</h2><p>I guess it would depend on how I died. Did I take my own life? Was it a Darwin Award winning mistake? Was it protecting some innocent person? Was it an assassination of someone delusionally valued by the public? The vast majority of people wouldn't say anything about me because I'm nobody to them (and they truly don't care about nobodies). Those who do know me probably wouldn't be too surprised if I took my own life, but they might find my death tragic to varying degrees.</p><p>I think most people fundamentally do not understand me, even though they have every opportunity to do so with this wiki. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Litmus%2520Test.html">Wiki Litmus Test</a> has been a useful lens through which I can better understand how others think about how I think. In a crucial way, I think most people are retarded about what matters most; they really don't care about wisdom or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>. Most humans are barely persons.</p><p>Why should I care what these people would say? I seek the approval of the truest standard I can find.</p><p>I do care, of course, about my immediate family and all <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Others.html">The Others</a> (known and unknown to me). I care about the Kantian Kingdom of Ends. My tribe is hard to pick out from the world, but their salience is the only kind which matters to me. What would these people say?</p><p>I don't know. I also think it would take them time to process it. I have found over the years that some people require time to process their interactions and time with me. Some of them are glad to have known me, even if I was a polarizing person in their life. </p></div>
