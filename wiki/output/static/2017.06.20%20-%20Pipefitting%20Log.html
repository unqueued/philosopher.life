<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was interesting. Luke didn't really finish even drawing the simulator yesterday. I immediately started doing the measurements and checking for him. He got several things wrong. After they were fixed, he got copies of them. We drew out our spools. I did the math, and I had them check it. While they were checking, I looked around in the pipe yard for parts for another project.</p><p>I came back. They said they did the math, but I wasn't sure. I did the math again to double check. It was fine. They went to cut the pipe, and I worked on making a tool for myself. I made a flange wrench for myself. I just looked it up, and they go for $85. Mine turned out nicely. I used a solid steel bar and bolts. I had to do significant grinding to make them fit. I'm glad I made it! I've also got my solid steel bricks (1-inch thick!) marked and ready for cutting into alignment dogs. I think they are going to be pretty awesome. I'm considering making 8 instead of 4.</p><p>They still hadn't cut the pipe fully. I went straight to grinding the pipes. I did them all. I hit the valves we were given too. It's clear that I didn't remember much about valves. I need to re-read through these books again. It would be worth my time.</p><p>After lunch, we started fitting. While the setup was far longer than it should have taken, the actual fitting went very quickly. Chris and I banged it out. We have very little left to do tomorrow. One 90, a pipe, and some flanges. That's it. </p><p>I think it is possible we will be asked to do socket weld or possibly screwpipe for the 1&quot; simulator. We'll see. I think our teacher wants a pretty picture to &quot;show off&quot; to people looking at his program.</p></div>
