MON 12:58 PM
Lol. Sorry man. That sucks.
MON 12:58 PM
Fixed. No idea why it turned off. Sorry I missed all your messages!
MON 12:58 PM
I was just thinking this AM, ‚ÄúDamn [[h0p3]] must have been super busy these past few weeks.‚Äù :joy:
MON 12:59 PM
It is true. Lol. I assume we've both been super busy.
MON 12:59 PM
You start up school this week?
MON 1:00 PM
Yep! First day is today. :) Native American Religion is SUPER COOL and my American Lit: 1960- Present seems like it‚Äôll be really fun.
MON 1:00 PM
Got Greek Mythology after lunch and writing theory tomorrow.
MON 1:01 PM
I continue to be insanely envious. I love the sound of every class you are taking.
MON 1:01 PM
I owe you my last Mysticism paper still. Sorry I never got around to sending it your way. Is your gmail okay for that?
MON 1:02 PM
yeah, sounds great
MON 1:02 PM
When we meet up next I would love to tell you all about these classes
MON 1:02 PM
Yes. =) I would love that.
MON 1:02 PM
Christmas and New Years were great. Got to meet up with a lot of family and friends. I regret not being able to make our visit down there work, but we‚Äôll figure something out soon I hope!

2018 was honestly a pretty good year for me which is amusing because the general consensus of strangers online is that it was an awful year. I still think outrage culture goes too far (for some cases) and I‚Äôm hoping 2019 can leave that behind. 

In 2019 I really want to be better about keeping promises. If I say I‚Äôm going to do something I want to do it. I also want to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to things that I can‚Äôt reasonable keep up with or have no desire to keep because last year was absurdly busy and I would like to make more time for people that I miss. Hence why I opened signal back up. Haha.
MON 1:05 PM
But overall I‚Äôm great. How are you and [[k0sh3k]] and the kids?
MON 1:05 PM
We look forward to seeing you too. =)
MON 1:06 PM
What do you mean by outrage culture? Why do you think outrage culture has gone too far, and how (and why) should it be left behind?
MON 1:07 PM
(I think I know what you are saying; I think it will be worth thinking very carefully about it.)
MON 1:07 PM
I like your resolutions. Those are not easy things to do. I'm grateful you opened Signal up too! =)
MON 1:08 PM
I was about to hop onto another medium to ping you.
MON 1:08 PM
We're doing well.
MON 1:08 PM
Working hard. Playing magic has been wonderful.
MON 1:08 PM
Still grinding like a madman on the wiki.
MON 1:08 PM
Our jobs are becoming more normalized, I think.
MON 1:09 PM
It's been stressful, but I'm not sure it can be not stressful (just not &quot;as&quot; stressful) given the circumstances.
MON 1:09 PM
So I‚Äôll give three examples with the same basic structure. 2018 saw a lot of people digging through old tweets and social media posts to our people today who have changed their lines of thinking and evolved over the years to a point that they no longer reflect their old self. Twitter fiascos like [[JRE]] Gunn, Dan Harmon and recently Kevin Hart are ones that come to mind. I think those controversies have wide shades of grey and are also wholly independent of each other in lengths both sides go. But the fact that people have had to pay the price for old ways of thinking despite context or disavowing their past self sets an incredibly dangerous precedent that even has me checking my old Facebook posts and deleting things that could be used against me.
MON 1:17 PM
I‚Äôve missed a sense of normalcy. Just going back to work today made me feel really good.
MON 1:18 PM
Some people deserve it. Some of the ones I mentioned may too but it‚Äôs the future of online witch hunting that has me deeply concerned.
MON 1:19 PM
You mean outrage culture in this very narrow sense of being responsible for our identities and failing to model others charitably, and nothing more?
MON 1:21 PM
You raise an excellent point.
MON 1:21 PM
I think it‚Äôs good that people get up in arms about what they believe in
MON 1:21 PM
But things like this?
MON 1:22 PM
Just seems petty haha
MON 1:22 PM
Perhaps.
MON 1:22 PM
Forgiveness is complex.
MON 1:22 PM
Sometimes disavowel is another and sometimes restorative justice demands more work of us in the [[T42T]] game.
MON 1:23 PM
I can see why we might be slower to trust individuals who ever made those mistakes in the first place. Of course, we have to give them a real chance to demonstrate they aren't those people any more.
MON 1:23 PM
I think we should hold each other accountable to what we've said, who we've been, etc. It is an act of autonomy to dissociate ourselves from who we were, and that is something we have to hold each other accountable to as well.
MON 1:25 PM
Witch hunting is difficult. I suppose it depends on what we mean by it.
MON 1:25 PM
I think we are conceptually bound to having outgroups. It's inescapable. I think you must choose your outgroups morally and as rationally as possible.
MON 1:25 PM
And of course we should rally against the neo nazis
MON 1:26 PM
But a man that made a controversial cartoon for a laugh?
MON 1:26 PM
Sent you my essays btw!
MON 1:27 PM
Thank you =)
MON 1:27 PM
Of course!
MON 1:27 PM
This is something I think about a lot when I model others in my wiki. I literally search who they are online given the information they've provided me. I do look for the signs they've changed their mind and context (even if they aren't overt in it).
MON 1:27 PM
Not everyone does that, I realize.
MON 1:28 PM
But, it seems to me that genuine relationships are going to require accountability that might sometimes be called witch hunts and outrage culture. I appreciate that you say it has shades of grey. I agree.
MON 1:29 PM
I agree with your thoughts too. I try to approach all situations from multiple sides without external bias.
MON 1:30 PM
One worry I have is that we are engaged in a game of eliminating transparency, failing to be ourselves, working to build manipulative brands, and entering spirals of silence. I think you are pointing to that too.
MON 1:32 PM
I wrestle with the thing you are talking about (it can be a haunting issue), since my avatar online is (sounds arrogant) uniquely rich. I keep daily snapshots (e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://philosopher.life/) for maximizing my transparency. I guess my goal isn't to protect myself from the masses, but to give myself the opportunity to point out to an individual who is going to take the time to speak with how the wiki (and myself) have evolved. I do change my mind, and I like being able to give evidence of it.
MON 1:34 PM
In the end, I think a society that actually practices [[The Golden Rule]] with each other will likely act on that maxim (even though it will require working hard to secure privacy otherwise against the digital giants).
MON 1:35 PM
Being honest and kind (which doesn't mean NICE) online is hard. I think you are making the case for that. I appreciate it.
MON 1:36 PM
Yeah but the world is getting worse especially with social media. So who knows? I envy you for being so much off the grid. I couldn‚Äôt do it. Haha
MON 1:47 PM
I do not blame social media conceptually, only how it is currently used (and controlled, to whatever extent it can be). I agree the world is getting worse. The Crisis of Capitalism is upon us. Ironically, it is only by binding ourselves together through effective communications (including the remoteness of social media) do we have a chance to defeat the monster. The feeling of the inevitability of the world getting worse with respect to social media is due to that catch-22.
MON 1:51 PM
It's hard to convince people to take their technology seriously enough.
MON 1:51 PM
I know it's very hard work.
MON 1:51 PM
I was only half serious. But I do think things like this specific instance are inherently flawed and morally problematic.
MON 1:52 PM
Agreed. The inherent flaw just is the people and the principles they live by. Outrage culture that fails to attempt to be charitable (forgivingly retaliating) in interpreting and modeling others are engaged in Tit-For-Tat ([[T4T]]) reasoning; they are playing a zerosum game. I do not know how to convince people to play by the game of life with the [[T42T]] strategy.
MON 1:54 PM
To me it truly feels like a lost cause. People are incredibly afraid of saying the wrong things or making a mistake. It‚Äôs like walking on eggshells all the time. But I also feel like this next generation will be really interesting to observe once they get to my age, and yours too. They grew up where things like this are normal.
MON 1:56 PM
And they may or may not already be slotting into this mentality.
MON 1:56 PM
I think part of the issue is convincing people that their tools (including their computers, data, and digital identities) are extensions of themselves.
MON 1:57 PM
Hm.
MON 1:57 PM
So, I think people should be incredibly afaid of saying the wrong things or making a mistake. Outrage culture, as you have defined it, is failing to do that. They aren't afraid of saying the wrong things and making mistakes at all.
MON 1:57 PM
Being moral is about walking on eggshells, being hyperaware of the feelings and reasons of others, integrating them into our own. Radicaly empathy is going to require an extreme perspective, imho.
MON 1:58 PM
I think most people are afraid to say &quot;wrong things&quot; not in terms of whether or not it is moral, but in terms of whether or not it benefits them.
MON 1:59 PM
Of course, I have a hard time finding places to have real discussions with people.
MON 2:00 PM
I agree the odds are completely against us. I fear we cannot give up though. If we don't try, we really have already lost.
MON 2:00 PM
It's been interesting to see my middleschoolers reason about their lives in digital spaces. I am listening as best I can.
MON 2:03 PM
In the end, I think resolution of disagreements and unifying ourselves in a stable (and moral) society requires an openness to discussions like ours, a willingness to reconsider our identities, and a pursuit of charity (in terms of time, emotional energy, and money) that most people selfishly do not pursue.
MON 2:07 PM
Well said [[h0p3]]. :)  I think you present a very logical argument that doesn‚Äôt completely discount others and presents good opportunity for fostering better relationships. I‚Äôll think hard about what you‚Äôve said to me.
MON 2:58 PM
Greek Mythology is AWESOME by the way. I‚Äôm finally going to be reading the Iliad and the Odyssey. Bout time. 

Speaking of- I‚Äôve been keeping a list of books for my classes. Don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôd consider poking around for me sometime later yeah?
MON 2:58 PM
Of course, send me a list of what you want or need.
MON 3:03 PM
Just a sec.

MON 3:05 PM
My last class meets for the first time tomorrow so I‚Äôll likely ask again... as always I really appreciate the help.
MON 3:05 PM
Also I forgot to ask, but how did *you* feel about 2018 and what are your goals in 2019?
MON 7:01 PM
Ouch, I got maybe half of them, lol. I can find copies of Homer, but not that one.
MON 10:51 PM
They are in the sync.
MON 10:51 PM
2018 was productive and extremely difficult. It continues to get harder. We survived.
MON 10:53 PM
I was able to maintain a sense of purpose, and I'm grateful for that.
MON 10:53 PM
Resolutions wise: https://philosopher.life/#2018%20Resolutions:%5B%5B2018%20Resolutions%5D%5D%20%5B%5B2019%20Resolutions%5D%5D
