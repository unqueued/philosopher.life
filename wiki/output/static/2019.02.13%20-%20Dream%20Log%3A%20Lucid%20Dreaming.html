<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>Apparently, I am wrong again. Surprise! This is useful.</em></p><p>I've been waking up in stages. I finally understood what was happening this morning. I've fallen asleep to <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em> running many times, never turned it off, Kodi keeps moving to the next episode, but I hear nothing. Eventually, I can hear myself talk, and further, I can remember it! The state machine conversation I previously had with myself was during some phase of sleep. Here's the cool part: I've been &quot;awoken&quot; suddenly by the sound of <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em> coming out of the TV. I have absent-mindedly assumed it was me (fumbling in my sleep) or the cat clumsily hitting the spacebar; this was confabulation. No! </p><p>What has happened is that my brain's automation has turned off sending the percepts of the low-volume quiet sound of <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em> to my dreamstate, but eventually the conditions were ripe enough for me to be startled into hearing it. I talking to myself in my sleep while being deaf to the sound of the television, I believe this is a kind of lucid dream. I'm doing my usual inner-monologging (:P), and I can clearly hear myself. All of the sudden, I am awakened to the injection of the sound that is external to my body. The sound of the TV comes rushing into my perceptual field, I suggest breaking my lucid dreaming. It wasn't as though the sound wasn't there the whole time; no, indeed, <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em> had been on all night. Rather, system 1 non-autonomously and automatically elected (a probabilistic threshold met, a non-conscious inference) to release that information into my Ego tunnel's phenomenology in that moment. One moment I am only attending to the sound of my inner voice, and the next I'm attending to both my internal monologue sound (though that is also externally describable) and the external sound.</p><p>Of course, I could still be wrong. Maybe there are gaps. I can't say for sure my phenomenology is accurate. I can only report what I think I heard. Just because it felt real doesn't mean it is real. I also appreciate how reconstructing dreams are almost always confabulations. Ugh. Still, that's what I got. I've gotta think about it.</p></div>
