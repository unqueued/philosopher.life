<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Using 10 words, describe yourself.</h2><p>Okay, I'm not writing my words yet. I'm just trying to understand the prompt first. Do you mean, write a 10-word phrase(s) that describes me, or do you mean pick 10 individual words which I would use to describe myself? I think the 10 individual words make the most sense. The 10-word elevator speech (more like passing you in the hallway) seems awful.</p><p>Furthermore, who am I describing myself to? Descriptions attempt to relay information to a specific audience, and thus descriptions are particularistic (at least good ones are). There's a huge difference between my ELI5, ELI12, ELI-College-educated, ELI-Expert, and so on, explanations or descriptions of a phenomenon, objects, etc. Who am I providing this description for? Myself? I am having a conversation with myself here, after all.</p><p>Vitally, note the difference between how I describe myself and whether or not I've accurately described myself. Describing who I want to be is also different from describing who I take myself to be. </p><p>Of course, we have serious metaphysical problems in even defining the self. Identity is just not simple. As usual, I have no answers besides some hand-waving assumptions (which make me throw up a little inside, but I will be stoic because it is the only practical option available to me). </p><p>Lastly, why am I describing myself? What is the goal here? Am I trying to cheer myself up? Am I am trying to &quot;be real&quot; with myself, using honest appraisal to investigate myself? Or is it something else? What's the purpose of the description? Without knowing the purpose, I fear I can't write an effective one. Let's assume the &quot;be real&quot; purpose is the goal. </p><p>My words in no particular order:</p><ul><li>Sensitive<ul><li>I consider it the root of my intelligence, awareness, belief system, perspective, desire formation, etc. I'm far more sensitive than the average person. This can be good sometimes, and other times it can be bad. As usual, the two-edged sword analogy comes out to play.</li></ul></li><li>Intuitive<ul><li>I'm extremely reliant upon my guttural, visceral, faster-acting, sometimes innate but usually habituated, blink-of-an-eye, virtue-theoretic, thought patterns. I rely upon my intuitions. Yet again, this can be a two-edged sword. Habituate wisely.</li></ul></li><li>Ethical<ul><li>I demand perfection where applicable.  Where there are obligations, I expect them to be met (even though I rarely predict they will be met). It's an easy and unfortunately vitally necessary way to be disappointed in humanity and myself. I can't call it a two-edged sword in any normative way. I can only say that my pursuit of it has often been off track. The cost of justice, of course, is sometimes our flourishing. We can be marred by it.</li></ul></li><li>Philosophical<ul><li>I'm a philosopher. I seek the truth and integrity. The costs can be very high. The rewards, I hope, even higher. </li></ul></li><li>Existential<ul><li>I deeply desire meaning and purpose. I cannot escape my plight. I must know who I am, who I was, and who I will be. More importantly, I must know why. </li></ul></li><li>Obsessive<ul><li>I pour myself into my projects. I believe it shortens my lifespan, often means I neglect other important duties and requires significant management. I have to wisely channel my obsessiveness. Admittedly, I am not often good at it. I adore the grind, the tunnel-vision, and being there. I'm chemically dependent upon it. </li></ul></li><li>Computational<ul><li>I adore computers. I see minds as computers. I see reality as being computational in nature. It is a lens, a tool, and a state of mind for me. I am a computer.</li></ul></li><li>Eccentric<ul><li>This is perhaps too kind a word. I'm more like an alien to humanity, an autistic rather than psychopathic one. Let's be honest: I'm weird. I'm really, really weird. Even weird people tend to think I'm weird. I try to embrace it. There are many forces which make that hard to do, and I feel punished for it (if not exploited). </li></ul></li><li>Complex<ul><li>I'm difficult to understand and appreciate. I mean that without arrogance, and I realize a lot of people's gut instinct would be to take me down a peg or two upon hearing my words which they believe lack humility. I have to be honest though. It is not easy to empathize with me, and complexity is part of the reason.</li></ul></li><li>h0p3ful<ul><li>I am h0p3. </li></ul></li></ul><p>I think it is important to see that these words are deeply related to each other. There is enormous overlap, intersection, and interaction between these descriptors for me. This is part of the coherence of my identity.</p></div>
