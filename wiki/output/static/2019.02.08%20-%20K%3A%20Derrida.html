FRI 8:42 AM
You too! =)
FRI 10:17 AM
What you up to today?
FRI 10:17 AM
School, then my brother and his fiancé are coming up for games, alcohol, and staying over.
FRI 10:56 AM
And you? :)
FRI 10:56 AM
I could not be more envious. That is literally the dream.
FRI 10:57 AM
Lol!
FRI 10:57 AM
Oh yeah. I was supposed to run a session for them, but I think I need more time to write first... I’m not happy with what I’ve prepared for tonight.
FRI 10:58 AM
I'm working on my cover letter still, working, taking care of [[k0sh3k]], and homeschooling. Seems like a good day. =)
FRI 10:59 AM
Still haven't had my coffee, but I'll be fixing that asap.
FRI 10:59 AM
What you've covered New Criticism in theory. What else?
FRI 10:59 AM
I think I need a second cup myself. Haha
FRI 11:41 AM
=)
FRI 11:41 AM
We talked about a practice called structuralism and even looked into Derrida’s concept of deconstruction.
FRI 11:41 AM
Interesting guy. Derrida
FRI 11:41 AM
Jacques Derrida. A French philosopher.
FRI 11:42 AM
=)
FRI 11:42 AM
Yeah, he's interesting.
FRI 11:42 AM
One of my professors was a decorated student of his.
FRI 11:42 AM
I can't say I understand much about Continental philosophy, but I want to.
FRI 11:43 AM
Just listening to him talk about Deconstruction in his documentary “Derrida” was a strange experience. I got nothing out of the film, and I didn’t even really understand the concept until after the lecture
FRI 11:45 AM
I get why she wanted us to know of it because it could be beneficial to our understanding of literature.
FRI 11:45 AM
New Criticism onto Critical Theory
FRI 11:46 AM
But I think this could have been presented better than “What is deconstruction?” “Well there’s not really a definition...”
FRI 11:46 AM
Wha?
FRI 11:46 AM
I think of Derrida as being part of another way of doing philosophy of language.
FRI 11:46 AM
I hate to say it, but I am not convinced it is a theory of meaning that is meaningful in the end.
FRI 11:47 AM
I agree with you. :joy:
FRI 11:47 AM
It was ultimately a waste of time for me.
FRI 11:47 AM
Like I get it.... but we could be using this time on something more tangible.
FRI 11:48 AM
Perhaps. I can say I have met highly intelligent (even brilliant) people who hold Derrida in high regard.
FRI 11:48 AM
It turns out that answering Derrida with something more tangible is much harder than it looks, imho.
FRI 11:48 AM
I might just not be smart enough to properly appreciate it.
FRI 11:48 AM
I agree.
FRI 11:48 AM
Even if studying it in the classroom to warn you that can't be the fitting answer to where you should go in the desert, I'm glad you jumped into it. It's a short waste of your time, but it will add up. You clearly care too much about the meaning of stories not to wrestle with that demon/angel in the desert.
FRI 11:50 AM
If you continue down the theory path, this problem only grows larger.
FRI 11:51 AM
Your theory class, btw, sounds difficult but worthy.
FRI 11:51 AM
You would love it I think.
FRI 11:51 AM
I would be ranting all day!
FRI 11:52 AM
I feel like I’m talking to you when I talk to my professor sometimes. :joy:
FRI 11:52 AM
Lol. =)
FRI 11:52 AM
In any case, at the end of the day, I want to be able to use this knowledge to find merit in the media that I consume and create.
FRI 11:53 AM
That reminds me
FRI 11:53 AM
I’m STILL wrestling with your question of finding the ultimate music. And I think I’ve discovered a good way to properly define what makes a perfect song
FRI 11:53 AM
fuck yeah, that is an excellent approach; it's very constructive.
FRI 11:54 AM
You have my attention, sir!
FRI 11:54 AM
I created a guilty pleasure playlist on YouTube. The criteria for being on it is simple. 

1. It came out between 1990ish and now. 

2. I actively avoided the music because A,B,C. 

3. I would be ashamed if I were caught listening to it by someone specific.

4. It is outside the range of what I normally listen to/ what I define my palate to be. 

5. Despite 1-3, it is worth listening to even if I haven’t decided what that is yet.
FRI 11:56 AM
For funsies, here it is. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG1843oJP5Aa_r7gHh6vQENs_YW25al-n
FRI 11:56 AM
I think understanding why these songs are worth listening to will help me find the old standard to which to your question.
FRI 11:56 AM
Because some of these are just shameless. :joy:
FRI 11:57 AM
------------------------------------------
FRI 11:57 AM
REDACT THIS h0p3!
FRI 11:57 AM
Lol
FRI 11:58 AM
You are among the elite on my wiki. I see it as my soft-obligation (even just cordial preference) to protect your identity. That playlist is going to be parsed into the constitutive songs (though I'm grateful to have the unified playlist, obviously). I won't be posting it directly into [[Music Exploration]] or allow it to remain in the chatlog.
FRI 11:59 AM
Alright, thank you for putting so much time and energy into this. I'm so grateful!
FRI 12:00 PM
Oh this isn’t that list. This is a list to help me understand making your list.
FRI 12:01 PM
Aye, it's not the ultimate. It does have a standard of the good though, guilty pleasure, right?
FRI 12:02 PM
It's a dialectical stepping stone to iterating your way close to the answer, as I understand.
FRI 12:03 PM
I think it's awesome that you give a shit about your music to the point that you want to know why it matters to you, what makes it worthy, etc. I think it is extremely philosophical and ethical about the aesthetic.
FRI 12:04 PM
It might not feel absurdly rigorous to you (though I don't seem to find others who care nearly as much as you), but I applaud the intention and the method!
FRI 12:05 PM
I'll be listening and thinking about you.
FRI 12:05 PM
Why 1990 as a cutoff point?
FRI 12:06 PM
I'm curious to know what counts as A,B,C
FRI 12:06 PM
(3) is fascinating. Shame is a powerful device in our lives. Some kinds of shame are justified and others aren't, imho. Are you including all kinds of shame, or only those which you believe you can objectively justify?
FRI 12:07 PM
(4) is curative, exploration, and empirical! I think it's fascinating you went this direction. I would like to know why.
FRI 12:08 PM
(5) is your gut instinct, and that is probably the more personal of them all, the hardest to articulate, and it's open-ended
FRI 12:09 PM
Also, I enjoy your list.
FRI 12:45 PM
I just invoked Taoism to analyze a poem in class. Haha. 

I’m gonna grab that cup of coffee then give you a good response to all of this. :)
FRI 12:57 PM
I would love to see the Taoist analysis too, btw.
FRI 12:58 PM
Music is INCREDIBLY important to me. I can't even begin to explain why I take it so seriously. In many ways, it's an aspect of who I am and I wouldn't be the man I am today without it. And thanks! I'm not sure I can give you a definitive, unbiased list until I work through these songs (and the playlist keeps growing too.)

1990 is the cutoff just because I was born in 94. I have great appreciation for the music that came before me, but a lot of this I came across just growing up as my musical identity took shape. I feel like I was incredibly biased toward certain types of music and as a result missed out on SO MUCH GOOD MUSIC!!! 

The A,B,C are reasons why I avoided them, such as the Backstreet Boys, who I believed in my naivety, that boy bands were only for girls. B and C follow similar trains of thought.

3) All of the shame! I am a huge hater of Maroon 5, yet I love the song I have from them in this playlist. I want to know why I feel the way that I do.

4) The whole road I've taken to reach the apex of my musical taste is uneven. I don't really listen to much genrewise of what I currently have in the playlist. As a result, it feels out of character for me since it doesn't fit in with the rest. I want to understand the dissonance between my guilty pleasures and what I consider to be &quot;good music&quot; and hopefully reconcile them.
FRI 1:22 PM
Glad you enjoy the list! ^_^

So this is a collection of poetry by Kristen Prevallet, and it was primarily composed as a conceptual collection of poems written in response to her father's suicide.
FRI 1:23 PM
The poem I shared above is one of balance/ harmony in nature, karmic retribution, and deeper understanding of the natural order of the world. The reference to dharma, and the Dow (stock market) led me to believe that this poem is deeply rooted in Taoist principle, and I used that to analyze the poem as I did.
FRI 1:24 PM
Sidenote: got signal on my laptop too so I can chat with you during class. ;)
FRI 1:26 PM
Noice!
FRI 1:31 PM
I love how having a multi-device messenger that I can remotely trust.
FRI 1:31 PM
Getting it on my laptop is long overdue.
FRI 1:33 PM
But yeah I think I responded to all of your points!
FRI 1:33 PM
Thank you! I will be thinking about it.
FRI 1:33 PM
Grinding through the list before I tackle it.
FRI 1:34 PM
I'm also taking up recommendations on the way, just to see how it clusters.
FRI 1:34 PM
I'm going to need a while to get through it all, lol. Will be several hundred songs by the time I'm dong.
FRI 1:34 PM
done* lol
FRI 1:34 PM
There's no rush!
FRI 1:34 PM
I'm continually adding more
FRI 1:35 PM
One comment though
FRI 1:35 PM
Matchbox 20 is GREAT
