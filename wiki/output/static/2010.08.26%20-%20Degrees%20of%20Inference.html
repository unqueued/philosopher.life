<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Brandom explained in his introduction that inferentialism coincides with a holistic account of semantics (as opposed to an atomic one).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> He is clear to point out that the mastery of any one concept requires the mastery of many concepts, an idea echoed by semantic holism.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button></p><p>One of the possible difficulties to be encountered in a strong version of semantic holism (and a version of inferentialism which uses it) is that the implications of any particular thing or concept may theoretically infer everything or every concept in the universe. There are webs upon webs of inferences to be made, and it seems possible (if not very likely) that to grasp a concept, and thus all the concepts inferred (and all the concepts inferred by those, etc.), one may need to grasp all possible concepts. If this were true, and assuming none of us are omniscient, then we couldn‚Äôt really grasp any concept (or else we‚Äôd have grasped them all). Of course, there can be exceptions to escape from such an absurdity. Brandom indirectly pre-empts such an absurdity when he says, ‚ÄúFor grasp of one concept consists in mastery of at least some of its inferential relations to other concepts.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button></p><p>One solution, perhaps, could be the possibility of ‚Äòsmall packages‚Äô of concepts which circularly help to define and infer each other, remaining independent of and non-inferred by all other concepts outside the package. (I‚Äôd like to see an example of this because I‚Äôm doubtful this is even possible). Such a package, of course, could be understood in its entirety, without requiring omniscience. There may be problems in even attempting to support the idea of ‚Äòconcept packages‚Äô as such because we‚Äôd need to rule out the possibility of any sort of concept which is universally inferred by all other concepts (a possible example this being the concept of a concept). Additionally, it seems (at the very least) awkward to define what it means to ‚Äòlearn‚Äô or ‚Äòacquire‚Äô concepts in such packages. It doesn‚Äôt seem plausible that my acquisition of a particular concept requires that I‚Äôm learning an entire set of concepts simultaneously.</p><p>It seems that one may never ‚Äòfully‚Äô grasp an actual concept from a strict or extreme application of semantic holism. I don‚Äôt see a problem with this though, as I think it is a good thing to suggest that I can conceive of something without inferring absolutely everything which can/should be inferred about the concept. I posit that the process of beginning to grasp a concept isn‚Äôt some modular switch, whereby you either grasp the concept (and its inferences, and so on) in its entirety or you don‚Äôt understand the concept at all, but rather that concepts can be grasped in degrees. This could pave the way for a more practical approach to envisioning how we can grasp a concept (without thereby being forced to grasp all concepts). Brandom seems to agree:</p><p>Understanding or grasping a propositional content is here presented not as the turning on of a Cartesian light, but as practical mastery of a certain kind of inferentially articulated doing: responding differentially according to the circumstances of proper application of a concept, and distinguishing the proper inferential consequences of such application. This is not an all-or-none affair; the metallurgist understands the concept tellurium better than I do, for training has made her master of the inferential intricacies of its employment in a way that I can only crudely approximate. Thinking clearly is on this inferentialist rendering a matter of knowing what one is committing oneself to by a certain claim, and what would entitle one to that commitment.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button></p><p>Inferentially-speaking, this would amount to only partial grasps of concepts, the degree of one‚Äôs grasp of a concept perhaps partially (or even largely) defined by the extent of the web of inferences that is also (to some degree) grasped. This seems like a more realistic approach to grasping concepts, especially as we encounter a diversity of valid opinions/conceptions about particular concepts. We might say that differing grasps of a concept between persons is based upon having different degrees of inference. This also helps to solve the awkwardness of the acquisition of concepts, as it would not require the simultaneous acquisition of concepts as a set or a whole.</p><p>Admittedly, I have no idea what the calculus for a ‚Äòdegree of inference‚Äô system might look like. I‚Äôm not even sure what entirely such a thing would entail. But I am conceiving it; I think I have at least part of this particular concept (whether or not it truly exists). Would not my degree of inference on this very system be more acceptable if I didn‚Äôt have to understand everything that was entailed or to be inferred?</p><p>Also, what does it mean to have a false conception? What does it mean to be wrong, to think one has a grasp of a concept, but to be incorrect? What if you got part of it right, but some of it wrong?</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Robert B.
