They texted me last night that they were down for a get together (I gave them carte blanche on scheduling). We had a pizza party, played Cards Against Humanity (my daughter won). It was excellent. We stayed up late into the evening, ~1:30am, talking. </p><p>She is an ex-bank employee who code-switches hard. She currently is one of &quot;The Help&quot; for the daughter of an extremely wealthy family in the area. She is contending with sexual child abuse of the kids she takes care of. </p><p>Esteban is a kid from the hood, down to earth, funny, and we got on excellently. We learned their life stories. </p><p>These folks are clearly sensitive to classism and racism they experience here in TN. I can see it.</p><p>Her brother couldn't make it, but we learned more about his epilepsy and autism. Hopefully, Matthew and I can be friends.</p><pre><code>We wanted to thank you again for having us over! We enjoyed every
