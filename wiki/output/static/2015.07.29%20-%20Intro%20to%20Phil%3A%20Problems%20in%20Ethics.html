It‚Äôs bad for us when you monopolize it. We break the monopoly, or at least take over the monopoly for ourselves.</p><p>You kill 5k people, and destroyed some symbolic buildings?</p><p>One cause, two or more effects.</p><p>Intend the good effect, don‚Äôt intend the bad one.</p><p>You are only responsible for what you intend.</p><p>Is that how intention really works?</p><p>Proportionality of Response</p><p>Can‚Äôt nuke a country when sending 1000 soldiers would be more fitting and do the job.</p><p>Cannot use more violence than is necessary to accomplish the task.</p><p>The Status of Non-human animals: Kant, Lectures on Ethics</p><p>Utilitarians think pain is bad. Why should it belong to a human?</p><p>Differentiationism</p><p>Non-human animal pain matters in the utility calculation as well.</p><p>Although, perhaps their suffering is still worth it in the ultimate utility calculation. So, this doesn‚Äôt give them strong rights, but just weaker ones.</p><p>Animal testing, for example.</p><p>Psychopaths still might get incredible enjoyment out of torturing animals, like utility-monsters, and it still might be the case that they have the right to torture animals even when others don‚Äôt.</p><p>Kant thinks humans are the only animals on the planet who are part of the ‚Äúkingdom of ends,‚Äù i.e. ends in themselves, never to be treated merely as means.</p><p>They aren‚Äôt conscious, autonomous, etc. Hence, not persons.</p><p>Only persons can be rights-bearers, since only persons can be duty-bearers.</p><p>Kant thinks animals have indirect rights (not real rights though).</p><p>Shadowy Analogues of humans</p><p>Is this a good reason to treat something like a human?</p><p>Not really doing major work, except for habituation</p><p>Being cruel to non-human animals habituates our cruelty to humans.</p><p>Is this true?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Even if it did, is that really a problem?</p><p>We might just overcome our inclinations, after all.</p><p>It‚Äôs wrong to be cruel to animals for no reason.</p><p>Animal testing, eating them for sustenance, etc. fine.</p><p>Shooting your dog because it isn‚Äôt hunting for you anymore, no good.</p><p>How do we draw this line of what counts as a good reason?</p><p>Why not direct rights?</p><p>Duty-Right correspondence</p><p>Hohfeld</p><p>‚ÄúA has a claim that B œÜ iff B has a duty to A to œÜ‚Äù</p><p>If I‚Äôm morally obligated to œÜ, does it require a target?</p><p>Does there have to be a rights-holder?</p><p>Duty to self to œÜ?</p><p>Strawson doesn‚Äôt lie to his dog. Has a self-duty not be a liar.</p><p>Be the kind of person who isn‚Äôt cruel. Molecular Duty.</p><p>So, hence, obligation to also not be cruel to animals (closer to an atomic duty, still molecular. Don‚Äôt be cruel to that particular animal seems atomic).</p><p>Not really animal rights though. They don‚Äôt have a claim right.</p><p>Can we claim on their behalf?</p><p>The Purpose of Punishment: Bentham, Principles of Morals and Legislation</p><p>Reasons for Punishment</p><p>Deterrance</p><p>Disincentivizing crime</p><p>Reform</p><p>Preventing crime through education</p><p>Understanding why something is wrong</p><p>Having the tools and resources to do something else and still make a living</p><p>Preventing Recidivism</p><p>Help wrongdoers become appropriately functioning members of society</p><p>Perhaps it is partly our fault as a society that many criminals were:</p><p>Educated incorrectly</p><p>Not given the resources and tools to live without resorting to crime</p><p>Restorative</p><p>Helping the victim recover</p><p>Restitution, paying back damages, etc.</p><p>Retribution</p><p>Revenge</p><p>Punishment today ‚ÄìPrison in particular ‚Äì This is important!</p><p>We imprison more people per capita than any other nation in the world.</p><p>We have the world‚Äôs largest prison system.</p><p>We imprison people for offenses which don‚Äôt merit imprisonment.</p><p>Our prison system is increasingly privatized ‚Äì 8% right now.</p><p>Lobbying to keep people in prison.</p><p>It‚Äôs becoming a business, not a moral function</p><p>Business of private companies</p><p>Business for the government</p><p>Taxation</p><p>Debtor‚Äôs prison</p><p>Nickel and dime fees</p><p>Prison labor as slave labor</p><p>Militarization of our police force and prison system.</p><p>Prison is more than just be confined</p><p>Violence and Rape</p><p>Educating people how to be better criminals</p><p>Reinforcing criminal culture values</p><p>Discrimination</p><p>Poor</p><p>Wealthy people don‚Äôt go to jail as often for the same crimes, and when they do, they generally get lesser sentences.</p><p>Bias ‚Äì rich people are seen more favorably</p><p>We‚Äôve evolved to see wealthy people as somehow being better people (even when it is contrary to scientific evidence)</p><p>Influence, campaign contributors, and corruption</p><p>Can afford the legal defense.</p><p>Can draw out battles for years.</p><p>Can outspend the government.</p><p>People with darker skin</p><p>Institutional racism</p><p>Bentham applies Utilitarianism to Punishment</p><p>It‚Äôs not retributive. It only seeks to maximize utility.</p><p>There may even be some crimes for which punishment isn‚Äôt worth using.</p><p>A punishment needs to maximize utility.</p><p>Punishment is pain, and pain is evil. Hence, punishment is evil.</p><p>But, it may be a necessary evil. One which is worth it on the utilitarian calculus, as it may be a better alternative than the evils caused by not having a punishment system.</p><p>Cases not to Inflict Punishment</p><p>Groundless</p><p>It better be an act of mischief.</p><p>What is mischief?</p><p>Is it just breaking the law?</p><p>What should be a utilitarian jural law?</p><p>If no longer celebrating Christmas would maximize utility, then we maybe we should outlaw it?</p><p>Inefficacious</p><p>Doesn‚Äôt affect the criminal</p><p>Infancy</p><p>Insanity</p><p>Did you choose to go off your meds?</p><p>Intoxication</p><p>Maybe you are responsible for being intoxicated though‚Ä¶</p><p>Unprofitable</p><p>Spending $40k a year for 10 years, $400,000, to imprison someone for stealing a $5,000 car.</p><p>Needless</p><p>Think of a very dangerous crime that is so risky that no one wants to do it after they realize how risky it is.</p><p>Jumping off 3-4 story buildings to tackle/assault someone. Nobody is going to do that after they realize how dangerous it is.</p><p>When worthwhile, here are 4 design principles for Punishment</p><p>Prevent all sorts of offenses</p><p>Induce criminal to commit the lesser of two or more evils, if they must do evil.</p><p>Steal money from the wealthy person, not the poor person.</p><p>Stealing Baby formula from Wal-Mart rather than let their child starve.</p><p>Make it so criminals do only the amount of evil which is necessary to complete their goal.</p><p>Don‚Äôt steal the TV alongside the baby formula from Walmart.</p><p>Prevent offenses in the first place.</p><p>Avoiding Punishment</p><p>Preventative work lowers the need for punishment</p><p>It‚Äôs cheaper to educate someone, give them resources and tools to succeed financially and be happy than it is to punish them.</p><p>Anyone who is just worried about money should be in favor of preventative welfare, not punishment.</p><p>It‚Äôs like healthcare. Free preventative healthcare and vaccines are way cheaper in the long run for an economy (and maximize utility) when compared to paying for hospital bills and hurting businesses and logistics by having sick employees or sick family members of employees</p><p>Rules</p><p>1,2 ‚Äì Scale the punishment with the crime.</p><p>The more incentive there is to commit the crime (the higher the profit), the more disincentive needs to be provided (the higher the punishment).</p><p>Love to see this applied to bankers and wall street workers.</p><p>3 ‚Äì Scale punishment to incentive the lesser of two evils</p><p>4 ‚Äì Adjust punishment to each particular offense</p><p>Only allow was is necessary.</p><p>Go light on first time, maybe heavier on second offense, and so on.</p><p>5 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt overpunish</p><p>That‚Äôs just unnecessary pain. Pain is bad.</p><p>6 ‚Äì Punish to the individual</p><p>since 3 lashings might make 10 units of pain for one person and 3 lashings might make 20 units of pain for another</p><p>and maybe pain will be a better deterrent for some than others</p><p>A $300 speeding fine for a millionaire is nothing. A $300 fine for a poor person is huge. That‚Äôs a paycheck for many folks.</p><p>7, 8 ‚Äì Punish based on risk of getting away with the crime</p><p>If you are likely to get away with it, you should be punished more severely.</p><p>Wall street is more likely to get away with it</p><p>Rich people are more likely to get away with it, etc.</p><p>Risk is part of the incentives process. Low risk is higher incentive, so you need a greater disincentive punishment.</p><p>9 ‚Äì Punish them for what they likely committed as well</p><p>If we have reason to think that being loan shark involves more than just lending people money at unreasonable rates, but also violence and murder, then punish them for the other likely entailments.</p><p>Very abuseable here.</p><p>10, 11 ‚Äì If there is a floor of the punishment, a minimal amount, don‚Äôt hesitate to give more than necessary to small crimes.</p><p>What other option would you have anyways?</p><p>12 ‚Äì Augment punishment to include accidental circumstances which render crimes unprofitable</p><p>If they were unlucky and failed to rob the bank, then they get a lesser crime.</p><p>Why?</p><p>No real pain caused in crime, so we don‚Äôt need to cause as much pain in punishment</p><p>13 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt make laws and punishments which are so complex and detailed that no one can follow them</p><p>We‚Äôre fucked. Nobody can know the thousands upon thousands of carefully crafted laws on the books. How do we even know if we are breaking the law?</p><p>Did you break the IRS tax code?</p><p>Even experts don‚Äôt know for sure.</p><p>Make useful laws</p><p>We need to be able to remit punishment.</p><p>Lashings sucks because it‚Äôs hard to take them back if you find the person is innocent.</p><p>You can give back money though.</p><p>Lashings and time in jail might be paid back a bit‚Ä¶</p><p>but can you really buy 40 years of life back for someone?</p><p>Capital punishment, the death penalty, can never be reversed.</p><p>Don‚Äôt do it, since you might be wrong.</p><p>The Relief of Global Suffering: Singer, Famine, Affluence and Morality</p><p>Utilitarian</p><p>If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything equal to or greater than what we are preventing, then we are morally required to do it.</p><p>Proximity doesn‚Äôt matter</p><p>10 feet, 10 miles, or 10,000 miles</p><p>If you can help, then you must.</p><p>Drowning child example</p><p>Self-Ownership, Libertarian view.</p><p>What it means to have a duty to the child just means they own you in that respect. They have a right to your help. They have a right to your body and effort. You lose that right in that context.</p><p>Numbers don‚Äôt matter</p><p>Every person around the drowning child has the duty to help.</p><p>Just because someone else isn‚Äôt helping the child doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have to.</p><p>Just because everyone else is doing the wrong thing doesn‚Äôt mean you are now allowed to do the wrong thing.</p><p>You aren‚Äôt excused by other people‚Äôs choices.</p><p>Individual or global utility calculation?</p><p>If everyone gives, then $5. But, if as I predict, few give, then I need to give far more. Maybe most everything I have.</p><p>We suck. We‚Äôre supposed to give.</p><p>Real poverty in the world. Real starvation. Real pain. Large amounts.</p><p>We can do something about it.</p><p>We don‚Äôt, and we‚Äôve done what is morally wrong on the utilitarian calculus.</p><p>It‚Äôs important to realize that we ought not reject Singer‚Äôs argument because we don‚Äôt like the conclusion. That‚Äôs not a good enough reason. That is literally begging the question against him.</p><p>Many people are likely to avoid utility just because they don‚Äôt like the sacrifice.</p><p>Selfishness is not a good argument though. Selfishness does not make your disagreement with Singer correct.</p></div>
