Tue 3:57 PM
 It goes ‚Äî insanely
2 hours ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 Apologies for the incredibly delayed response
1 hour ago
 I was full throttle yesterday.
1 hour ago
 it's not a problem
1 hour ago
 what were you throwing yourself into?
1 hour ago
 Two people from my team are taking the week off and it means we‚Äôre having to pick up the slack
1 hour ago
 They were careful to take care of their things so as to not leave us hanging, but one of them is responsible for the communications side of our job and I am her backup.
1 hour ago
 what is entailed in picking up the slack?
1 hour ago
 that's nice of them to leave you not hanging
1 hour ago
 So I have been giving presentations and sending emails left and right on top of everything else I‚Äôm doing.
1 hour ago
 That sounds like hell.
1 hour ago
 Picking up the slack being the two of us left get ALL the requests and emails that are normally spread out to the four of us.
1 hour ago
 The presentations were a little unnerving.
1 hour ago
 what did you present on?
1 hour ago
 I still have presenter‚Äôs anxiety.
1 hour ago
 I‚Äôm more leading than presenting truthfully. I guide our audience through discussion of any trainings we have to give and announcements directly pertaining to their work.
1 hour ago
 But I have to be the peppy ‚ÄúI have important things to say please listen‚Äù person
1 hour ago
 Your cheerleader-organizer softskills
1 hour ago
 I'd rather write emails.
1 hour ago
 
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 I mean, same.
1 hour ago
 But these calls/presentations are super helpful.
1 hour ago
 Plus trying to help juggle our ever-full social lives.
1 hour ago
 Both a blessing and a curse.
1 hour ago
 I hear that
1 hour ago
 Dunbar Number
1 hour ago
 The ever looming feeling of ‚ÄúI want to do everything and nothing all at once‚Äù
1 hour ago
 Hehehe
1 hour ago
 You said the magic words.
1 hour ago
 You sound like Hegel to me.
1 hour ago
 What about you? How fares the lifewar?
1 hour ago
 Totally read that as Bagel for some reason.
1 hour ago
 Bagels are more delicious
1 hour ago
 I'm hanging in there
1 hour ago
 working through Matt McManus' work
1 hour ago
 he writes a lot, and it's work to respond
1 hour ago
 As someone who also writes a lot?
1 hour ago
 Hehehe
1 hour ago
 I do so knowing that nobody can read everything I write; they can only hyperread, search, etc.
1 hour ago
 He's a talented political philosopher, imhol
1 hour ago
 going to see if I can become friends with him
1 hour ago
 I think I would be worth his time.
1 hour ago
 Hehehe
1 hour ago
 That‚Äôs not a perspective I think I‚Äôve ever taken with a friendship before...
1 hour ago
 actually understanding me takes a lot of work
1 hour ago
 I know people pay a serious price to rewire themselves to speak my language (even when I'm radically working to do the same for them)
1 hour ago
 my friend kickscondor has written a tool to serve the daily snapshots of my wiki (over decentralized networks): https://www.kickscondor.com/taming-outlandish-tiddlywikis
1 hour ago
 He's actually sending me into a deep think.
1 hour ago
 Sphygmus, http://sphygm.us/ has been instrumental to helping me reason about what I'm doing in my wiki. Spending a lot of time setting up my audit to remodel the wiki.
1 hour ago
 There are 6400 tiddlers, and I'm going to rewrite the whole thing.
1 hour ago
 err..re-wire*
1 hour ago
 Kids have been doing more paper oriented schoolwork. It's been book heavy for the past two weeks. This has been productive.
1 hour ago
 Handing them the best books we can find.
1 hour ago
 We're very lucky [[k0sh3k]] is the ILL librarian, seen this gives us maximum access (alongside my piracy and our extensive hyperreading of the web).
1 hour ago
 I've been throwing down from the moment I wake up until I can't lift any more with my brain.
1 hour ago
 Trying to get the kids to hit a comfortable 80% effort mode with me.
1 hour ago
 It‚Äôs always cool for me to see how hard you go with the things you care about.
1 hour ago
 YOLO =)
1 hour ago
 found this person: https://philosopher.life/#Nikita%20Voloboev:%5B%5BNikita%20Voloboev%5D%5D
1 hour ago
 I‚Äôm glad to hear the kids are blossoming and that your Others are effecting (affecting??) your so life so positively.
1 hour ago
 I continue my FTO hunt
1 hour ago
 yes, it has been a good use of my time and energy
1 hour ago
 It fills me with hope for you, if that makes any sense.
1 hour ago
 =)
1 hour ago
 If anyone ever wanted to be friends with your friends, you certainly make it easy. XD
1 hour ago
 So. Many. Links.
1 hour ago
 I research them, try to model who they are, try to empathize, demonstrate I play T42T
1 hour ago
 If I expect them to understand me, I better show them I've already put the work in to understand them. I think it justifies my initiation of pursuing meaningful relationships (and ending them).
1 hour ago
 I appreciate your showing me https://ncase.me/trust/. It reminded me that I should attempt to be more quantitative about a very large body of work I've studied in the Humanities. Few have hope in such a thing. Actually, this is one of the things I'm going to have to address in kickscondor's last note (that guy is very smart; though he wouldn't openly admit it).
1 hour ago
 It was [[K]] that showed me, so thank him. ;)
1 hour ago
 Done.
1 hour ago
 I know this grossly oversimplifies it, but I find going through the motions of that exercise every now and then to be helpful.
1 hour ago
 A good reminder of what the ‚Äúgolden rule‚Äù really could do for us when applied correctly.
1 hour ago
 preach
1 hour ago
 I hope to live by it.
1 hour ago
 Which is a very easy thing to lose given the current state of affairs.
1 hour ago
 Aye, far more convenient and selfish to play T4T in environments of perfect competition (and, it's radically worse than that). Good people gonna get got.
1 hour ago
 So what's on your social docket this week?
1 hour ago
 We had D&amp;D yesterday (which was interesting given how tired I was), don‚Äôt have any plans tonight except catching up on homework/work things, tomorrow is raid night, and Saturday we‚Äôre going to Huber‚Äôs with [[K]]‚Äôs family.
1 hour ago
 Which means we‚Äôre heading down to e-town Friday evening.
1 hour ago
 And Sunday we‚Äôre running sound which has been a very cool new thing recently
1 hour ago
 Running sound for the band I mean.
1 hour ago
 What band?
1 hour ago
 Oh, derp. The worship band at the church we go to.
1 hour ago
 Ah
1 hour ago
 I guess band is a bad word for it because it‚Äôs all volunteer based.
1 hour ago
 But it‚Äôs the best shorthand I have.
1 hour ago
 Band seems like a fine word to me.
1 hour ago
 \o/
1 hour ago
 I liked band though, and to some extent, enjoyed playing it at the church.
1 hour ago
 Soundboard as fun too.
1 hour ago
 was*
1 hour ago
 I have rediscovered my fascination with pretty dials and glowing buttons. XD
1 hour ago
 I nitpick the whole time they‚Äôre playing to craft the sound just right.
1 hour ago
 =)
1 hour ago
 I can't say I really understood it very well.
1 hour ago
 might be worth reading about too, I don't know
1 hour ago
 Little did they know I would go WAY overboard with it. XD
1 hour ago
 ha =)
1 hour ago
 I have found I am incredibly sensitive to gaps in the overall sound of a song...
1 hour ago
 If something feels off I have to make an effort to ignore it.</code></pre></div>
