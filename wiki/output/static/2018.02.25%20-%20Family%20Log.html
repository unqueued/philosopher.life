I'm glad you see it is no accident to accomplish the task. I hope you intentionally planned your day out and stick to your plan.</li><li>Last week, I had argued that we should give up on programming for a while since it seemed like you weren't really making progress. You stood up for your desire to continue programming. You argued with me that it mattered to you, and I'm glad you did. You changed my mind, and I'm glad to see it was important to you.</li><li>Even when things get rough, you are less likely to melt down. It's good to see you get a handle on your emotions.</li><li>You've done a much better job doing your chores.</li></ul></li><li>j3d1h<ul><li>Thank you for making cookies with me.</li><li>Good job setting up Discord and beginning the process of joining social networks.

Other parts of your life have suffered for it, but not much. I've got to say, you've been driven and so organized. I really appreciate that. If you didn't put in that effort of thinking ahead, planning, preparing, and organizing, I think you would feel crashing around you and so would we.
