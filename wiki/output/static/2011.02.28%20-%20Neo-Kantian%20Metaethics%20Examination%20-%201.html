<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><strong>[1][a]</strong></p><p>A mile-high definition of a contingent practical identity: ‚Äúthe basis of choice‚Ä¶a description under which you value yourself and find your life worth living and your actions to be worth undertaking.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button>  Truly, there is a lot packed into this notion, and I want to carefully unpack what I believe is most important about it. The three most cardinal features connected to this notion of a contingent practical identity are: Action, Agency, and Psychic Unity. Arguably, these features are larger than the notion of contingent practical identity itself, but I don‚Äôt think this is a problem. Contingent practical identity must be understood within the context of these cardinal features, and vice versa ‚Äì they interdefine each other. </p><p>Korsgaard gives us examples of practical identities and their acquisition:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Conceptions of practical identity include such things as roles and relationships, citizenship, memberships in ethnic or religious groups, causes, vocations, professions, and offices. It may be important to you that you are a human being, a woman or a man, a member of a certain profession, someone‚Äôs lover or friend, a citizen or an officer of the court, a feminist or an environmentalist, or whatever.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>We can immediately appreciate this notion, as it seems we all have these identities, and we all spend a great deal of our lives in these sorts of roles. Clearly, practical identity is a powerful descriptive notion for anyone attempting to understand humanity. She continues:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>One might think of a particular practical identity, if a little artificially, as a set of principles, the dos and don‚Äôts of being a teacher or a citizen, say.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>For Korsgaard, the notion of a practical identity is not merely descriptive; it is has normative characteristics. Practical identities are part of the process, for each individual, of figuring out what one ought to do in a certain role. She points out the motivational implications to possessing a practical identity:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Our conceptions of our practical identity govern our choice of actions, for to value yourself in a certain role or under a certain description is at the same time to find it worthwhile to do certain acts for the sake of certain ends, and impossible, even unthinkable, to do others.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The way in which you ‚Äòvalue‚Äô yourself in a certain description in turns serves as your motivation to act in particular ways and for certain ends which are provided, at least in large part, by a practical identity.  This leads us to Korsgaard‚Äôs contingent aspect of practical identities:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>However it goes, reasoned or arbitrary, chosen or merely the product of circumstance, the sorts of identities I am talking about remain contingent in this sense: whether you treat them as a source of reasons and obligations is up to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The various ways in which one might acquire an identity are not the sources of its contingency (even though we can say that the acquisition might be arbitrary and contingent in some cases). Rather it is the choice, which is ‚Äòup to you‚Äô, to continually keep and use these identities which make them contingent. Clearly, the contingency of practical identity is founded upon our free will. Commitment to a practical identity is thus vastly different from mere acquisition. </p><p>Once an identity is chosen (or we ‚Äòcommit‚Äô to it), it provides reasons for acting in certain ways or for pursuing certain ends.  Whether an identity is chosen (‚Äòdoctor‚Äô, for instance) or given (‚Äòson‚Äô or ‚ÄòAmerican‚Äô), it remains contingent simply because ‚Äòit is up to us‚Äô whether or not we choose to treat it as motivating, and crucially, as a guide. This contingent aspect strengthens the normative components to practical identity. She fleshes this out further:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Forms of identification are contingent, and we can walk away from them. Their hold on us depends on our own endorsement of the laws they give us. We ratify their laws whenever we act in accordance with them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If you continue to endorse the reasons the identity presents to you, and observe the obligations it imposes on you, then it‚Äôs you‚Ä¶[If not then] it‚Äôs not a form of practical identity anymore: not a description under which you value yourself. 
[Agents treat] contingent identities as the sources of absolute inviolable laws.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The obligations and reasons for action provided by contingent practical identities aren‚Äôt arbitrary and morally neutral, as one might have initially suspected about at least some of these identities. Practical identities provide strong moral normativity ‚Äì they provide moral law to their bearers.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>As Korsgaard sees it, valuing oneself in a certain role or description, committing to a practical identity, is thus committing to certain moral obligations. If she is correct, then it seems that the notion of a contingent practical identity is fundamental to the construction of our moral obligations.  This leads us to the foundational practical identity so crucial to her moral theory:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Morality itself is grounded in an essential form of practical identity, our identity as rational or human beings‚Ä¶[We as agents make a] commitment to our own human or rational identity as a form of practical identity.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Making the contingent [practical identity] necessary is one of the tasks of human life and the ability to do it is arguably a mark of a good human being.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Korsgaard believes morality exists in virtue of this fundamental practical identity. It seems the 'moral' identity, the ‚Äòrational‚Äô identity, the ‚Äòhuman‚Äô identity ‚Äì the identity of agency ‚Äì is itself a practical identity we take on. Moral agency is the foundational practical identity upon which we construct our self-constitution. Thus, our practical ‚Äòmoral‚Äô identity is the reason why our other practical identities are normatively empowered in some sense.  </p><p>Contingent practical identity is further developed in terms of the cardinal features. </p><p><strong>Action - [Cardinal Feature connected to CPI #1]</strong></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But there is a reason not to abandon all of our identities. The reason is given by‚Ä¶the human plight. We must act, and we need reasons in order to act. And unless there are some principles with which we identify we will have no reasons to act. Every human being must make himself into someone in particular, in order to have reasons to act and to live. Carving out a personal identity for which we are responsible is one the inescapable tasks of human life.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Action is strongly connected to the notion of identity. Korsgaard comes right out and claims that, ‚ÄúHuman beings are <em>condemned </em>to choice and action‚Ä¶action is necessary‚Ä¶it is our <em>plight</em>.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button>  We are destined to have a particular contingent practical identity. We are condemned to be agents, agents who choose and perform action. Importantly, Korsgaard uses the word ‚Äòaction‚Äô as a term of art; it is a technical term in her moral theory.</p><p>In her first chapter, Korsgaard endeavors to synthesize major components of Aristotelian and Kantian views on the nature of action. Out of this discussion, her definition of action follows:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The basic form of a Kantian maxim is ‚ÄúI will do act-A in order to promote end-E.‚Äù Call that entire formulation the description of action. An action, then, involves both an act and an end, an act done for the sake of an end.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">13</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>[An agent] chooses this whole package, that is, to-do-this-act-for-the-sake-of-this-end ‚Äì he chooses that, the whole package, as a thing worth doing for its own sake, and without any further end.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">14</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Vitally, ‚Äòact‚Äô and ‚Äòaction‚Äô are distinguished, while ‚Äòends‚Äô are configured into the equation. Action is a package deal; it includes both the deed and its purpose. Contingent practical identities provide motivation and guidance as to which actions we should choose to perform. Identity determines the ‚Äòact + end‚Äô combination to which are obligated. The way that action is related to the role of a ‚Äòreason‚Äô and identity isn‚Äôt completely squared up:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The reason for an action is not something outside of or behind or separate from the action at all, for explicating the action, and explicating the reason, are the same thing. Rather, an action is an essentially intelligible object that embodies a reason, the way a sentence is an essentially intelligible object that embodies a thought.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">15</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><p>Action includes and represents a reason. Contingent practical identity is the source of these reasons, and thus it is also the source of action. It isn‚Äôt just the source of motivation and guidance then; it isn‚Äôt just an identity-bearer that is performing an action; identity is, in some sense, an expression of action. </p><p>Odd questions arise, such as ‚ÄòWhat is good action?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat is bad action?‚Äô  Korsgaard explains that, ‚ÄúAction is self-constitution‚Ä¶what makes actions good or bad is how well they constitute you,‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">16</sup></button>  and ‚ÄúA bad action by contrast is something misshapen and defective.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">17</sup></button>   It seems that good action has to do with more than a single contingent identity.  </p><p><strong>Agency - [Cardinal Feature connected to CPI #2]</strong></p><p>Korsgaard‚Äôs conception of agency does a lot of her philosophical work, and it does so within the context of the notion of contingent practical identity. As I said, they interdefine each other. Exactly where one starts and the other begins isn‚Äôt so clear. It is probably safe to say that identity of agency is a special one, perhaps the least arbitrary and the most necessary. It is the one that all good humans have in common. </p><p>At least three major concepts flow from the identity of agency: choice, responsibility and necessitation. The first two are clearly connected to practical identity in these passages: </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It is as the possessor of personal or practical identity that you are the author of your actions, and responsible for them. And yet at the same time it is in choosing your actions, that you create that identity. What this means is that you constitute yourself as the author of your actions in the very act of choosing them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">18</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>We are self-conscious in a particular way: we are conscious of the grounds on which we act, and therefore are in control of them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">19</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>When you deliberately decide what sorts of effects you will bring about in the world, you are also deliberately deciding what sort of cause you will be. And that means you are deciding who you are.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">20</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>So we are each faced with the task of constructing a peculiar, individual kind of identity‚Äîpersonal or practical identity‚Ä¶It is this sort of identity that makes sense of our practice of holding people responsible, and of the kinds of personal relationship that depend on that practice.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">21</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>To regard some movement of my mind or my body as my action, I must see it as an expression of my self as a whole, rather than as a product of some force that is at work on me or in me.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">22</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>You choose and have control over, and essentially, you construct your practical identities and in doing so you choose the obligations and actions corresponding to those identities. It seems that you cannot choose one without the other. Action, obligation, and identity are rolled into one package. You are the free author of your identity, and in making these entailed commitments, you are morally responsible. </p><p>Korsgaard explains that the ‚Äútemptation to resist the claims of our practical identities is possible.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">23</sup></button>  This is interesting, and it shows that the free will component of agency is robust, and perhaps even foundational to the other identities. The ‚Äòagency identity‚Äô is interesting because it seems (although, Korsgaard will deny this, I believe) that it precedes all other identities. How do you ‚Äòdecide who you are‚Äô without having the ability to decide already? I think this suggests that free will is not sufficient (even if it is necessary) for agency in Korsgaard‚Äôs theory. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This is where the problem of personal identity comes into the picture‚Ä¶in the relevant sense there is no you prior to your choices and actions, because your identity is in a quite literal way constituted by your choices and actions.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">24</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Other issues arise - for example, how one sheds agency isn‚Äôt clear (although her conceptions of unity and disunity will attempt to explicate it). It does seem to the observer, though not to Korsgaard, that the agency identity is a necessary precondition to choosing whether or not to take on, shed, keep, and use other contingent practical identities.</p><p>This is still, however, oversimplifying the role of agency in her theory. Recall that to use one‚Äôs free will to choose an identity is to choose its obligations and its reasons and its actions, simultaneously. The (lack of a) temporal aspect of Korsgaard‚Äôs conception of agency is difficult to understand. </p><p>Fundamental to being an agent, and probably most important, is the way in which it is connected to the notion of contingent practical identity, via her conception of necessitation. Being subject to and bound by the normativity of law, experiencing the ‚Äúpsychological mechanisms of its enforcements,‚Äù is an essential feature of what it means to truly be a moral agent.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">25</sup></button>   Korsgaard (borrowing from Kant) calls this psychological force <em>necessitation</em>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">26</sup></button>   It is noteworthy that it is usually believed necessitation can only be experienced by those who can fail to follow the moral law; the assumption is that you can only be subject to and bound by normativity of law if it is a real possibility that you can fail to meet those requirements. Korsgaard will certainly agree to the idea that duties and obligations belong to agents, at least to those entities who experience necessitation.</p><p>Assuming identities are not entirely fleeting, there is a type of necessitation regarding an agent‚Äôs choice to follow a particular identity's obligations. Agents may have incentives, desires, or emotions which in some way drive them to not follow the obligations of an identity. They might, in this sense, maintain an identity and contradict its obligations and choose otherwise (I won‚Äôt exactly call this ‚Äòaction‚Äô as she understands the word). This sort of necessitation has a small scope; the larger scope is even more important. </p><p>There seems to be necessitation between different identities as well.  That is, the obligations of one identity may conflict with the obligations of another.  This larger notion of necessitation of agency is vital to the contingent practical identity framework in that it calls forth her most cardinal feature, psychic unity. As she says, ‚ÄúI also believe it is essential to the concept of agency that an agent be unified.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">27</sup></button>  This struggle for unity, at least in part, is based upon conflicts among our various contingent practical identities. She says:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Normative standards ‚Äì as I am about to argue ‚Äì are the principles by which we achieve the psychic unity that makes agency possible. The work of achieving psychic unity, the work that we experience as necessitation, is what I am going to call self-constitution.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">28</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><p><strong>Psychic Unity - [Cardinal Feature connected to CPI #3]</strong></p><p>Psychic unity is our ultimate goal. Korsgaard explains:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Identities are the sources of our reasons, but of course the idea is not just that we decide which ones we want and conform to them. We have many particular practical identities and so we also face the task of uniting them into a coherent whole.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">29</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>There is work and effort ‚Äì a kind of struggle ‚Äì involved in the moral life, and those who struggle successfully are the ones whom we call ‚Äúrational‚Äù or ‚Äúgood.‚Äù But it is not the struggle <em>to be rational or to be good</em>. It is, instead, the ongoing struggle for integrity, the struggle for psychic unity, the struggle to be, in the face of psychic complexity, a single unified agent.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">30</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Agency is about having a unified super-identity, a sum unity of contingent practical identities (which it is itself also therefore a contingent practical identity). Practical identities can conflict, and an agent must unify them. Of course, this again brings up the paradox she mentions, and I‚Äôm not sure how she can solve it. If she is able to solve the paradox, and she is right about our final end as unification, then we see that practical identities become even more complex, particularly as they are subject to degrees. She alludes to this:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>People are more or less successful at constituting their identities as unified agents, and a good action is one that does this well. But since action requires agency, it follows that an action that is less successful at constituting its agent is to that extent less of an action. So on this conception, ‚Äúaction‚Äù is an idea that admits of degrees. An action chosen in a way that more successfully unifies and integrates its agent is more authentically, more fully, an action, than one that does not.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">31</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Action, identity, agency, and unity admit of degree. You aren‚Äôt necessarily 100% a teacher or 100% a father ‚Äì it is possible that you are only 60% of this identity. The unification of your contingent practical identities is about making your super-identity 100% an identity. This helps us understand the forces of normativity within her theory:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Being a person, having a personal identity, being a rational agent, is in itself a form of work. And the experience of necessitation, with its elements of effort and even of pain, is the experience of the form of work. A good person, it follows, is one who is good at this work. A good person is someone who is good at being a person.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">32</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>To be a good person, to be a good agent, to be a good human, to have a good identity is to be unified. It is complicated to commit to being a self.</p><p><strong>[b]</strong></p><p>The cardinal feature of agency has some serious problems, almost all of them connected to the paradox of self-constitution. There is more attached to this paradox than she lets on (although she is probably aware of it). I see three problems arising in this paradox. </p><p>First, the temporal problem is the most obvious. What does it mean to choose an identity if you don‚Äôt already have at least the agency identity? It seems that such a choice isn‚Äôt the choice of an agent. It seems that in taking on any non-agency practical identity will somehow lack moral force if it wasn‚Äôt the choice of an entity which was an agent beforehand. How can we make sense of amoral entities choosing to become moral agents? It isn‚Äôt clear.</p><p>(Further, one might imagine that agency is the sort of identity that comes to you without choice, and perhaps you can lose your agency via suicide or something akin to massive head trauma. But, outside of suicide, it doesn‚Äôt make much sense to say you can choose to shed your agency. What would that look like? Surely, she needs a powerful account of this.)</p><p>This paradox of choosing your identity and choosing to be an agent brings with it a second problem as well, namely the idea that there are degrees of agency which you choose. Along with it come degrees of action, identity, unity, moral responsibility, and morality. It isn‚Äôt clear what a degree of some of these things will entail or how it operates. </p><p>Action, for example, seems modular, not like a gradient. What exactly is bad action? It seems that an action can be so bad, springing from such a great degree of disunity of identity, that it is no longer action. Further, it seems that moral responsibility only exists when there is action for which an agent is an author. Was Hitler even a moral agent at all - were his acts really ‚Äòbad‚Äô at all? Was Hitler morally responsible for what he did? It seems he isn‚Äôt an agent, and he isn‚Äôt morally responsible, and his acts weren‚Äôt really morally wrong given Korsgaard‚Äôs account. Even if he was minimally an agent, and he minimally had actions, and he was minimally responsible, and minimally ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, it seems that he isn‚Äôt as responsible as the virtuous agent. In this case, Hitler‚Äôs actions don‚Äôt count as being as action-like as the virtuous agent, and they don‚Äôt count as admittedly of moral wrong in the same way that the virtuous agent‚Äôs actions are morally right. </p><p>It seems difficult to give examples of immoral agents in her theory. Wouldn‚Äôt we want to say that immoral agents are just as responsible for their actions as even the most virtuous of agents? Intuitively, it makes sense to  say that immoral agents are unified, and that there isn‚Äôt conflict among their various practical identities, but rather what their practical identities are all about are in themselves morally wrong. But, that is not the picture which Korsgaard paints, and that brings us to the last problem.</p><p>Korsgaard‚Äôs conception of agency with respect to contingent practical identities suffers from the problem of moral construction. Korsgaard is offering an account of how one ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô morality. What counts as moral law, and whatever obligations we have, is ‚Äòup to us‚Äô. Korsgaard has imparted too much power to agency, in this case. If an agent gets to choose identities, obligations, and what counts as ‚Äòvaluable‚Äô, and as long as the agent is perfectly unified, then it seems whatever they do is arbitrary, but also automatically morally good. Her conception of agency enables practical identity to justify behavior in a circular, subjective fashion.</p><p><strong>[c]</strong></p><p>Korsgaard really doesn‚Äôt think this is paradoxical. As I said before, I think part of her argument will rest upon the notion that possessing all necessary capacities for being an agent is not sufficient for agency. Perhaps free will and rationality, while necessary, aren‚Äôt sufficient for agency. If this is true, then it seems that one can freely choose to commit to the agency identity. In one way, I like this argument - moral responsibility is something you grow into.  But, this should not be confused with the idea that you can choose agency.</p><p>I‚Äôm not sure how she would reply to the idea that a free non-agent choosing to be a free agent has moral force to it. I suspect that her constructivism would allow her to make this move. If so, you can shed agency, but retain your free will and other agency-necessary capacities.</p><p>The degrees problem which flows from the premises of the paradox is also largely solved by her constructivism, if she wished to go that route. Without an independent, objective morality, it would seem an acceptable move to claim that ‚Äòmorality‚Äô looks like this inside the mind and leave it at that.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know how she would defend her constructivism other than to explain that this is the way the world is. Perhaps she might say, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just what it means to be a moral agent, etc.‚Äù She certainly doesn‚Äôt agree to the idea that we can shed and take up identities whimsically, which is agreeable. Korsgaard thinks her 'dedications and integrity' clause is what prevents me from 'giving up my fatherhood' as an identity at whim. However, I‚Äôm still not sure how it is not 'up to me' in some sense whether or not I can take up or drop off my practical identities. I hope she has a deeper account of this issue.
	</p><p><strong>[2][a]</strong></p><p><strong>[Argument #1]</strong></p><p>Korsgaard is a constructivist with strong elements of moral anti-realism in her theory; essentially, she denies that there are moral properties independent of the mind. The dogmatic rationalist holds that moral propositions are objective features of the world, existing independent of our minds. Given her position, her attack on the moral realism of the dogmatic rationalist makes a lot of sense (although, it is possible that it is her argument against moral realism that led her to her current position).</p><p>She explains that she is against the provision of ‚Äúsome sort of ontological foundation, [which posits]‚Ä¶the existence of certain normative facts or entities to which moral requirements somehow refer.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">33</sup></button>  Korsgaard doesn‚Äôt like the metaphysical commitments which the dogmatic rationalists make ‚Äì but why? She explains:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The rationalist account‚Ä¶allows instrumental reasons to function as guides, but at the price of making it impossible for us to see any special reason why we should be motivated to follow these guides.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">34</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Korsgaard believes that the rationalist‚Äôs conception of instrumental reason, one of the three sorts of practical reason initially discussed, is assumed to be a principle which is an independent, objective feature of the world. Crucially, she claims that while this may be sufficiently guiding, it is insufficiently motivating. </p><p>Essentially, Korsgaard doesn‚Äôt think that an objective moral fact sitting out there in metaphysical reality is really going to be motivating to an agent, and thus, regardless of its guiding contents, it can‚Äôt serve or function as a type of practical reason.</p><p>She is calling out the dogmatic rationalist‚Äôs framework and asking ‚Äòwhy‚Äô an agent should really care about morality. Because she believes the dogmatic rationalist can‚Äôt demonstrate motivation, their moral realism is an illusion. This is cardinal to her overall moral theory because, if she is right in criticizing the moral realist commitments of the dogmatic rationalist, and this independent objectivity is an illusion, then her constructivist theory is plausible. </p><p><strong>[Argument #2]</strong></p><p>Korsgaard argues that the dogmatic rationalist is unable to provide a substantial, meaningful, and non-circular definition of rationality. She says:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The dogmatic rationalist‚Äôs strategy is to first identify reasons‚Äîby asserting them to be parts of realty‚Äîand then to define rationality in terms of reasons: a rational being is by definition one who responds to reasons in the right way. This strategy necessarily leads to a purely definitional account of rationality, and can tell us nothing substantive about what function or power of the human mind rationality is.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">35</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The relationship between reasons and rationality is misconstrued, as Korsgaard‚Äôs sees it. She draws a distinction between Rationality and Reasons. She says that dogmatic rationalists begin with reasons, and then 'go up' to rationality. She thinks we have to go from top down instead to avoid problems. In part, she‚Äôs pointing out something fishy about the dogmatic rationalist‚Äôs strategy to interdefine reasons, rationality, and the rational being. It seems tautological and analytic, but also circular and uninformative about the contents and nature of these concepts. </p><p>This is somewhat similar to the criticism of moral reasoning in virtue ethics as being circular; namely, the virtuous agent defines virtue, and virtue defines the virtuous agent - but in the end, we aren‚Äôt exactly sure what either one really looks like.</p><p>Korsgaard offers a possible rebuttal which a dogmatic rationalist might give:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>There is one way in which the realist strategy still might seem to work. We could simply <em>define </em>a rational agent as one who responds in the appropriate way to reasons, whatever they are, and we could then give realist accounts of all practical reasons, including instrumental ones. There is a set of normative facts, about which reasons there are, and a rational agent is by definition someone whose actions are motivated by these reasons.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">36</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps the dogmatic rationalist can say that insofar as agents are not motivated by independent, objective moral truth, they aren‚Äôt rational. This is an interesting approach, but I think Korsgaard still has the circularity problem. She explains:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If all we mean is that the person is reliably caused to act in accordance with reasons, we fail to capture what is rational about the person. His actions may be rationally appropriate, but not because he sees that they are so: it seems to be a sort of accident that his motivational wiring follows the pathways of reason.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">37</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The problem with the circular definition is that it seems accidental rather than essential. If a dogmatic rationalist would use this argument, then it isn‚Äôt just cheating on the definition, but really it fails to capture meaningful motivational requirements, in Korsgaard‚Äôs eyes.</p><p>This criticism of dogmatic rationalism points toward a cardinal concern for Korsgaard, namely offering an account that can actually describe the contents of rationality and reasons, and essentially, she wants a non-circular account of the normative force of practical reason. If she herself can avoid making a circular argument, and she can offer a substantive account of rationality, reason, and the normative force of practical reason, then it seems she would have the more plausible theory.</p><p><strong>[b]</strong></p><p><strong>[Counter-argument #1]</strong></p><p>It is unclear what it means for something to be true if it doesn‚Äôt have the independent, objective status. Just because X in your mind just doesn‚Äôt seem like a good enough reason to call X a truth. Yes, it is true that ‚ÄòX is in your mind‚Äô, but that doesn‚Äôt make it true that ‚ÄòX‚Äô. This motivational concern seems like misdirection. How can Korsgaard escape from this strong moral realist view without becoming a nihilist or relativist? I don‚Äôt know. </p><p>Consider, as an example, a comparison between mathematics and the categorical imperative. Let us assume (and I think Korsgaard does) both the categorical imperative and mathematics are <em>synthetic a priori</em> truths. Would Korsgaard agree to the idea that the principles and truths of mathematics are not dependent upon our minds? It seems like the truths of mathematics are not ones we socially construct, but rather discover. Surely the truth of mathematics is best handled by metaphysical commitments of the dogmatic rationalist, despite the uneasiness we might have making such strong, yet abstract and difficult to empirically point out, ontological assumptions. Are we motivated to believe and use a truth like 2+2=4? I think so. And, why?  Because it is true. I don‚Äôt think it is coincidental that I‚Äôm motivated to believe it. I think there is something wrong with being motivated to believe and use something when it isn‚Äôt objectively true. </p><p>Consider Goldbach‚Äôs conjecture (every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes). It is either true or false, but we don‚Äôt know which. We have good reasons to believe it is likely true, but we have no proof solution. We don‚Äôt yet know. Surely the truth or falsity of this mathematical claim does not rest upon my belief. The dogmatic rationalist is a great position to tell the story of what is happening here, and I think Korsgaard wants to agree to dogmatic rationalist story in this case. But, why can‚Äôt the same sort of objectivity story be told for moral truths?  It seems that the truth of mathematics binds us in the same way that truth of rational morality binds us.</p><p>I‚Äôm left wondering how respect for the moral law not itself the sort of ‚Äòspecial reason why we should be motivated‚Äô to follow the moral law as a guide? Why can‚Äôt the dogmatic rationalist posit this ‚Äòrespect for the moral law‚Äô? I don‚Äôt know.</p><p>The potency of morality and the relationship between epistemology and ontology are both at stake. It would have been prudent if Korsgaard had instead openly started with and assumed the dogmatic rationalist‚Äôs position, the position which we all would hope to pan out, only giving it up after demonstrating beyond a shadow of doubt that the position is committed to something illogical and intolerable (which she hasn‚Äôt done). There is too much at stake to do otherwise.</p><p><strong>[Counter-argument #2]</strong></p><p>I don‚Äôt find the circularity of such a foundational topic to be terribly objectionable. We are the bottom level of philosophy, and it is here that our justifications begin to look a lot more like assumptions than proofs. At some level, we are going to beg the question, and formally include our axioms within the justification of our axioms. There is no way to justify the reflexivity principle, loosely speaking, A= A, unless one already assumed it is true, and likewise for other axiomatic propositions like the law of excluded middle. It seems these sorts of meta-ethical questions, which are at the foundational link between epistemology and ontology, are not the sort of concepts which have anything beneath them with which justify an argument. It is because of this, at least for now, I don‚Äôt see a problem with a circular definition of these concepts.</p><p>As such, I‚Äôll make the odd move and claim that Korsgaard‚Äôs criticism against circularity, in this case, will ‚Äòhold-water‚Äô if and only if she is able to present a theory which isn‚Äôt also subject to the same criticism. I‚Äôm not sure how she isn‚Äôt making, however, the similar sort of circular definition in her own theory.</p><p>Korsgaard has an innately constructivist view of these concepts. In her theory, it seems that rational morality is what we define it to be. It seems she also employs a circular definition, not from mind to independent reality, but from the mind to itself. Even if the dogmatic rationalist doesn‚Äôt have a substantive or informative definition of rational morality, I don‚Äôt think Korsgaard does either. </p><p><strong>[3][a]</strong></p><p><strong>[Aspect #1]</strong></p><p>Like the dogmatic rationalist, Korsgaard locates rationality internally, but rather than finding practical reasons to act externally, she also finds them internally. The internality of both rationality and reasons is a major aspect of her theory. The practical reason to act is created through the categorical imperative and the instrumental principle, which are both internal to the agent (in her opinion; she also comes to define them as the same thing, eventually). This internality demonstrates a strong relationship between rationality and the will. This is part of meeting the requirements of practical reason: being both guiding and motivating. She explains:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Kant is usually thought of as a rationalist, but the Kantian conception of practical rationality represents a third and distinct alternative. According to the Kantian conception, to be rational just is to be autonomous. That is: to be governed by reason, and to govern yourself, are one and the same thing.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">38</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>By seeing what goes with [Kant‚Äôs] early presentation of the instrumental principle, we are led to the mature Kantian view, which traces both instrumental reason and moral reason to a common normative source: the autonomy or self-government of the rational agent.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">39</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><p>Korsgaard holds this conception of rational autonomy. Rationality and will are entwined. An agent can‚Äôt be said to have one without the other.   Rationality and the autonomous will are, in fact, the same thing ‚Äì the same faculty by which one determines what actions to take in order to reach the end one has chosen. She continues:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The principles of practical reason are constitutive of autonomous action: they do not represent external restrictions on our actions, whose power to motivate us is therefore inexplicable, but instead describe the procedures involved in the autonomous willing. But they also function as normative or guiding principles because in following these procedures we are guiding ourselves.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">40</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><p>Rationality acts both as motivation and guidance because it is descriptive of the movements of the autonomous will. In this way, Korsgaard escapes the trap of having the instrumental principle merely describe what happens when one desires something.  It is truly the will ‚Äì the faculty of choice ‚Äì that drives decision making. She continues:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Kant‚Äôs version of the instrumental principle [is] formulated in terms of the will, not in terms of desire. In general or schematic form, the instrumental principle tells us that if we will an end, then we ought to will the means to that end.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">41</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Instead, the act of making a maxim‚Äîthe basic act of will‚Äîconforms to the instrumental principle by its very nature‚Ä¶To will an end just is to will to cause or realize the end, hence to will to take the means to the end. This is the sense in which the principle is analytic. The instrumental principle is constitutive of an act of the will. If you do not follow it, you are not willing the end at all.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">42</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>By combining rationality and reason through the autonomous will, Korsgaard makes it possible to view the process as both constructivist and normative.  This is connected to the practical identity, as well ‚Äì in choosing an end and committing yourself to a particular identity and its obligations, you create and accept normative moral laws:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Willing an end just is committing yourself to realizing the end. Willing an end, in other words, is an essentially first-personal and normative act. To will an end is to give oneself a law, hence, to govern oneself. That law is not the instrumental principle; it is some law of the form: realize this end. That of course is equivalent to ‚ÄúTake the means to this end.‚Äù So willing an end is equivalent to committing yourself, first personally, to taking the means to that end.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">43</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Korsgaard‚Äôs conception of the relationship between practical reason and rationality is necessary for the rest of her moral theory. The internalist argument she provides is of cardinal importance to the concepts of self-constitution ‚Äì they are inextricably linked. The notion that rationality finds internally the reason to will and act allows her to support a constructivist view of morality. </p><p>[Aspect #2]</p><p>The instrumental principle is normative only insofar as the categorical imperative normatively gives us ends. The instrumental principle is not normative on its own - it doesn‚Äôt stand alone. While the categorical imperative doesn‚Äôt specifically tell us which certain ends we have, the categorical imperative leads us to some ends, and in doing so, it grants normativity to the instrumental principle.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">44</sup></button>   We see that Korsgaard is, at first, considering that the instrumental principle is in some way separate from, but not fully independent of, the categorical imperative. She points towards this:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The instrumental principle cannot stand alone. Unless there are normative principles directing us to the adoption of certain ends, there can be no requirement to take the means to our ends. The familiar view that the instrumental principle is the only requirement of practical reason is incoherent.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">45</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The instrumental reason is dependent upon the categorical imperative. So far it seems that she is still willing to separate instrumental reason, in some sense, from the categorical imperative, but her later clarification demonstrates that it really isn‚Äôt separable. There is a unification theory of practical reason. As she changes the outline of her argument in her afterword, we see an explanation which ends up saying something profound, namely, there is only one type of practical reason, the categorical imperative. Admittedly, she originally points towards this in a footnote:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Moral or unconditional principles and the instrumental principle are both expressions of the basic requirement of 
giving oneself a law, and bring out different implications of that requirement‚Ä¶I am inclined to think that the right thing to say about this parallels what I take to be the right thing to say about Aristotle‚Äôs theory of the unity of the virtues. There is really only one virtue, but there are many different vices, different ways to fall away from virtue, and when we assign someone a particular virtue, what we really mean is that she does not have the corresponding vice. In a similar way, there is only one principle of practical reason, the categorical imperative viewed as the law of autonomy, but there are different ways to fall away from autonomy, and the different principles of practical reason really instruct us not to fall away from our autonomy in these different ways.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">46</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Korsgaard makes an important analogous explanation of the single principal of practical reason in this footnote; it is from this after thought that her change in the afterward develops.  She compares her idea to Aristotle‚Äôs conception of the single virtue.  According to Aristotle, there is only one virtue; there are, however, many vices (that is, many ways to fail to meet that virtue).  What we conceive of as many virtues, as being in some way artificially separable from the single virtue, are really various ways we can fail to fail (i.e. succeed) ‚Äì they are not, in essence, separate entities from the single virtue.  Likewise, in Korsgaard‚Äôs view of the single principal of practical reason, the only true principal is the categorical imperative.  There are many ways, however, that one can fail to achieve or perhaps lose autonomy ‚Äì and the various corresponding ways to fail to fail can be seen as principals of practical reason.  The instrumental principle, then, is not separate from the categorical imperative ‚Äì it is merely part of the way to meet the requirements of the categorical imperative. Failure to implement the instrumental principle is but one specific way of failing to meet the categorical imperative.</p><p>She later makes the explicit claim in her afterword:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The instrumental principle is not a principle of practical reason that is separable from the categorical imperative: rather, it picks out an aspect of the categorical imperative; the fact that the laws of our will must be practical laws, laws that constitute us as agents by rendering us efficacious‚Ä¶.So let me here state the conclusion of my argument properly. There is only one principle of practical reason, and it is the categorical imperative.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">47</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>By integrating the instrumental principle into the categorical imperative, she is able to explain why the instrumental principle has normative force.</p><p><strong>[b]</strong></p><p><strong>[Counter-argument #1]</strong></p><p>Her theory does show guidance and motivation, but I think her argument does so at the cost of normative force rather than to the conclusion of it. Two issues come to mind. </p><p>The first is that her internalism removes the objectivity that I seek above all else. Without it, I just don‚Äôt see anything as justified. Of course, I‚Äôm defining justification as something that is outside me, and it doesn‚Äôt look like Korsgaard is willing to go that direction.</p><p>Second, I question if it is an appropriate move to combine rationality and the will as she does. I certainly recognize that there is a strong connection between the two, but I‚Äôm not convinced that they are the same faculty. I don‚Äôt know what it means to do what is irrational or wrong in her theory. Separation of will from rationality provides room to make better sense of things like irrationality and even immorality. I don‚Äôt see why one can‚Äôt choose to will what is irrational. </p><p><strong>[Counter-argument #2]</strong></p><p>I‚Äôm not sure I can disagree with the idea that there is only one principle of practical reason. I think, however, that it‚Äôs a possibility with which moral realism might be able to agree. But, therein lays the difference. The relationship between the agent and the principle is where I disagree with Korsgaard the most. </p><p>The relationship between the instrumental principle and categorical imperative should be a strong one. Exactly how strong, I‚Äôm not sure. </p><p>Admittedly, in conjunction with others features of a moral theory, there are odd sorts of positions which might come about if we collapse the instrumental principle into the categorical imperative. Let us assume that only universalizable maxims count as rational ones. Aren‚Äôt there elements of rationality in non-universalizable maxims, specifically of the sort which include a proper implementation of the instrumental principle?</p><p>If the instrumental principle is merely an integrated subset of the categorical imperative, then it seems extraordinarily difficult to talk about being rational, to any degree, in reference to a non-universalizable maxim. I believe some evil people are ‚Äòmore rational‚Äô in their approach to being evil than others. Would not the agent who is most effective at bringing about evil ends be, in some way, more immoral than the inept agent who failed to implement the instrumental principle? I‚Äôm not convinced this sort of story can be told within Korsgaard‚Äôs framework. </p><p>There definitely has to be overlap between the instrumental principle and the categorical imperative. I don‚Äôt see how it is plausible that the categorical imperative includes within it the instrumental principle. It doesn‚Äôt seem to make enough room for doing what is wrong, what is against the categorical imperative, while still being otherwise quite rational.
