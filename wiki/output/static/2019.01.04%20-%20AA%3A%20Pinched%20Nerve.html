JAN 4 1:36 PM
Ah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I've been feeling the need for sleep too. Blood pressure has been higher than normal (my chillun are literally killing me ;P). Friday's fine so far. It's been productive. Feeling completely swamped by my wiki. There are 10,000 things to do.
JAN 4 1:37 PM
Oh my that is a bunch!
JAN 4 1:38 PM
Our smallest dog is healing from a pinched nerve ([[AG]] squashed him) or something close. Jer opted not to get xrays but meds for him. He likes to wake up yelling during the night (the dog not Jer) hehe :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
JAN 4 1:40 PM
And I am trying to help out a   Friend who is newly married but is having issues.
JAN 4 1:42 PM
Ah. I have no idea how the xrays would help either (surgery?).
JAN 4 1:42 PM
Oh, that sucks. How are you hoping to help them?
JAN 4 1:42 PM
No idea ‚Äîthere is nothing broken and he is eating ok so they gave him steroids and muscle relaxers
JAN 4 1:44 PM
Makes sense.
JAN 4 1:44 PM
I can see why sleeping isn't so easy, lol.
JAN 4 1:45 PM
Well ‚ÄîI knew him before her (They both worked at the bookstore before dating and getting married)
JAN 4 1:45 PM
She has anxiety issues so she has spent nights at our house before they were married.
JAN 4 1:47 PM
She texted me at midnight ish on Wednesday saying that they had been arguing a bunch lately and he has gotten violent. The neighbors called the police and he was arrested...
JAN 4 1:48 PM
Wow.
JAN 4 1:48 PM
Yeah not what I expected
JAN 4 1:49 PM
That sucks. What is she going to do?
JAN 4 1:49 PM
Is it over?
JAN 4 1:50 PM
She and their dog stayed with us last night. She is headed to her brother‚Äôs house for the weekend. Court is Monday. He is out right now but cannot contact her until Monday (after court)
JAN 4 1:53 PM
I am glad she was able to stay with you. This is a time of crisis for her.
JAN 4 1:55 PM
Given your predictions, what do you hope will occur?
JAN 4 1:56 PM
After talking about some of the episodes, it seems that they are more emotional and verbal abuse than violent which is still painful.
JAN 4 2:12 PM
He just started anger management counseling but has only been twice.
JAN 4 2:12 PM
He is very good with words but doesn‚Äôt have much social sense
JAN 4 2:15 PM
I hope he wants to get help and change but that will depend on his willingness and effort. First year of marriage is tough
JAN 4 2:19 PM
Angry people are very hard to change and very unpleasant to live with ‚ÄîI think we both know that
JAN 4 2:23 PM
Ideas?
JAN 4 2:24 PM
I do not know these people as well as you. I am not yet convinced the marriage should continue. Even from a biblical perspective, he has already severed it. I think she needs space from him, and she needs to think. Ground rules and enforcement are necessary. She needs an escape hatch.
JAN 4 2:55 PM
Sorry I am slow to answer.  Will be on and off while at work.
JAN 4 2:57 PM
I will be thinking.
JAN 4 2:57 PM
No problem‚ÄîI had kid questions too :blush:
JAN 4 2:57 PM
And thank you for thinking
JAN 4 2:58 PM
Shoot away.
JAN 4 2:58 PM
I would not want [[L]] or [[AG]] to stay in a relationship that was that unhappy and painful (She is just a few years older than [[L]]) I also would want my son (if I had one) to get help because this certainly would end any relationship he started
JAN 4 3:15 PM
That is an excellent argument.
