<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was not productive at all. We had tons of students streaming in, and our teacher had us oscillate between our actual work in the classroom and looking like we were doing something in the shop. We can't do anything in the shop with kids in there. It's all grinding and welding, which they can't be there for. Hence, it was a waste of time. We also didn't do much at all in the classroom. We studied for an exam. I was ready (or as ready as I was going to be) for the test by 11:00. I basically was forced to wait until 2:00 to take the exam. I did very poorly, 82. My teacher saw my face and told me not to worry about it. He said it was just pride, and went back to his old story about being in college, where someone was happy to get a C. The problems I missed on the exam were very poorly worded, failing to match the books vocabulary and main points on these sections. Only two of us even passed, Chris and I. </p><p>We did a bit of work on the simulator. We put the flanges on, but that's about it.</p><p>I did get to socialize with the guys some. It went better today. </p><p>I asked Luke if he would come help on Friday. He said he would. I need to ask the teacher for the time off or the ability to leave early. I also need to make sure we can borrow the dolly. Furthermore, I need to find a way to dump our old stuff. Luke has a truck. This will be useful to us. </p></div>
