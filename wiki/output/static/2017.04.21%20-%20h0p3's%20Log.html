<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">How is your health? Daily routine? </h2><p>It's okay. I'm still feeling depressed, but it wasn't as bad as it was. I will continue to take DCK once a week. I need to. I found a mixer that makes it go down easier. My body obviously does not want it. It requires wrestling.</p><h2 class="">What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?</h2><p>I'm in my scheduled 2-week cannabis abstinence period. It is going better than I expected. I'm considering just stopping for now. I'd probably only get to use for 2-4 more weeks anyway.</p><h2 class="">Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technologic, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. </h2><p>Essentially, I want the full 60-days (could technically get away with 20-days, but I absolutely cannot afford to fail) before August to flush it out of my system to pass all possible drug tests. Technically, that means I should stop on June 1st. My gut feeling about stopping early is this: I believe I will run out of course material long before June 1st. I have buttwelds and bookwork left, which I believe I can master in less than a month. </p><p>I will likely be conscripted to teach and try to weld if I have the chance. It seems like the higher utility option is to co-op and continue coming in to pass NCCER tests. I can't co-op without passing drugs tests. Thus, by the time I'm finishing up the pipefitting course in the next month or so, I'd like to be able to walk straight into a co-op. </p><p>We could use the money. I could use the experience, networking, etc (which again, is for the money). </p><p>I'm also worried that I'm filling I'm pushing the pleasure-button in my brain with games. This may or may not be a good coping mechanism. I will need to watch myself. </p><h2 class="">What are you going to do about what happened?</h2><p>I'm not sure yet. We'll see how DCK goes. Its half-life is incredibly short compared to cannabutter, going to baseline within 1-2 weeks (it's also not tested for). It seems like the best option. I have to make sure I'm not drinking heavily though. It should be abstained from as much as possible. This ensures that when I need it, I can use it. It sucks that alcohol is the legal drug here; it's obviously the most dangerous one. =( That's okay. I will make do with what I have. Let us not forget there are other options in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="The%2520Ark.html">The Ark</a>, but I need to see about their drug-testing.</p></div>
