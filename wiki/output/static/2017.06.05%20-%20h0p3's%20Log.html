<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">How is your health? Daily routine? </h2><p>It's good. I'm probably not getting enough sleep. But, I've been keeping a schedule well enough. I've noticed I've been sleeping in on Saturdays more than usual. I will continue to monitor it.</p><p>I've been more eating quite a bit. I'm not holding myself accountable to it yet since I have plenty of fish to fry. I should consider it though. I've been keeping that log for a while.</p><hr><h2 class="">What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?</h2><p>My good friends ALM and JOP (married) and their two children are coming to visit. I'm excited. I hope it goes well. We've not seen each other since they left our house in New Orleans.</p><hr><h2 class="">Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. </h2><p>They were struggling and made significant sacrifices for them to live with us. It was an interesting time, and I was glad they came. I was sad to see them leave, especially since it wasn't under the best circumstances. We've kept in touch. They've rebuilt their lives it seems, and I'm very happy for them.</p><p>I'm feeling anxious and odd about it because I don't want it to be weird for us. That's all. I think my friend maybe doesn't want to see me (or he was worried that I didn't want to see him). I'm glad they are coming though.</p><hr><h2 class="">What are you going to do about what happened?</h2><p>Hopefully, have a good time with my friends. =)</p></div>
