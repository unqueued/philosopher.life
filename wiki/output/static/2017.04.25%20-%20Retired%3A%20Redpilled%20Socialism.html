</p></blockquote><h2 class="">Intro:</h2><p>Traditionally, the strength of socialist thought has been its <em>descriptive</em> critique of capitalism.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> Effective socialism must also <em>prescriptively</em> offer us a practical methodology for escaping, healing, and preventing the ravages of capitalism in its various stages and unique cycles (I'm fine calling the most ideal prescriptive state of affairs: Communism). This is a post-modern critique we must take seriously, but we must also offer metamodern solutions. Here I briefly tackle both conventional socialist descriptions of capitalism and consider prescriptions regarding our current global late stage capitalism crisis.</p><p>Trigger warning: it is likely the case that something I say in this article will piss you off. For those who have been strongly conditioned to mindlessly reject Marxist points of view, the beginning half will not be to your liking. For those lucky few who aren't immediately allergic to socialism, I will also likely piss you off by offering my redpilled strain of socialism, a dark brand which even Leftists (already a splintered minority given the current Overton window) generally will not even consider for religious reasons (lacking the cynicism necessary for uncovering epistemically justified idealism). Unfortunately, you will also be disappointed by the fact that I don't seem to have a happy answer, even though I try to find hope.</p><h2 class="">Primer on the Conventional Socialist Critique of Capitalism:</h2><p>Labor adds value to materials. We generate value by embedding our labor (time, energy, effort, etc.) into products; part of who we are is imbued in the things we labor to create. The total value a worker creates through their labor is <em>productivity value</em>. Who owns this labor and the resulting productivity value, to what extent, and why? </p><p>For the capitalist, productivity value is split into two: wage value and surplus value.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> A product's <em>wage value</em> is used to pay the worker. The value generated beyond the wages paid to the worker is <em>surplus value</em>. It is eventually the source of profit.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> Surplus value is used to pay <em>constant capital</em><button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> costs, including replacing the means of production and paying for marketing, R&amp;D, new technology, distribution, finances, human resources, logistics, expansion, security, intelligence, industrial espionage, competitive advantages, political influence, taxes, etc. The remaining surplus is profit.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button></p><p>Capitalists hire workers to create products, which are sold for approximately the productivity value. Insofar as there is a difference between wage value and productivity value (i.e. the surplus value), a worker is alienated from their labor (and perhaps themselves, insofar as they imbue their identities into the products of their labor). The capitalist pays legally required wage value to workers, pays economically required constant capital costs, and keeps the rest as profit. Thus, the capitalist exploits workers by extracting excessive surplus value from the productivity value of the workers' labor.</p><p>Profits may be used to pay for the capitalist's survival and lifestyle: purchasing goods, services, and <em>personal property</em>. Capitalists with abundant profit may have all their personal desire satisfied, and thus reinvest the profit to acquire <em>private property</em>. Excess profit is used to cyclically generate more capital by expanding the labor exploitation process. Capital begets capital.</p><p>At first glance, this may not seem problematic (especially to those psychologically conditioned to accept it). Unfortunately, the repeated application of this business cycle results in dangerous shifts in the power dynamics of a society and the increasing exploitation of the working class. The result is the exponential centralization of capital in the hands of capitalists, which is thought to result in the <em>Crisis of Capitalism</em>.</p><p>Crucially, capitalism is not stable. The first source of instability arises in markets saturated with competitors who must continually lower their profit margins in order to underbid their competition. Those who cannot compete must exit the market. Those who stay will consume each others' customers and cannibalize each other through mergers &amp; acquisitions. Ultimately, only a handful of competitors can survive this process. </p><p>Problematically, because the market (which can never be peeled away from politics) naturally consolidates competition to a select few, market distortions like monopolies and cartels are inevitable. Due to political corruption and capture, centralized wealth and market dominance reliably defends itself in political landscapes which might otherwise regulate it through anti-trust. Thus, the stable long-term surviving competitors in capitalist markets will not only exploit workers, but also price gouge and extort consumers. Perhaps more problematically, the political tactics and tools used to defend their existence can go on to be wielded in even more disturbing ways.</p><p>The second and more classically described instability of capitalism is driven by the neverending pursuit and generation of competitive advantage. Capitalists compete with each other in the market, and thus they must continually reinvest in their constant capital to remain competitive.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button> A profound source of instability arises when capitalists generate competitive advantages by continuously whittling down their labor force to the fewest employees possible while simultaneously paying them as little as they will accept. As a consequence, wages are suppressed at all costs (morality is deemed irrelevant here) as human labor is squeezed for maximum production while price-efficiently replaced with technology and streamlined processes/logistics.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> </p><p>As human labor is replaced, workers become unemployed. Unemployment forces wages down. The unemployed, the army of reserve labor, compete for fewer available jobs. The higher the supply of laborers and fewer jobs available, the lower they must sell their labor-power to capitalists. Thus, capitalists are engaged in the continual process of maximizing the productivity value of labor while paying lower and lower wages to fewer and fewer people for it.</p><p>Over time, there are fewer and fewer employers hiring fewer and fewer employees, while simultaneously paying lower and lower wages. The unemployed become desperate. They will accept worse and lower material conditions just to survive. What other choice do they have? Essentially, this vicious cycle enables capitalists to tighten their grip on the working class. </p><p>Capitalists not only exploit but actually enslave workers insofar as workers have no other options. When capitalists own all the means of production, workers have no other choice but to accept wages artificially depressed further and further below the productivity value of their labor (if they can find employment at all). </p><p>As capitalists centralize power and monopolize the means of productions, there is a corresponding increase in the rate and degree of enslavement of the working class. In a vast human economic pyramid scheme, we find repeating cycles of wealth and power centralizing and rising to the top as capitalists disenfranchise workers. The working class loses opportunities, freedoms, and bargaining powers as they become splintered, suppressed, and controlled. Capitalism devours the majority of humanity.</p><p>In late stage capitalism, despite working so hard they barely have time to think about the state of the world, the working class slowly becomes aware of the causes of the crisis. As class consciousness develops, capitalists must oppress them even harder. Of course, workers who complain, bargain, or fight back will be punished. Submission appears to be the only practical option. Material conditions for the working class only continue to plummet, and eventually, they discover there are no peaceful ways to solve the problem.</p><p>Here the Crisis of Capitalism peaks, and the working class revolts <em>en masse</em>. Large political/economic structures collapse. A radical revolution occurs. The people take the power back. After the dust settles, society begins to rebuild, and socialist policies are instituted to protect the working class from vampiric capitalists. All is good, right? But, time passes, and generations fail to remember history. Slowly, socialist policies are relaxed or eaten away, and the seed of capitalism begins to grow yet again.</p><p>Rinse and repeat: all this has happened before, and it will happen again. Or, that's how the traditional version of the story goes.</p><h2 class="">Two Worries with the Conventional Critique</h2><p>By and large, the critique is correct. It points out the material dialectic, an oscillatory power dynamic experienced by humanity since the dawn of civilization. It is obviously an apt description of large scale human behavior. </p><p>Insofar as socialism relies upon material conditions of the Crisis of Capitalism to do its intellectual heavy lifting, it remains a mere description which lacks idealism. At this point, it is a mere tool for interpreting the historical cycles of humanity. Even if it correctly predicts revolution, it does not, in itself, show why we should revolt against capitalism and slavery. </p><p>Ultimately, socialism describes what &quot;is&quot; but not what &quot;ought.&quot; Marxist versions of socialism predict revolution as the outcome, but it cannot normatively prescribe it because it does not give us an underlying moral theory. Socialism doesn't actually give us a metaethical foundation for rejecting capitalism. It describes the capitalist process, but fails to justify why it's fundamentally bad or wrong. This is an easy fix though: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> (CI). </p><p>Conventional socialism provides us the contextual content of maxims. It's pretty obvious capitalism produces great evil given the standard of the CI. For prescription, we must attach an act to that context to complete the maxim for testing in the CI. I will not provide an analysis here, but it appears the CI morally justifies revolution. Thus, my first worry about the conventional critique of capitalism can be set aside for the moment. </p><p>My second worry is more disturbing. I disagree with the socialist description of the instability of modern capitalism. I believe it too optimistically posits an inevitably successful revolution, revolt, or uprising. Unlike previous history, I am not convinced that revolution is an accurate prediction in the information age. Marx could not have foreseen everything. He could not have predicted or understood the nature of modern technology used to protect the ruling class, enabling them to prevent, disarm, and defeat what used to be successful methods of revolution. The horror we must contend with is the possibility that modern capitalism is sufficiently stable and capable of maintaining the status of quo of enslavement until we eventually wipe out the most life on the planet. Essentially, there is a darker, Redpilled story we need to understand in order to build an effective maxim targeting modern capitalism.</p><h2 class="">Unmasked Redpilled Description of Capitalism:</h2><p>Before I dive into the Redpilled aspect of Socialism, in the spirit of intellectual honesty, I hope to provide you my more controversial philosophical assumptions in advance:<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button></p><ul><li>The Rule of Law cannot be accomplished without centralizing at least some power.<ul><li>Libertarian Socialism is flawed in the pursuit of pure anarchic anti-authoritarianism, however, they are generally correct in pursuing the decentralization of power.</li></ul></li><li>Slavery comes in degrees, flavors, and spectrums.</li><li>Ideal economics is the quantitative study of psychology; it attempts to model human interaction.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button><ul><li>The majority of economists and business programs aren't interested in truth insofar as it does not justify capitalism.</li><li>Politic science and economics do not peel apart. They can never independently exist in a vacuum because they are both facets of the same gem (or turd).</li></ul></li><li>Social Darwinism is largely pointing to something correct about all social species (including our own).<ul><li>Humans are fundamentally selfish, evil, and often irrational as defined by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a>.</li><li>Memes and genes determine who we are; we aren't blank slates.</li><li>Conscious freewill is an illusion<ul><li>It is also possible we aren't autonomous even under compatibilism.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Socialism describes capitalism as a socioeconomic system (or family of such systems) based on the exploitation of the labor force through private ownership of the means of production. Capitalism is intrinsically an anarchic, unregulated implementation of the social darwinian survival of the fittest algorithm applied to wealth and labor. Crucially, power generally continues to centralize and trickle-up in capitalism. Monopolies, monopsonies, slavery-based market distortions, political corruption, and the centralization of power are common outcomes and expressions of capitalism. Naive, primitive laissez-faire capitalism just is the brutal Hobbesian state of nature, and thus it is also a natural consequence of evolution. Might still makes right in modern capitalism; it's just harder to perceive it clearly.</p><p>In modern capitalism:</p><ul><li>Consent is a simulacrum.<ul><li>It is in name only, and it is never sufficiently informed.</li><li>It's manufactured.</li><li>There aren't practical alternative choices by poorly coordinated design.</li></ul></li><li>Asymmetrically, the ruling class is not subject to the rule of law.<ul><li>Voting systems are abused, purposely limited, and prevented from enabling representation.</li><li>The wealthy politically capture all major legislation, enforcement, and adjudication in most nations.<ul><li>i.e. Wealth strongly translates to political power.</li></ul></li><li>We're &quot;voting&quot; for one of two horses with the same owner.</li><li>They are transnationals who are no longer participating citizens of any nation.</li><li>They avoid the vulnerability of physical proximity by insulating and isolating themselves from the lower classes.</li><li>Their assets tend to be mobile, sheltered, untaxed, out-of-reach, and leveraged through shells.</li><li>Paradoxically, power is centralized but the corresponding responsibility is diffused and defused within corporate agency.</li></ul></li><li>Memetic coercion, distraction, and censorship are weapons used to suppress the masses.<ul><li>Meaning is hyperreal.</li><li>Trust is an illusion, and when the spell is broken, we are made to believe there is no other option besides a zero-sum game.</li></ul></li><li>Alternatives to capitalism are met with severe retaliation<ul><li>Socialism is targeted, contained, and undermined. </li><li>Physical coercion, policing, and warfare primarily exist to maintain capitalist power structures and prevent the spread of socialist power decentralization.</li></ul></li><li>Wealth inequality grows because wealth centralizes.<ul><li>The rate of return on capital is greater than the rate of economic growth.</li><li>Wealth inheritance maintains the concentration of capital.</li></ul></li><li>We are experiencing a mass version of the Stanford prison experiment.</li></ul><p>Modern capitalism is the result of an uncoordinated global installation of variegated Nozickian Libertarian governmental structures.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> Those in power viciously compete amongst themselves, but they also tend to symbiotically cooperate with each other insofar as it is necessary to deceptively advance, implement, and adapt a spectrum of policies which benefit them at the expense of the working class. Essentially, modern capitalism is a thin (but rhizomatically complex) libertarian abstraction over the pure state of nature. </p><p>Ponerogenic individuals and corporations who possess the will, knowledge, and means to manipulate the gears, buttons, and levers of the libertarian-capitalist abstraction are able to more efficiently obtain the enslavement that would have been produced without this mechanism. Capitalism is a cost-effective virtual state of nature optimized for enabling well-integrated,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> intelligent dark-triads to herd, domesticate, pilfer, and prey upon the rest of humanity. </p><p>Capitalist society is structured so as to reward the most socially adept abusers of human nature. Capitalism enables a psychopathic segment of our species to enslave us. While most humans delusionally attempt to play the game fairly, the most functionally evil human specimens play by different rules, striking below the belt and fighting with their gloves off. Capitalism is only a meritocracy for elite psychopaths. It is a system in which they possess fundamental competitive advantages owing to the fact that they don't play by the moral rules, and this inevitably gives way to their cyclical rise to power. It is a vicious game in which those with <em>weak moral compasses</em> and the means to recursively exploit the poor and powerless become increasingly successful (and eventually totalitarian) apex predators of our species.</p><ul><li>There is little or no hope our societies will change, evolve, or revolutionize so as to save us from enslaving each other and bringing the next mass extinction (including our own).<ul><li>That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Furthermore, that doesn't give us license to be immoral.</li><li>Transhumanism may be the only solution (insane as that may sound).</li></ul></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, politicians, law enforcers, and judges are capitalists bought by capitalists. From local, to regional, to nation-state, to international scopes, capitalists own and control the working class. Slavery only becomes more complex in implementation, kind, and degree. </p><p>Oppression branches out much further than that. Our surveillance state exists to maintain capitalist power. Our media is consolidated and owned by capitalists seeking to subvert and undermine resistance to their power. We are engaged in wars not for the freedom of our people, but for the enslavement of mankind, to the benefit of capitalists. </p><p>Too often, I see Redpillers conflate the &quot;is&quot; of capitalism with the &quot;ought&quot; which follows from the prescription. Essentially, these psychopaths think prescription and description are the same. That is the naturalistic fallacy is in its barest form.</p><p>Many fail to see capitalism for what it really is: a game theoretic, absurdly complex, psychopathically owned and operated form of slavery.</p><p>Capitalism is a helluva drug. It is an incredibly viral meme that injects itself into the core of its hosts so deeply that it alters their fundamental behaviors, empathies, hatred, beliefs, and desires in systematic, long-term ways. Our culture is being swallowed by this Egoistic memetic network crawling through the human species like an epidemic. It's tendrils control our minds. The allure of selfishness is too profound, especially for the powerful and those with the means to maximize their personal pleasure at the expense of anyone they can find the will power to dehumanize. It is quite the meme, this invisible-appearing force. It is a category of a kind of viral creature that exists and reproduces in our minds. </p><h2 class="">Prescription</h2><p>We're dealing in eschatology at this point, and I predict we will lose.

Sure, hope for the best, vote for it, teach people it, see the reason in it, morally expect us to follow socialized prescription, but you have to practical about what you predict will happen. It is basic utilitarianian thought that cannot be escaped. You hope for the best, but plan for the worst. I want to see the end of capitalism because it would honestly make the world a better place; it is the only chance for the survival of the human species. I'd love to have grandchildren, to see the world happy and healthy. But, it isn't going to happen. You must see the necessity of protecting our selves from the world and preparing for the inevitable disasters approaching our species. </p><p>I would be rejected from socialist circles for saying this. I want to point out that I'm not claiming &quot;if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.&quot; I support the end of capitalism, but I'm not convinced it will actually occur due to both the raw intelligence, wealth, and power of our ruling class and the stupidity, poverty, and weakness of the proletariat. </p><p>Only a fool would think that 3.5% of the population composed of proletarians would be able to overthrow the capitalist yoke; that noose is on tight, and the weapons of coercion are beyond what Marx could have fathomed. Inequality only continues to grow on the metrics that matter. Of course, there always remains the possibility that socialist revolution will occur (however small it may be). Until then, I'm going to prepare as though it isn't going to happen because that is the best evidence I have. </p><p>Basically, I think my socialist brethren are deeply wrong; there is a better and more accurate pragmatic socialist prescription. I will protect my family from a world of psychopaths, and I will try to do so without being psychopathic towards the world. Accepting the reality of our shitty human nature's accuratizes our predictions and therefore appropriately tempers our expectations. This is pragmatic hope. As far as I can tell, it is the best prescription I have at the moment.</p><hr><p>Idealogical Leanings:</p><ul><li>Accelerationist</li><li>Anarchist</li><li>Anarcho-Communist</li><li>Communizer</li><li>Communalism</li><li>Consevative</li><li>Democratic Confederalism</li><li>Democratic Socialist</li><li>Left Communist</li><li>Neoliberal</li><li>Libertarian Socialist</li><li>Liberal</li><li>Luxemburgist</li><li>Hoxha-Posadist</li><li>Maoist (Third-Worldist)</li><li>Marxist-Leninist</li><li>Marxist-Leninist-Maoist</li><li>Mutualist/Market Socialist</li><li>Orthodox Marxist</li><li>Posadist</li><li>Religious Socialism</li><li>Social Democrat</li><li>Socialist Feminist</li><li>Syndicalists</li><li>Trotskyist</li></ul><hr><ul><li>Classes<ul><li>Capitalists<ul><li>Hyperclass (The bleeding edge elite among the capitalists)</li></ul></li><li>Owners<ul><li>Bourgeois, Reactionary, Middle Class who aren't directly the Capitalists for their primary income.</li></ul></li><li>Renters<ul><li>The slaves, the bitches, proles, plebs; they don't own much of anything.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><hr><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/80ge9z/richard_d_wolff_here_professor_of_marxian/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/80ge9z/richard_d_wolff_here_professor_of_marxian/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://jonjayray.tripod.com/leftism.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://jonjayray.tripod.com/leftism.html</a></li></ul><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Of course, there is significant disagreement.

The larger disagreement among socialists tends not to be its descriptions of capitalism, but rather its prescriptions.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> Wage value is Variable Capital.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">3 : </span> Rate_of_Surplus_Value = Surplus_Value / Variable_Capital</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">4 : </span> I am annoyed by the use of the term <em>constant</em> here.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">5 : </span> Although, peeling the other surplus expenditures apart from profit is not actually that simple.

Regulation of human use of technology is necessary (particularly to protect our most important freedoms), but regulation of human economies even moreso. Automation is not the devil. It all depends on how we use it. Do not buy into the red herring of blaming technology instead of humankind. Doing so is as analogously foolish as the buying the Broken Window fallacy.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">8 : </span> A reactionary opposes proletarian revolution. 'In modern capitalist society the bourgeoisie is appropriately viewed as the reactionary class, since it not only totally opposes proletarian revolution, and even almost all reforms, but also regularly tries to reverse earlier reforms. When the ruling bourgeoisie ever does finally agree to any significant new reform it is only because they have been forced to; and even then they virtually always have the secret intention of reversing what they view as a temporary concession to the people at a later time.'</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">3 : </span> Psychology is ultimately qualitative.
