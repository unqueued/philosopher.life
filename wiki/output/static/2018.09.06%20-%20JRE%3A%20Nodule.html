My brother is feeling physical manifestations of anxiety. He is thinking about his weight. He is very much feeling the differences from his meds. This is good.</p><p>We talked about aphantasia, my brother's tactile mind eye's, and the constructivism of eisegetical poetry interpretations, virality of memes, the experience machine, etc. I hope I did not annoy him with my thinking about it. He said several things which took me down a:</p><p>-=][ Rabbitholed ][=- </p><p>My brother told me about getting angry at work. It was vividly emotional. I am glad that my brother is feeling and thinking about how he is feeling. His self-awareness does seem to be increasing to me. I think it is less or painful, or he somehow has more control of himself in some respect, this ability to focus on it.

If I understood correctly, she may not be interested in depression medication. I gave meds a try, and I kept having to hack my way into finding a solution. It's tough being your own medical advocate in capitalism, especially when you are depressed. Some people do not have treatment-resistant depression, and this is an important route to try if you are depressed.</p></div>
