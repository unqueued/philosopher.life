</p></blockquote><p>This is a question that has weighed heavily on me since the beginning of the wiki.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> This is the kind of writing which I used steganography and cryptography to hide from everyone except myself. It has been difficult to open up.</p><p>I am desperately worried about political privacy, but I'm not convinced I have a moral right to it in my context. So, your question is an interesting one. What do you think about it?</p><p>I do want others to read it, of course. I could privatize it further just for family and friends (although, this is still the most convenient method for them). Problematically, I think allowing it to be public is the only efficient method to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">Find The Others</a>. I'm forced to rely upon allowing strangers to read it somewhat conveniently from a technological perspective; that vulnerability is likely a requirement of my axiom. </p><p>There are many kinds of people I believe it would be better if they never see this wiki because it wouldn't be constructive or useful. I also think it would be a bad thing for most people to look at it. I do not hope for wildfire, instead, I currently hope to cast a net with very large holes in it to connect to not just strangers, but the right strangers. </p><p>It is incredibly unsafe to lose my privacy to this degree, but radical transparency is the practical price I must pay for radical moral integrity. Until I can reasonably convince myself otherwise, I'm morally obligated to continue to develop myself in the open. No pain, no gain.</p><p>I also don't want to be accused of building a site merely for virtue signaling to others. This really is addressed to me (and my children). I should try to put my time and money where my mouth is. </p><p>Optimizing this site on that particular side of technical things is pre-optimizing in my eyes. The ability for others to access the wiki is sufficiently functional for my usecase. One day, that may change. I'm looking further into it. I may actually move away from Tiddlywiki if I really felt that serving it, in the end, should be piece by piece instead of as a self-contained unit.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> I don't just feel that way; it's clear to me when I go through my snapshots.</sub></p></div>
