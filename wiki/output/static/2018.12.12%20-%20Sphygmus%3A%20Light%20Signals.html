WED 12:45 AM
Ha, yeah. I have no idea what to do about that. I may modify missing links to eliminate aliases from the list.
WED 12:47 AM
oh boy, I broke my wiki! Used $(currentTiddler)$ in the DefaultNewTiddlerTitle config and immediately got a &quot;maximum call stack size exceeded&quot; error! Reloaded the page and now I'm getting connection refused errors. :joy:
WED 2:02 PM
Seems like it was something to do with TiddlyServer; resetting the settings files and then deleting the offending config tiddlers fixed it. &lt;phew&gt;
WED 2:32 PM
I'm once again super glad for the ability to download my HTML single file backups for reference when the node.js version breaks!
WED 2:33 PM
Working on that right now.
WED 4:18 PM
Thank you!
WED 4:18 PM
On top of the other things, the singlefiles give me a space (and peace of mind) to screw up (which I need).
WED 4:18 PM
I can't get the $(currentTiddler)$ problem fixed in singlefile mode.
WED 5:28 PM
I figure it breaks specifically the DefaultNewTiddlerTitle due to recursion or something; something must be different with the journal tiddlers that lets it work (in 5.1.7, anyway)
WED 5:30 PM
...now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know why I expected it to work in that field?? There's no &quot;current tiddler&quot; when clicking the + button on the sidebar so of course it broke.
WED 5:32 PM
My aim was to change the &quot;new tiddler tagged with this one&quot; button, rather than the &quot;new journal tagged with this one&quot;.
WED 5:33 PM
I can't even get the date to work in new tiddler.
WED 5:34 PM
Gonna try a blank 5.1.18 and see if it is mine at fault.
WED 5:34 PM
Fails there too.
WED 5:36 PM
I suspect that has to do with the changes to rendering special characters in tiddler titles that they implemented in 5.1.18? Not //sure// but that's the change with the potential to break it that stands out to me
WED 5:37 PM
I hadn't looked at it before today but I suspect their improvement of the web server will definitely make upgrading more of a pain for me :sweat:
WED 5:38 PM
I use twproxy's authentication as a layer over the 5.1.17 web server and I expect twproxy won't work with 5.1.18? But I haven't checked yet aha
WED 5:39 PM
tho I'll look into Bob before doing any serious changes cause your description of multi-browser window editing has me droolin'
WED 5:41 PM
Btw, I adore your TWcode in our chats, lol. I've been doing that recently. I suspect one day they will come alive for me in my chats.
WED 5:42 PM
Yeah, there are a ton of server changes. Lots of people want to use it something like you've got it setup, and I'm not sure there is a great consensus on it.
WED 5:42 PM
I worry that Jed and Jermolene may have differences in opinion on that.
WED 5:43 PM
I've never used twproxy's authentication before.
WED 5:43 PM
I'm going to post for a solution to the $(currentTiddler)$ problem. Considering that is something they specifically mention in their docs, it is weird to see it break. I truly have no idea what I'm doing, lol. =)
WED 5:45 PM
When I start using a markup style a lot to write, the formatting shortcuts become habitual for me! Makes me have to think when using other clients with different markup XP
WED 5:49 PM
That's probably the biggest reason I'll keep TWCode and not switch to a markdown plugin - I like my muscle memory
WED 5:50 PM
That makes sense.
WED 5:50 PM
I've looked at other markup formats, and I've not found one that desperately makes me want to switch.
WED 5:51 PM
Do you think there's anything important missing in TWCode?
WED 5:52 PM
My memory is patchy, but Jermolene seemed not to want to expand the web server in the posts I read when I was researching it before I implemented my setup - I think the argument was that people could do it on their own with nginx or similar.

I generally agree with that view but also it seems like something enough people want that lowering the barrier to entry on that side might be better for expanding the user base.
WED 5:54 PM
If I understand correctly, it will be more performant and safer to leverage existing web servers (which have stood the test of time, heavy use, etc.). Proxying acts like Cloudflare in a way here.
WED 5:56 PM
I remember reading tobibear's opinion being that node was harder to secure, so I found a good article/tutorial on securing a node.js app and had at it myself. But not everyone will be willing to do that.

(Twproxy was something I must have found linked in the google groups while I was researching? It has the ability to link up with google Authenticator and serve over SSL, which I don't think tiddly's server does on 5.1.17. Of course it's behind an nginx reverse proxy too, but no authentication there.)
WED 5:56 PM

yeah, makes sense. I think their web server is just a fork/based on an existing npm server code base
WED 5:57 PM
It may be the case that trying to write the server for npm is itself a mistake.
WED 5:58 PM
It probably can never be performant enough.
WED 5:58 PM
I will be curious to see how this influences your setup.

you might be right! I don't know enough about these things :sweat_smile:

me too! :)</code></pre><p>Here's an interesting phenomenon for me: I have a harder time peeling my words from hers out of here than usual. It's usually really clear to me who said what even without the references. That's not true for some though.
