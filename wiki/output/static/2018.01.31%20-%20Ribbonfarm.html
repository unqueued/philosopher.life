The fact that most of us understand absolutely nothing of the medical jargon in the show underlines the fact that House‚Äôs appeal lies at a doctrinal level.
</p></blockquote><p>Yes.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Trust your right-brained pattern-spotting. Be a skeptical, data-driven empiricist. Add a moral compass. Tie it all together with storytelling. Be aware of, and exploit, the flawed doctrines of others. Do not be concerned about the morality of this: doctrinal flaws provide the moral justification for their own exploitation.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2019.03.26</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Ah. I feel like I have the first half. The exploitation, however, I do not have in me. One day I might, but I don't see it. It is exceptionally Libertarian though. Why should I not be concerned about it? It will drive me insane not to use people as they clearly use me. Is this really the only way to be happy? </p><p>What kind of exploitation? Escaping from doctrines because of their flaws is a kind of exploitation that I find moral. But, using others based upon their beliefs not so much, except insofar as those beliefs are flawed and I have profound ends. Wearing makeup is kind of like that. Manipulation is morally obligated in some cases, but I fear I will cross a line I've no right to. I just don't see it. </p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/01/19/boundary-condition-thinking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/01/19/boundary-condition-thinking/</a></li></ul><p>The quora question is worth thinking about.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You then sort out three types of model building blocks in the phenomenology: dynamics, constraints and boundary conditions (technically all three are varieties of constraints, but never mind that).
</p></blockquote><p>Omg, he's doing philosophy again! Yay!</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>So I operate by the vague heuristic that if I pay attention to things on the edge of the mainstream, ranging from motorcycle gangs to extreme couponers and hoarders, perhaps I can make more credible progress on big and difficult problems.</p><p>Or at least, that‚Äôs the leap of faith I make in most of my thinking.
</p></blockquote><p>Ah, I see. Yes, sir. You are correct. How else can you see the outline of things, the change? The essence of the thing itself can only be revealed after you have a form. You aren't looking to be well-rounded in any mainstream sense. You're only going to get the same wrong answers that everyone else gets in that arena. You must throw <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a> magic into it. You need randomness, edges, and the unexpected. Insight sometimes can only come from left field.</p><p>Why do you think I'm even reading <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Ribbonfarm.html">Ribbonfarm</a>? Ribbonfarm is actually Alt-Right (although, incredibly genius compared to most alt-right work). It's worth our time. Intellectual integrity is very much about looking at the corner cases. One must be antipleonasmic, find the shortcuts, etc. This is just that.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2019.03.26 : </span> Including that doctrinal statement, right? This is why you have to pursue that which has no flaw by definition, even fallibly. I don't think Rao's being mystical, but rather psychopathic here.</sub></p></div>
