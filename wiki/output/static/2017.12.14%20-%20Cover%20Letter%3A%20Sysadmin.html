<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I was very interested to hear about Milligan's recent opening for a system administrator. I believe I would be a good fit, both for the position and for the school community.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.24</sup></button></p><p>Computers are a paradise for me. Computing has been my craft since I was child. I've always been obsessed with learning, building, and improving computer systems inside and out because they are beautiful to me. I practice and do this work whether I get paid to or not; it's part of my vocation.</p><p>I enjoy researching, testing, and migrating to new tools, frameworks, platforms, and infrastructure. I take pleasure in configuring and upgrading environments, setting up appropriate permissions, automating tasks, tailoring workflows, piecing together process chains, troubleshooting networks, and building healthy ecosystems.</p><p>I'm comfortable with remote administration over command line, web interfaces, and remote graphical access tools. I also live 5 minutes away from the school, so it isn't problematic for me to handle midnight emergencies.</p><p>System maintenance is a passion of mine; the details matter to me. I'm diligent about keeping snapshots, redundancies, and backups because I know what's at stake. I pursue rolling releases, and I'm paranoid about security updates. I need my machines to run beautifully as matters of pride and satisfaction. When something goes wrong or doesn't function the way it should, I feel compelled to diagnose it, find the best solution, and fix it. I enjoy the challenges of putting out fires, triaging work loads, and planning ahead. </p><p>I'm not afraid of low-level work, new paradigms, asking questions, and negotiating the needs of multiple parties. I celebrate technical writing, generating clean documentation, and ensuring well-commented code. Being a good system administrator is about practicing the golden rule in meeting people's needs and making the next system administrator's job as easy as possible.</p><p>I prefer to use FOSS tools, but I'm happy to work with whatever is available to me. I see computers as critical tools and complex forces in our society, and I hope to help us use them wisely. My goal is to build computing systems which meet the needs of users while maintaining usability, efficiency, flexibility, security, and availability. </p><p>In addition to fulfilling the role of system administrator, I would be happy to join the Milligan community. I have worked in academic communities for years, and am comfortable there. More importantly, being Christian is fundamental to my identity, and it is why I serve people. I would love to once again work in an environment where I know I am helping to build a better world.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2018.12.24 : </span> This was an important test. I've learned far more about who they are through this process. As usual, my brother was kind to let me down gently.</sub></p></div>
