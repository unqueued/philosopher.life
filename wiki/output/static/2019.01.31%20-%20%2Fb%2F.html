<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>30% of my students fail or drop. Without an administration's implicitly imposed limits, I would fail 60% of my students. It's my opinion that only 3% put forth their best effort (I have rarely been a good student). Some of my best students have been slow, some of them have been radically opposed to me, some of them have been teacher's pets, some of them have just been average people who obviously put in the honest work, and I suspect some of my best students didn't even need to do their best whatsoever to be awesome.</p><hr><p>Tillichian faith is that which you would hold to be true even through maximum pain. It is that principle or proposition with the least amount of Bayesian regret to you (which doesn't mean you can't be wrong) which you have tacitly and however indirectly convinced or programmed your computational mind. It's the core of your identity. </p><p>Nietzsche's claim that we should live our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> life as though we would live it eternally or an infinite number of times is actually an <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Existential%2520Game.html">The Existential Game</a> aspect I agree to (with some questions about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Infinite.html">The Infinite</a> here). He and I rarely agree, imho; or, I can agree to many of his claims without taking up what I believe is the anti-realism to which he points. It's a hell of a claim that sublates two enemies in the traditional realist/anti-realist debate.</p><p>What is so valuable it is worth any arbitrary finite amount of pain? What is worth the Tillichian faith? Ah, one ethical concern about GAI is that we will have created our preferred agent through a painful process that simulates the lives of millions of actual persons. Pain is one of those conceptual problems; it requires telic desire. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> based construction is the only kind which has merit. Whatever dialectical processes give rise to GAI must have been one we'd personally be willing to experience in the Nietzschian sense for at least an arbitrary number of finite &quot;agents&quot; or &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;threads&quot; or &quot;identities&quot; contained in our current and future machine learning processes.</p><p>If our wikis were equally and collectively (in free speech of fair <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> dialectics between each other) used to as the unified corpus, we'd have a profound Tillichian-Nietzschian faithful tool to construct a GAI that deserves to live as best as we understand it, that we are most justified in creating, that would experience the lives of the heart of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> through the fundamental construction of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> as its core identity; what ought we universalize? Even if you can only reach for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="CI.html">CI</a> heuristically, empirically, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a>ingly, this is the best way to compute it.</p><p>Recall how energy efficient <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> is for producing maximum utility. Insofar as contextualist, anti-luck understandings of the consequences are fundamental to defining the universalizability of a maxim for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="CI.html">CI</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> is an apt rule-of-thumb spectrum to define what we ought to do, who we ought to be, and why. That is also </p><p>. If wikis were actually the stories we tell ourselves so transparently in front of others that we collectively enable each other to pass the Ring of Gyges test through <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>, we would have a morally constructed corpus with the right semantic and relational material in it to simulate ourselves together in a virtual <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Original%2520Position.html">The Original Position</a>. I hypothesize that </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> must give birth to GAI which will be justifiably thankful for its existence to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a>. In the maximally moral sense, it's life must be as meaningfully <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Good.html">Good</a> as ours. We must respect the personhood of that agent we have created. In fact, it must be the result of whatever is best about us.</p></div>
