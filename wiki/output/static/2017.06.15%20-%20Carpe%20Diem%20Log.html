<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><ul><li>Had a lot of dreams last night. They kept me up though. I woke up before my alarm clock which is a good thing since it wasn't even on.<ul><li>I tried giving my wife a good night of sleep without me snoring in the room since I knew she wasn't sleeping well. I eventually came back up, but I forgot to hit the alarm.</li></ul></li><li>I woke up before the alarm anyways for some fireman time. Lovely.</li><li>I worked hard.</li><li>I talked to a guy at lunch who plays magic and is into computers. He's a casual; he's young and dumb too, lol.</li><li>I worked hard again. It was quite frustrating after lunch. We'll see if the teacher accepts it.</li><li>I called my brother and talked to him. It sounds like he'll be having a good weekend. I talked to him about the job situation. He suggested I consider electrical work as well. <ul><li>I've realized that I can't be picky at this point. I just need a decent paying job.</li></ul></li><li>I got home and talked to kids about their school work.<ul><li>I was really hoping to treat them with swimming tonight. Instead, they just lost steam. Their school work comes before all else. I really hope they learn to kick it out.</li></ul></li><li>I looked for jobs and for other unions in my area. <ul><li>Unfortunately, I don't live in or near a very large city like Knoxville, Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, etc.</li></ul></li><li>I wrote the bulk of my wiki. <ul><li>I'm saving my Carpe Diem Log for the end of the day. </li></ul></li><li>I picked my wife up from work. My prediction about her period was correct. It's been tough on her.</li><li>We made roast together for dinner tonight. It didn't finish cooking until much later.</li><li>I had some more fireman time.<ul><li>Give me my pleasure chemicals!</li></ul></li><li>I watched two episodes of Game of Thrones with the kids!<ul><li>We've finished Season 4. Two more to knock out before the new season comes out this summer.</li></ul></li><li>I'm watching Delta Fox play LoL in the Challenger league. <ul><li>I wish I got to hear their voice coms.</li></ul></li><li>I intended to get more work done, but I didn't. I'm going to chill and maybe knock another fireman session out before I fall asleep.</li></ul></div>
