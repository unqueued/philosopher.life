<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Against daughter, mulled to 5. She opens with vial pass, I open lackey. Vial, lackey from her. I very slowly developed. Several key errors with her matrons allowed me to hang on. She swung with everything which bought me a lackey connect for Kiki-jiki. Hello Matron every turn. Krenko was the option because I didn't have the third red for chainwhirler. In a turn, I was on the beatdown. She ringleadered twice into Matron into Chainwhirler. Still having kikijiki, krenko, and warchief, I incinerated chainwhirler, made some dudes, and swung out the game.</p><hr><p>My son and I use our phones and play in different rooms.</p><p>My son, kept a colorless hand with vial, 2 lackeys, and a matron. Okay. My son had no red mana either, but didn't have vial. I let him mulligan after we figured that out. His mulled hand went waste-&gt;vial. Lol. Hilarious opener for us. I one lackey connect for matron, and given the board state, incinerator felt best. I should have went Chainwhirler. Son does it to me instead and matrons for trashmaster.  I matroned for chainwhirler. I lose my vial. Ouch. He warchiefed and swung into my chainwhirler with trashmaster included. Incinerator balances some power, board state in my favor. We were at a standoff with chainwhirler pinging. We blew each other's manabases up, with 2 warchiefs in play, he could still ringleader topdeck, picking up another warchief (ewww, sorry breh). I've been holding onto stingscourger the entire game, and I have enough board advantage that I can keep pinging. Bit of math, scourger swing with everything but one (incase of piledriver topdeck). Then topdeck chief into swing out for the last drop of damage necessary including blocks.</p><hr><p>Daughter game. She mulls. I keep vial, lackey, matron. Since I'm on the play, I lackey. She goes vial. I connect, matron, chainwhirler, waste her, and drop my own vial (jesus christ). She has no land drop, ouch. Damn girl. Vials skirk, but uses it to block my matron with my lackey sitting pretty. Lackey connect, matron-&gt;cratermaker, then blew up vial and second waste. She has no board. Lackey into ringleader picks up trashmaster. The game ends with my army vs a single mountain.</p><p>She demands a rematch.</p><p>I keep a hand with lackey (she has me play?). Warchiefs and a chainwhirler make it keepable. chainwhirler alone might just make it keepable. That card is fucking broke in this matchup. One-sided pseudo-wraths are the tits. We trade lands. I chainwhirler, lackey connect, warchief. Waste her waste, warchief, swing for 10. I ended up showboating the last turn, with 4 ringleaders via warchief and prospectors chaining into 24 damage swing. Noice.</p><hr><p>Keep lackey, vial, driver, chainwhirler. OMG, <em>so blessed</em>. He lackeys. I Vial. I pray he doesn't have incinerator; he MWMs. Chainwhirler, ouch. He warchiefs. I drop vial and matron-&gt;kikijiki. He ringleaders. I whiff a turn. He cratermakers my piledriver. I'm screwed on mana, drop SS, kiki just sitting in my hand (noicely done mate). He ringleaders for MWM, Skirk, and Kiki. Fuck me. Doesn't matter, I have mine first. Chainslinger and SS the board with 5 to face off the triggers. Port keeps him down. And, then I showboat with all the shenanigans to style on him with a sacced board channeled through SS. I am the worst dad.</p><hr><p>Late night game with son. Pretty back and forth. Sharpshooters at different stages  f</p></div>
