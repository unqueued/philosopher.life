<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I never know what you really expect in these reflection pieces (you rarely have anything to say about them, so I take it as a good sign). I have pages and pages of notes, but I don't want to flood you with my thoughts, concerns, or questions. Sometimes I just go with whatever struck me in the gut the most, whatever I'm most passionate about. With that in mind, here is my reflection:</p><p>I find the claim that three formulations are logically equivalent to be an interesting one (I enjoy logic and ethics). I see two paths for getting at the equivalence of the formulations of the moral law.</p><p>First, perhaps we can phrase or assume each these formulations as logical truths, and if we can, then they are logically equivalent.  All logical truths are logical consequences of each other, which means they are all logically equivalent. So, I have to ask: are Kant's formulations of the moral law logical truths? To be clear, a logical truth is true in all possible worlds (i.e. true in every model). Isn't the moral law like that? I think so, or I wouldn't call it moral law (necessary, universal, absolute, etc.). Maybe Kant's formulations fail to capture the semantics of the moral law, but surely the moral law is a logical truth. If establish Kant's formulations are logical truths, and we have good reasons to think they might be, then we have proven they are logically equivalent.</p><p>That said, logical equivalence, particularly regarding logical truths, is perhaps weirder that some might initially realize. For example, 2+2=4, or Smaller(a,b) ‚Üî Larger(b, a), and P ‚à® ¬¨P are all logical truths, and hence they are also equivalent to the moral law (assuming the moral law is a logical truth). It is odd to say that 2+2=4 is equivalent to the moral law. I kind of like it though. </p><p>If we can't think of these formulations as logical truths (which means they can be falsified in some possible world), then the second way is to assume the biconditional relationship between all three formulations in our domain. If those biconditonals are logical truths (i.e. the formulations share the same truth values not just in our domain, but all possible domains) then the relationships are not merely biconditional, but logical equivalent. This is a weaker claim, in some sense, than the previous, but this may be what Kant meant (I don't know). This is the route which I think most people would be tempted to take when they try to establish equivalence. This route seems odd to me though, since the moral law would turn out to be falsifiable in some possible world. I'm not convinced that is even coherent.</p><p>The first path allows us to simply analyze each formulation individually. If we can establish them as logical truths, then the work is done. It seems to be much harder to go the biconditional route, in which we actually do have to analyze the relationships between the various formulations. It seems the dilemma O'Neill poses on 127 is hardly a dilemma at all if we go by this first path. She seems to be going for something like the second path.</p><p>That said, I worry the reason I've never heard of the first path is that logical truths are generally considered analytic, and if memory serves me correctly, Kant claims the moral law is synthetic a priori (I'm not entirely sure I really, deeply understand this notion). This may or may not be a problem, I don't know. Even if the law were synthetic a priori, it is not immediately obvious to me that the moral law can't be a logical truth.</p><hr><p>Instances where consent matters seem to be a subset of instances where respect is required. Consent does not completely outline what respect for persons means.</p><p>What can or can't a person consent to?</p><p>How can I simultaneously be treating someone as an end, but as a secondary effect be using them? (e.g. sex) ‚Ä¶ the requirements of consent scale with epistemic ability</p><p>What does it mean for a child to give consent? Presumably, the requirements are high ‚Äì we have to feed them more information, we have structure the questions in ways they actually comprehend. There is an entire context we have to lay out for them before they can begin to understand the question, a context that more experienced humans would already have. Getting consent is impractical, it seems.</p><p>Consider the case of impairment or children. What if it took years and billions of dollars to get their consent? Should we spend that in each case? We won't. We resort to paternalism. But, is this morally acceptable? It seems practical, but even practical options aren't necessarily the morally right ones. Why can we be paternalistic? We aren't ideal agents, as mature adults with full human faculties either ‚Äì we are limited.</p><p>We must take each other's epistemic limitations seriously. There is a difference between getting the consent of an ideal epistemic agent and a finite, limited agent (such as humans).</p><p>O'Neill rules out seduction, but considers all contractual relationships (which don't count as economic fraud, whatever that means) to be kosher. That seems unlikely to me. Marxist problem, he eventually considers. Nm, he seems to get it.</p><p>Who cares about legal consent? Legal obligations only have meaning qua moral obligations. Moral consent, moral contracts, and moral obligations are all that matter in the ultimate analysis.</p><p>Consent requires us to: Discover the morally significant aspect of plans, proposals, and actions.</p><p>Hypothetical Consent</p><p>What does it mean to ask ‚Äúwhether the fully rational would consent‚Äù? We aren't rational enough to answer the question in most cases, it seems to me.</p><p>Getting consent means ‚Äúdoing the best we can with what we have.‚Äùs What more could be required of us? If we are limited in our ability to give consent, why aren't we also limited in our ability to get it? The moral show must go on though.</p><p>I'm fat. A ultra-rational person might say I need to be forced into hard exercise and have my diet controlled. I need some brainwashing to get fit and to want to be fit and continue to try to be healthy. Would this coercion be acceptable?</p><p>‚ÄúPerson‚Äù is used in a tricky fashion here. Before he defines consent, I feel he needs to elaborate on what he means by person.</p><p>Significant and Spurious Consent</p><p>Moral consent is a consent to the deeper, fundamental aspects of another's proposals, but not all all aspects of another's proposals.</p><p>Morally significant consent requires the possibility of consent or dissent. Those trying to get consent have to make both options possible.</p><p>What are the universal necessary conditions for consent? What are the contextual, sometimes necessary conditions for consent?</p><p>We must take into the particularities of persons, understand their particular limitations, surrounding their ability to dissent and consent. We have to treat them as the persons they are.</p><p>Possible Consent: a Kantian reading</p><p>If Kant is going to match my intuitions, I have to particularize maxims. Consent, in this case, seems to focus too much on deception and lying (which Kant is notoriously incapable of handling in an appropriate, intuitive manner).</p><p>Is my maxim obvious to the other....vs...would the other person agree to my maxim? Can they share my maxim?</p><p>Treat others not as (or merely?) means but as ends in themselves. Their endness places limits on us. Respect is about respecting the limits (pg 114).</p><p>I'd like to point out that normally I might think of respect as giving me positive perfect duties, but we can handle this in limits language. Suppose the set of all possible action/motivation pairs, the endness duty places limits on which of those are viable ‚Äì i.e. it limits all the possibilities down to one ‚Äì which means it is a perfect duty.</p><p>If we only knew that a person was rational and autonomous, then we'd only have the negative standard. The particularities of each person (as a human, as a wife, as a finite creature, etc.), however, give us the positive standards.</p><p>We can give no determinate account for the capacities of action of limited rational beings. Presumably, we could give such an account for unlimited, ideal rational beings. That might be true. I think desires might still be possible in ideal beings, and desires are particular to each person in my view (although, Kant would disagree).</p><p>The moral law is the same for everyone only in the particularized, contextualized sense. If you find your self in limited rationality position X, which is a part of circumstance Y, then you should do Z with this W intention and motivation.</p><p>There is a tension between love and respect. Love is wanting the best for someone, according to what you understand the ‚Äúgood‚Äù (or happiness) to be. Respect is seeking the best for someone, according to their understanding of the ‚Äúgood.‚Äù??? What about an objective one? Why should we agree? What about someone who has a wildly better grasp of the good?</p><p>Sharingh others ends. We are limited creatures as well, so there is only so much we can do, so many ends we can share. We, as human Respecters and Respected, all have limitations.</p><p>The core of gaining consent is avoiding deceit and coercion. Thanks.</p><p>Universal Laws and ends-in-themselves</p><p>I find the claim that three formulations are logically equivalent to be an interesting one. I see two paths for getting at the equivalence of the formulations of the moral law.</p><p>First, perhaps we can phrase or assume each these formulations as logical truths, and if we can, then they are logically equivalent. The fact is that all logical truths are logical consequences of each other, which means they are all logically equivalent. So, I have to ask: are Kant's formulations of the moral law logical truths?
