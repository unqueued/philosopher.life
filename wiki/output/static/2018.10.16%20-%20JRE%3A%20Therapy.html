<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Required chat to jumpstart for me to call him. I don't know what's wrong! </p><p>I walked in the rain while we talked. I like rain and nipples.</p><p>He called me immediately after therapy. He's worried he is biased and doesn't know what or who to trust in this process, and not without obviously significant philosophical justifications, imho. His therapist says he isn't in the bidness of questioning the purpose of life, but will help my brother in dealing with the problem of whether or not to have a child (or rather, the end question is whether or not he wants to maintain his relationship with Rebecca). </p><p>My brother is concerned that he's having a hard time making people laugh. This is a very important sign to my brother, especially when it comes to being able to make himself laugh.</p><p>My brother is wrestling with whether or not it is suitable for him to pursue having an easy life. With a point he had spoken about with his therapist and wasn't totally sure about it (understandably). I fear I am of no use to my brother here. I am listening as carefully as I can though. I have also presented my best understanding of purpose, but I can't make these kinds of decisions for him. </p><p>My brother was wiped out after the session. It was clearly some heavy emotional lifting, and the counseling hadn't even &quot;begun&quot; (context gathering, etc.). </p><p>My brother has another therapist lined up (his work offers two different options, IIRC). I asked him what he is looking for in his therapist. Imho, he probably needs someone who agrees or disagrees with him and explains why. I am, of course, highly suspicious of everyone. I offer the guarded advice of elves to my brother here, since I do not know either way.</p><p>We mentioned my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.10.14%2520-%2520ALM%253A%2520The%2520Discussion.html">treatise</a> concerning <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ALM.html">ALM</a>.</p><p>My brother saw a bad accident as he drove home. I like that my brother takes the time to call me when he's out in the world and at home. Either way, he thinks talking to me is worth his time. </p><p>After the call, I walked back home with Ranga. We stutterstepped back to the house together underneath my umbrella.</p></div>
