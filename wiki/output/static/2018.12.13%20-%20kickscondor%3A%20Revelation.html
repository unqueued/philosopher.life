You give me quite a gift. You asked The Mule to take off his boxing gloves; don't be surprised to find yet another brawling, broken, recurring jester inside. You do like keepin' it real, dontcha? With no intention of failing,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">fh</sup></button> I'm gonna fuck you up. C'mon, get your dukes up, Durden. I can't give you a satisfactorily coherent answer by my standards; I can offer neither of us epistemic closure. You ready for that? I adore that you both know and think you know I'm incoherent (despite my best efforts).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">lp</sup></button> Here goes, homie.</p><p>You have pushed the button, and now I may not hold back what I have to say. I am not a nice man even when I'm trying to be kind. I'm truly an insufferable human being in most contexts (though not all). I'm every bit the enraging, dogmatic, disdainfully argumentative, judgmental, self-possessed sonofabitch you might <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> I am not (which isn't to say there is nothing lovable or noble about me; ofc, I'm not <em>just</em> that). Indeed, I think you know my kind very well; I'm convinced you have significant personal experience with religious zealots like me (this wiki is no accident). I was raised to be a prophet. I shit you not. Can you imagine the audacious insanity of having <strike>parents</strike> donors who marked their son with this disfigurement? I yam what I yam. Think hard, and you will know my name; I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a> to be angelic, prophetic, and a man of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Good.html">Good</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bh</sup></button></p><p>It is difficult for me to know when either of us are joking or being serious at times (no, I'm not joking!<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">nf</sup></button>). It appears you think I take your jokes too seriously, and I'm worried you all-too-charitably don't take mine seriously enough. My jokes are devolving half-truths; they are genuine broken thoughts made ironically silly as I seriously lose my mind.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pm</sup></button> You are too well-traveled not to know where I am in the desert; you've seen it too (it's written on your face; no one reacts the way you do without having lived that meaningfully meaningless nightmare). You appear to be here with me, deep in the desert, hunting for the motherlode of spice. We have both seen strains of this desert madness before.</p><p>Yet another beautiful aspect of your communications is that you inspire paranoia in a lovingly constructive way. You cause doubt playfully and kindly. It's not mere rhetoric; you have so much reasonable purpose in your words that it hurts.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">dn</sup></button> That's part of what makes you such a good philosopher.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">na</sup></button> I'm indebted to your skepticism. I do my best not to respect people accidentally; and, yes, you have earned it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">cl</sup></button> I will warn you again: I think you should carefully rethink how much you purport to purport to respect me. </p><p>I'm afraid you do not take my literality literally enough. I'm doing my best to honestly mean what I say and say what I mean, including this sentence. I'm never gonna escape this paradox. <em>I am a box of contradictions, sir.</em> Are you paying attention?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pa</sup></button> I'm dead serious in {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}. Everything drips with moral meaning all the way down! I'm certain of it, and I'm certain I'm not certain of it. When all things are possible, nothing is necessarily possible. Faith certainly blows, my Screwtape brother. I'm eating away at me. My internal model of the external standard is so high it constructs and deconstructs everything in me, including itself. My uselessly referential Neurathian ship is sinking into the abyss. No one in their right mind would exit the ready-to-hand mode so extensively they would read or write a wiki like this one unless something was undeniably all wrong (we must both be crazy).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">cr</sup></button> Without attempting to be ironic in the least: this wiki is an epic monument to brokenness.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">brag</sup></button> </p><p>I must have the access codes to Zion.

What's in your beetlebox? Climb up your ladders of meaning you don't really, really believe in and tell me what metamodern sincerity appears to mean from up there.

So...you are asking me to treat you as I treat myself? Jesus Christ, you really <em>are</em> stupid. Have I hurt your feelings by not hurting your feelings enough?

Talking to you is like talking to myself. <strong>How dare you!</strong> I can't cast you out of me, sinner, especially because I suspect the non-trivial possibility your unspoken reasons and experiences may be just as valid, profound, and uniquely broken as mine. Unfortunately, the labels I give you just aren't meaningful enough to me (that doesn't mean I should give up; that route too has no meaning). Internalism is a virus I'm forced to wrap and accept. There is no game without at least two players. You stick the quarter in me, but is it just for the funsies, warm fuzzies, and wordie-word pictures? I don't think you think I'm just a game. I think you really do believe there is real beauty and purpose in our conversation. I know courage when I see it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">kc</sup></button> I'm convinced you know <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Beautiful.html">The Beautiful</a> is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Good.html">Good</a> beyond even your beholding.

I know you are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Human.html">Human</a>. If you aren't, then I'm not either.</p><p>I'm so ready not to have a choice in my faith.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">fa</sup></button> I long for the delusion. I would bask in the freedom of finally being unbreakably enslaved to a self-bonding principle. I don't want to be myself anymore, at least not the autonomous version of me. I am resolved to resolve. It would be bliss, sir. Indeed, you appear to wield significant power over me in the information asymmetry of our conversations. I guess you are my BDSM-buddy; you dom and I sub? Perhaps you are the top(-down), and I'm the bottom(-up); you keep sticking it in me. Who's the model, and who's the modeler? Are you enjoying yourself? Does my empathy taste good to you?</p><p>I appreciate that I do not scare you off easily, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="kicks.html">kicks</a>. Most people who would see me like this flee in terror. Indeed, the truth must sometimes be ugly in order for it to sometimes be beautiful. You tolerant so-and-so, you. Have I covered all the stages of grief thus far in this letter? My emotional machinegun is empty; are you still standing there? If so, I do not know how or why.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bro</sup></button> I will sit in the ashes and weep with you in the desert, Sir.

I'm still trying to figure out whether or not it's worth the time. I suggest the distinction between the web and the net has been collapsing for some time, and I'm cynical about the indie framework/protocol treadmill (along with the rest of them, and I am, ofc, just a skiddie). Perhaps that is obviously mistaken. The difference between my expectations (ought) and predictions (is) remains vast, and I don't predict it changing (though we must try). I'm tired of half-measures and duct-tape; my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> runs dry in compromise. I'm still convinced <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Tim%2520Berners-Lee.html">the fundamental structure of the internet is wrong</a>. I hope there will be a moment where you can think about what <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="BDS97.html">BDS97</a> is constructing (and, yes, we have seen many attempts at this too). </p><p>Syndication is a serious problem. I don't adore CnPing from across so many pages and apps, including moderation, sanitization, and TW-encoding. In too many cases, I suggest the best non-committal, agnostic move and most UNIX-y option is to build workspace/mouse/keyboard macros to copy, parse (I'm probably going to be lazy here), and paste. I'd probably tag the tiddlers &quot;Awaiting Moderation&quot; with everything else put into place (some problems in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Recent.html">Recent</a>/<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a> I've seen here, but that can be fixed), and my export to singlefile would filter that out. Meh. This does seem like a job best done by hand.</p><p>I also grant there is a gap between those who care enough to manually check and those would care enough if only they didn't have to manually check (and I'm not sure if it is valuable enough for me to cross that bridge).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">vb</sup></button> As usual, there's no protocol to rule-them-all. I am considering the possibility that a query built via <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Search%2520of%2520h0p3.html">Search of h0p3</a> could be used by an extension, app, or even a self-updating version of the wiki itself to pinpoint the conditions for a &quot;notification.&quot; Perhaps one day there might be an even more customizable <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Update Scanner Add-On</a>. I'd prefer syndication/custom-subscription was done clientside using just the imported wiki as input.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">madc</sup></button> I want to emit exactly one thing: a single html file. I don't trust any software stack enough to invest otherwise. I don't know what I'm really doing though.  That's probably crazy, and I am grateful for your advice and thoughts on the matter. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Oh, I agree with you‚ÄîI do the same thing on my site. I don‚Äôt ever use a query (filterlist)‚ÄîI always hardcode links. It‚Äôs too important to lay it out right. It also forces me to limit the amount of meta-pages I have. I think they have to be used judiciously because people aren‚Äôt going to wade through a whole lot of meta. Those kind of automatic pages always lead to bland, repetitive layouts.</p><p>It‚Äôs evident that you hand-build your pages and they are 10x more appealing as a result (e.g. your link logs are ace).
</p></blockquote><p>We are back to the form vs. function debate. I regret that I do not know much about it, but I'm trying to figure it out.</p><p>I intend to continue handcrafting my wiki (I'm not convinced this could be an act of autonomy if I didn't).
