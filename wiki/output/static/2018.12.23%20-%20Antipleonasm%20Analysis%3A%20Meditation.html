<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Respond to the following:</h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Theories%2520of%2520Meditation.html">Theories of Meditation</a>:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><ul><li>Buddhism (i.e. Pali Canon):<ul><li>Buddhism claims the self arises through the presence of craving and identifying with this craving, and this delusion, or ‘defilement,’ propagates through and infects our entire experience. Meditation helps because by ‘noting and knowing’ experiences which arise, we can notice their impermanence, and notice that what we call the ‘self’ is an illusion and our sensations don’t really have an ‘owner.’ Over time as we keep doing this, we slowly generate the inference space to build better intuitive perspectives on the real dynamics of our minds, and we feel less of a compulsion to reflexively cling to our objects of craving or aversion (or the craving/aversion itself). This ‘spaciousness’, or freedom from the usual web of intentionality, allows us to develop the seven enlightenment factors (mindfulness, wisdom, energy, rapture, relaxation, concentration, equanimity), and ultimately the conditions which sustain the self / craving / suffering can drop away.</li></ul></li><li>Predictive Coding (i.e. Friston's Free Energy Principle):<ul><li>Predictive coding is a formal framework which says that the brain’s core drive is to minimize surprise, and that it does this by constantly creating, testing, and adjusting stories about the world. This is a two-tier system: the first ‘tier’ is subconscious prediction, which tries to filter out the ‘easy stuff’ using simple algorithms. You don’t feel the weight of your shirt against your skin, or the pressure of your shoes, or hear the traffic in the background, because this stuff is easy for your brain to categorize then ignore. But if your brain’s subconscious can’t predict something— say you get bitten by a snake, or you fail a midterm you thought you passed— then this stuff gets sent up for the conscious mind to deal with. Essentially, the mind is a story-telling machine, and we make our stories out of the ‘unusual’ signals the unconscious brain can’t explain away. The more surprising/salient something is, the more the brain thinks it’s probably important and should be a part of whatever story we’re telling ourselves, and the more ‘sticky’ it feels. ... Under the predictive coding model, I’d describe the process of meditation as attempting to ‘tag’ sensations early in the prediction pipeline as “okay/nothing to worry about/not anomalous/not something to update on/doesn’t have to be part of our story”, before the sensation becomes high-confidence and sticky and needs to be part of the story.</li></ul></li><li>Connectome-specific harmonic waves:<ul><li>All systems with periodic activity have natural modes, frequencies they ‘like’ to resonate at. Wineglasses, tuning forks, and guitars have them; the brain has them too. Connectome-specific harmonic waves (CSHW) is a new but promising paradigm for defining and measuring these natural harmonic modes in brains. ... How does meditation affect the brain? In the short-term, the ‘noting and knowing’ of meditation may act to dampen specific harmonics before their activity spills over into others and becomes self-propagating, leading to a quieter mind with a better signal-to-noise ratio.</li></ul></li><li>Neural annealing:<ul><li>Annealing involves heating a metal above its recrystallization temperature, keeping it there for long enough for the microstructure of the metal to reach equilibrium, then slowly cooling it down, letting new patterns crystallize. This releases the internal stresses of the material, and is often used to restore ductility (plasticity and toughness) on metals that have been ‘cold-worked’ and have become very hard and brittle— in a sense, annealing is a ‘reset switch’ which allows metals to go back to a more pristine, natural state after being bent or stressed. I suspect this is a useful metaphor for brains, in that they can become hard and brittle over time with a build-up of internal stresses, and these stresses can be released by periodically entering high-energy states where a more natural neural microstructure can reemerge. ... Furthermore, from what I gather from experienced meditators, successfully entering meditative flow may be one of the most reliable ways to reach these high-energy brain states.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote class="tc-quote"></blockquote></blockquote><ul><li>Buddhism<ul><li>See Frankfurtian Autonomy. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SO.html">SO</a> desires targeting other <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SO.html">SO</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="FO.html">FO</a> desires just is this model. The intuition appears to be able our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fastmind.html">fastmind</a>'s ability to automate aspects of Frankfurtian self-modeling and self-control.</li><li>The denial of self is not coherent. Who is doing the denying? I agree that we face an <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="infinigress.html">infinigress</a> problem in the alignment of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SO.html">SO</a>; that resounding commitment is paradoxical. I'm not a compatibilist either (like Frankfurt), but I can see this is necessarily part of what we are. We reprogram ourselves. That we can deny some parts of ourselves to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> is essential to our autonomy.</li><li>Lots of woo here, but it points to something crucial.</li></ul></li><li>Predictive Coding<ul><li>If Frankfurtian autonomy is the rationalist side of defining what it means to be free, this is the empirical hardware explanation of our probabilistic inferences.</li><li>&quot;Minimize surprise&quot; is a cute way to say it. I suggest that it's not that simple, but is often reducible to that (like cmc/benefit ratios in magic). The evolutionary pressures seek this kind of generalized efficiency, but there are clear exceptions</li><li>Clearly, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fastmind.html">fastmind</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="slowmind.html">slowmind</a> are right here. This is what I'm talking about. It is virtue-theoretic. It is part of a Hegelian dialectic inside us. It is the Heideggerian read-to-hand vs present-at-hand. This notion has many names. One of the issues here is really understanding: &quot;who is the boss, the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fastmind.html">fastmind</a> or the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="slowmind.html">slowmind</a>?&quot; That turns out to be at the heart of autonomy over desires, virtue, and knowledge.</li><li>The notion that we are telling ourselves the stories of who we are screams out of here. Clearly, I think this is where all the marbles are. This is the best explanation I have found.</li></ul></li><li>Harmonics<ul><li>It's all about them good vibrations, man. Lol.</li><li>If this isn't woo, then it's just talking about the natural suitability of algorithms and data structures (be it hardware or software). This seems like a pleasing way to visual efficiently using our computers <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a>, in the fitting <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="gfwiwcgws.html">gfwiwcgws</a> way, etc. When I use monitoring and log software on my machine, I get a feel for the bottlenecks. </li><li>I think this is reducible to the predictive coding claim.</li></ul></li><li>Neural Annealing<ul><li>My children and I speak about plasticity often. It's important for them to understand their brain development and the windows they have to shape their <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a>. This is part of our autonomy. The crystallization and stripping away of our neural pathways and memories is part of the efficiency built into our brains.</li><li>Virtue appears to be about constructing and reconstructing our probabilistic neural pathways. I am strongly reminded of some aspects of ML here. The ability to maximize plasticity or achieve this harmonic balance after practice may have serious merit.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In short, these all seem to be correct to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>.</p></div>
