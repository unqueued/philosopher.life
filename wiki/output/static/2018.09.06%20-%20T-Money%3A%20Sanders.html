This though... Too much.

 It's meme like this that keep me coming back to Facebook. Hahah
5 hours ago
 What do you think about that meme?
5 hours ago
 So its making fun of nike and their kapernick advertisement. Which has taken conservatives by storm. Which in it of itself is humorous. And the internet is overrun with bad memes about just do it. But this funny on more than one level. I like sanders. He has consistently stood for what he believes. From civil rights to modern wage gap.
5 hours ago
 Makes sense.
5 hours ago
 I agree it's funny too. I just wanted to understand what you thought was funny about it.
5 hours ago
 It's a basic joke on his campaign of expanding social programs at the expense of the taxpayer. Nothing more.
5 hours ago
 This is one of the problems with irony and parody. It can dogwhistle or satisfy the worldviews of multiple people at once. Reminds me of conservatives who took The Colbert Report at face value, or hatewatching Bill O'Reilly, etc.
5 hours ago
 That would keep me coming back to FB too. I think it's why I've regularly stopped to read 4chan since we were in college. Voat is another one of those interesting places.
5 hours ago
 Can't look away, even if it's a catastrophe
5 hours ago
 I was annoyed by the kneeling of the NFL players. But I don't even watch football. I was more annoyed at the general publics correlation to how his kneeling means he didn't support our military or he hated America. Southpark did an episode on it. It was flipping halarious. But everything Southpark does, is.

 Aye

 So if you can do computer programing, what about cell phone apps?
5 hours ago
 I really don't like my phone.
5 hours ago
 It's not designed for me to have control of it
5 hours ago
 (quite the opposite)
5 hours ago
 I've had smart phones since they came out, but I've always hated them.
5 hours ago
 The options are really limited.
5 hours ago
 So, I can program CLI tools in Termux on Android (and I'm sure iOS has something like it).
5 hours ago
 I program applications built by other people more than writing my own software for it.
5 hours ago
 Although, I've written software that runs on Android, I've not made anything useful.
5 hours ago
 I build my computing life around my Desktop/Laptop as much as possible.
5 hours ago
 I ask, because I have a small handful of million dollar applications/ideas that I think could be profitable. I will have to run them by you sometime.
5 hours ago
 neat =)
5 hours ago
 I have a sweet desktop, but I find I'm on my phone 90‚Ä∞ of the time.
5 hours ago
 I do not know how you do it. I know that is very normal.
5 hours ago
 I regularly have 300-500 tabs open across several firefox windows in a workspace just for my link log (https://philosopher.life/#Link%20Log:%5B%5BLink%20Log%5D%5D). I can't surf the internet on a phone, no matter how much I attempt to streamline the process.
5 hours ago
 Facebook offered the snap hat creators $3billion and he turned it down. They reared the app in college...
5 hours ago
 I don't even use a mouse most of the time at this point; I have to navigate by keyboard.
5 hours ago
 aye
5 hours ago
 Good gracious. That's too many windows. That's insane.
5 hours ago
 I read a lot.
5 hours ago
 I get anxiety if I have double digits. Haha
5 hours ago
 I have app ideas, btw.
4 hours ago
 I just don't think that I want to build a tool only for a phone; I'd want a tool that stretches across all the ecosystems
4 hours ago
 some of my favorite software is usable across every major platform
4 hours ago
 I can't say I'm really interested in money in the end. I have different goals.
4 hours ago
 e.g. https://philosopher.life/#The%20Original%20Position:%5B%5BThe%20Original%20Position%5D%5D%20Outopos
4 hours ago
 I am interested in perusing my dreams unhindered by working a jobs to make money to afford to live.
4 hours ago
 Haha.
4 hours ago
 I understand one must work to live.
4 hours ago
 I think even once you retire, you should still have a valuable work. It's vocation.
4 hours ago
 I don't disagree. Maybe something that doesn't require me to get up at 4am! Hah.
4 hours ago
 I can agree to that too. =)
4 hours ago
 I should point out another thing for apps: my thesis and dissertation were wholesale attacks on intellectual property (against Lockean/Kantian and Utilitarian arguments of it).  https://www.fsf.org/ is about where I'm at. Even my wiki is public domain.
4 hours ago
 Free and Open Source software or bust for me. I did write software at Humana. It was fun, but as I said, it was evil.

Your lack of selfishness is appalling.
