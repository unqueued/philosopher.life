<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Dear T-Money,</p><p>I said I would think about your words of wisdom and respond. You told me you were inebriated toward the end, so I'm not sure if you really want me to take these as your words or not. I'll be doing my usual quote and reply:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I listened to the introduction to radical market clip that you sent...Not sure what you thought I would gain from it?
</p></blockquote><p>You don't seem impressed by the introduction to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Radical%2520Markets%253A%2520Uprooting%2520Capitalism%2520and%2520Democracy%2520for%2520a%2520Just%2520Society.html">Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society</a>. Do you really think you have nothing to gain from this book? I would be surprised to hear that you knew all of its contents already, but that may be the case.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I economics on a intense mathematical level.
</p></blockquote><p>I'll remind you that in the economics course we took together, our professor sung my praises in class. I still remember the look on your face, lol.</p><p>I have met many trained economists. In fact, some non-trivial portion of philosophers also have backgrounds in economics. Economics and Philosophy are the highest IQ fields in the Humanities.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">H</sup></button> I think I can appreciate the analytic aspects of your discipline. I'm not afraid of mathematics. I enjoy proofs even if I'm not amazing with them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">p</sup></button> You are free to be as intensely mathematical as you'd like with me. I will do my best to understand your argument. Take me down your rabbithole.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>There are two different types of economists in this worlds dreamers and debaters, and mathematicians who utilize empirical evidence of human behavior to establish obvious values to policy and the costs associated with them.
</p></blockquote><p>Why shouldn't I think that is a false dichotomy? Why do you think the mathematicians aren't, in fact, debating (and dreaming) in how they take up particular assumptions, generate proofs, and attempt to reason empirically about the world? </p><p>I worry you are dismissively couching my position as lacking any empirical or mathematical merit. I certainly {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Dream.html">Dream</a>} and debate, but I'm willing to wager I've spent more time analyzing the state of the world and the nature of our minds than you have. Let me fire back here:</p><p>Do you really think you understand the fundamental ethical notion of utilitarianism? This is the basis of the proofs you are going to generate. There are many quagmires here. <em>As someone who ethics on an intense philosophical level</em>, I can guarantee you are in over your head. You will not be able to dismiss my criticisms at this level with much integrity.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pr</sup></button> I will remind you that all disciplines are a subset of philosophy. My discipline is the foundation to yours. Your charity and openness will be worth your time.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Generally most liberals I talk to don't understand how markets work.
</p></blockquote><p>I'm probably not your average liberal (I wouldn't call myself a liberal either though). I can't say I understand how markets work all the way down, but I don't think anyone else does either. It's pretty obvious that Chicago-style macroeconomic models have failed to predict many large events in the past decades.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">adh</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Attempting to explain how rasisng a minimum wage would crate inflation and unemployment...
</p></blockquote><p>Ah. Are you really sure about this? Does that apply unconditionally? Are you sure there aren't counterexamples or empirical evidence of how raising minimum wage might not have these results in all cases? The market is not rational, and more importantly, you will never be able to peel apart politics from economics (or you have already solved the maximin problem if you did). I fear the economics you have learned is actually more theory than practice; these models can sometimes be akin to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spherical chickens in a vacuum in physics</a>. I'm not saying your claim is useless: far from it. I'm simply pointing out that you are moving too quickly and bluffing pockets aces when I know you don't have them.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It has to be explained graphically and generally by this point  a staunch liberal is reminding me of WMDs and war for oil before I can educate.
</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate that you wish to educate. Teach me, sir. I will listen very carefully. I hope you will listen just as carefully. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I also think your admirable desire to help others blinds your from appriciating that economics is not a fixed pie. Everyone can win...It is a common fallacy...Arguably the biggest.
</p></blockquote><p>I think you have hardly taken the time to know my opinion on the matter. You are putting words into my mouth uncharitably. </p><p>There is also clearly a difference between <em>how people play our iterated games</em> and <em>how they possibly can play these games</em>. I can describe the latter as obviously being non-zerosum (and prescribing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>) while still pointing out how the former is often zerosum. </p><p>I think you will find that I am interested in markets built upon <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> principles (even if that may be a contradiction). </p><p>Basically, I think you have bought the biggest fallacy: that egoism is in the best interest of everyone. Power will continue to centralize in Capitalism. If you want to be pragmatic, you're going to have to own up to the fact that we aren't playing a game in a vacuum.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youtu.be/Hrg1CArkuNc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Hrg1CArkuNc</a></p><p>im gonna cop out and let the nobel prize winner help me out here</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLPvfLYnAM0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLPvfLYnAM0</a>
</p></blockquote><p>It's fascinating that you claim to be teaching &quot;them liberals,&quot; but copout when I ask you directly about it. You are being a pansy here. Watch me say: </p><p>Go read a Marxist book (IIRC, I recommended Picketty to you here). Does that really further the dialectic here? If you can't make the argument yourself, I think you should demonstrate far more humility than you do.</p><p>To the first video:</p><ul><li>When the wealthy are taxed at 40%, let me know.</li><li>Even Nozickian's require a minimalist state to prevent &quot;theft,&quot; and that will require taxation; I see lipservice paid here.</li><li>You're gonna need an argument about why governments conceptually (not just our current government) can't possibly engage in any kind of efficient taxation. This isn't it.</li><li>Creativity and innovation have non-trivially come out of public university systems which have been non-trivially paid for through taxation.</li><li>Oh, indeed, our government is wasteful. Your job working for the military industrial complex is a great example.</li><li>Governments can offer significant goods and services to the people. The claim made in this video is farcical.</li><li>I admire his desire to localize and decentralize power.</li></ul><p>This does not address the fallacy to which you were talking about earlier. Your argument isn't being supported by this video.</p><p>The second video:</p><ul><li>If you don't think wealthy is concentrating, you aren't paying attention!</li><li>The game is played as a zerosum game, but that doesn't mean it has to be (as I said before to you). </li><li>Relative wealth is actually quite important to well-being. Wealth inequality will inevitably have political consequences (wake up!). </li><li>Even if it is not zerosum, distribution matters. You must always contend with diminishing marginal utility. The fact is that past ~100k/year of money you've earned (or living off interest of ~$3mil) is about where you don't see much higher utility gains. Maximizing the wealth of the global poor is by far the best way improve global utility. The Rawlsian Maximin principle is clearly correct on utilitarian grounds (which isn't to say Rawls got it all right).  </li></ul><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>In reality, I think very little about economics these days. I'm more concerned with how expensive my health care is and why?
</p></blockquote><p>I'm willing to call that a pragmatic concern with economics. I'm urging you to begin thinking about economics again (and with more humility). Sometimes what we learned in undergrad can be wrong. You learned a very specific school of economics (and I learned specific schools of philosophy in undergrad too).</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">H : </span> The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> to which economics is a science is debatable.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">p : </span> I've a non-trivial background in logic.
