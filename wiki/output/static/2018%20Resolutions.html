There are losing battles and wars in life and those in which we have only a sliver of a chance of winning that we should still fight. I think the world is ending, but I need to step up my fight. I need to create the tools to fight the end of the world and slavery.</p><p>I want to change the world. I've not tried hard enough. I know what my limits are in many ways. I know I don't work well with others, but I have been a mad genius before; I really think I could build something important. I see the shape of things that others do not. I must try to help the world. And, do you know why? Because I fucking hate the world. I need to change its identity. I will coerce it, tame it like the beast it is, give it a proper Kantian civilizing. What else can I do? That's my goal. I'm going to make the world better, and I'm going to do it on my terms. You all have no clue what you are doing, and you need wisdom. This is what magnanimity is supposed to be; that proof generation is not a bad thing, it's useful to us all.</p><p>My time is valuable, but my ray of intentionality is even more valuable. I must control my attention span. I have the tendency to hop from one thing to the next. I have a hard time sticking to anything.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.24-6</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>There is no point being focused, with a finely tuned productivity system, and maniacal discipline against distractions, if you're not sure what you're doing is worth doing.
</p></blockquote><p>A sense of purpose is fundamental to controlling my attention span. I must develop the right habits of channeling myself. I need to have a gameplan and stick to it. My lack of attention span is the result of at least two things:</p><ul><li>Lacking a sense of purpose (even if only in the moment)<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.24-7</sup></button></li><li>Not planning<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.24-8</sup></button><ul><li>I give myself purpose when I plan.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I tend to stick to plans more often as I age. I assume that is not accident. I can give a host of reasons why. Let's do this. It needs to not be pleasurable. It needs to hurt. If I'm not in pain as I do it, I'm not really pushing myself. I need to push myself really hard. I'm wasting my mind when I don't. <em>Leisure</em> time should be spent truly working on myself or those I love. I can't afford to get sucked into something just because it is fun. I need direct my {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Focus.html">Focus</a>} more. </p><p>Thus I want to hyperread and deepread (plus writing) in an office setting. I should find a job I can learn and maintain and then kick back and read while meeting my employer's requirements.</p><h2 class="">Hyperread:<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.24-9</sup></button></h2><p>I want to transform my hyperreading into something extremely efficient. 
Thus, I want to hyperread for:</p><ul><li>News</li><li>Surveying through Editorials</li><li>Curation</li><li>Plunging into a Rabbithole I know is worthwhile.</li></ul><h2 class="">Office Job:</h2><ul><li>It's time to consider doing the office job again. Finding a way to work and play at work to learn more. I need to make money while doing what I'd normally do at home to some extent. I'm in business transactions, and whatever I'm able to do while they still pay me (as long as it itself isn't immoral) is fine with me. That's the socialist's libertarian spike. I need to be able to sit at my computer and read+write while getting paid for it. Even if I only get to do it for an hour + lunch break, that would be worth my time.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.24-10</sup></button></li></ul><h2 class=""><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Outopos.html">Outopos</a>:</h2><p>This is my vision.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.24-11</sup></button></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2018.12.24-1 : </span> Well, I didn't succeed here.
