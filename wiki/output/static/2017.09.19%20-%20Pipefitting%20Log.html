<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I feel much better this morning. I drive with plenty of time. I can see the clipboard plan doesn't share between two vans very well.</p><p>Dave explained what we already knew in the morning meeting: offloading pipe, the scaffold, not getting the torque setting, problems with the flanges, and not being able to dig basically halted out work. It wasn't our fault. I appreciate his acknowledgment. </p><p>Chris-M was assigned to fabricate a drain or something out of stainless. Yay!! We get to do actual fitting!</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>We got all the pipe and fittings over, as well as all the tools and stands.</p><p>I used a real grasshopper for the first time.</p><p>We waited for permits and fire watch. I beveled. Chris-M gave me an example of what he wanted. He is very good at it.</p><p>By lunch, my bevels looked just as good. By the end of the second break, mine looked better. I didn't get to bevel on the level pipe like he did, nor did I have rotations available. </p><p>We did the first fitup. Chris-M said he was going to let me be in charge of our foreman. He stepped in when necessary. This was my first time doing stainless fitup. </p><p>Chris-M has another set of dogs and tools for stainless only. He says he works with it all the time.</p><p>We didn't tack because I would have to fire watch right before and during lunch. John said fuck that to our superintendent. He stood up for me.</p><h2 class="">Lunch!</h2><p>I beveled. They sugared the weld, so we had to take it off. They fitup another one that I had prepared and taped it up right this time.</p><p>I repaired it. Chris-M liked it. John loved my work. Said I did a great job.</p><p>I noticed from the drawings that Chris-M cut a length too short. I gently guided him to that fact. </p><p>We have to make a saddle, not in the plans for the superintendent who has been bird-dogging us all day. Yay! 12 on 12.</p><p>Chris-M cut the layout I made for alignment dogs out of spare stainless angle. That was nice of him.</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>My bevel on the lap of the lap-joint was fucking amazing. Chris-M said it was very good, John said it looked like a machine had done it, and Chris said it was insane. I may never bevel that well again, it was that good.</p><p>John finished the weld. QC made him fix a couple spots. </p><p>I started cutting and polishing the stainless dogs.</p><p>We did the fitup for the second elbow on the &quot;u.&quot; It was a bitch.</p><p>It was a good day.</p></div>
