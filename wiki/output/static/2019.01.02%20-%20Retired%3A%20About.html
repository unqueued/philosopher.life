I believe my current Daseinic identity and epiphenomenal consciousness emerges from a quadricameral distributed computer network built with some fundamental redundancies in a similar way to how modern computers are actually many multi-layered sets of semi-fault-tolerant computers built around and within each other at both hardware and software levels.</p><p>In peeling apart my existence, I recognize that my self-dialectic may actually be the result of several conflicting interpretations of the world. As there seems to be evidence for it in this wiki, I am open to the possibility that one dimension of my self-dialectic occurs between my verbal and quantitative minds. While I have not fully isolated the relationship, this verbal vs. quantitative dichotomy is perhaps most clearly demonstrated in the constructive relationship and interplay between {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>} and {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>}. Furthermore, I posit a dialectic between my Fastminds and Slowminds, as the outputs of each serve as the inputs to the other. They feed and accumulate data for each other, and this presents itself as my attempt to balance cognition and affectation in execution. Lastly, I am convinced my primary self-dialectic occurs roughly between an entity centered in my Quantitative-Fastmind and another centered in my Verbal-Fastmind.</p><p>I call these entities &quot;intuition networks,&quot; which may themselves be particularized minds of sorts, and I am convinced these Fastminds are the hosts of the networks. These intuition networks appear to be more like software than hardware, acting as keys to our plastic reality map. They feed my Slowmind their gutteral input data, and in return, my Slowmind fertilizes, incubates, trains, breeds, and sublates them. Crucially, these intuition networks can sit in conflict with each other, and I believe at least two of mine have been at war for a long time. They are fighting for Fastmind territory.</p><p>I refer to one of my warring intuition networks as the Redpilled Intuition Network (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>). His previous opponent is referred to as the Kantian Intuition Network (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>), but the first year of this wiki made it apparent that KIN was not sufficiently rational. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Redpills.html">Redpills</a> overcame him; rest in peace. KIN left his mark though, his traces are forever imbued in RPIN's wounds, belly, and maps. Fear not, Kantian Idealists, KIN sacrificed himself for a good cause. Of course, there cannot be a dialectic without at least two interlocutors, thus a new steelman challenger-prophet comes, a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Diamonds.html">Diamond</a> in KIN's likeness emerges from the ashes of sublation: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ehyeh.html">ehyeh</a>, praise be unto his name.</p><p>At times, my intuitions can be deeply incompatible with each other: it's why I sometimes feel ripped in half. I believe the cataclysm between <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ehyeh.html">ehyeh</a> is the epicenter of my upcoming existential Seldon crisis-opportunity which I hope to cleanly resolve. I can see the collision between my competing intuition networks; they are the tectonic plates colliding on my reality map. I must find the answer. I must find the antidote. I am in a race with myself to defuse the bomb inside me before I self-destruct. The core of my computer network is crashing, and I have to hack it back together in this space. I must compatibilize them. I must find peace and agreement between them. Hopefully, I will be able to meet myselves halfway in this wiki. I must find the anchors to which both intuition networks can tether. I need to let the collisions between my competing intuition networks happen on the pages of this wiki rather than in myself. I can feel detached from it, at least a smidgen. I need that space to solve the problem. </p><p>Sometimes I feel like RPIN and ehyeh are on my shoulders attempting to persuade me of their points of view. When I can't resolve the conflict, when they don't agree, then I must choose one (or something else entirely). How do I know when each one is actually correct though? I don't know. I have to try to find an answer. It is an awful, weird feeling to be so unable to trust yourself. I must identify and empathize with my persisting identity, then I must empathize with these characters, and maybe help them empathize with each other. If I cannot convince them, then I have to empathize with the need for the conflict in myself. I'm hoping this is how I can heal myself.</p><p>This wiki is a scaffold around myself, an operating room. Paradoxically, I am the operator(s) and operatee(s). Through self-surgery (&quot;scalpel!&quot;), I must unify myself. I must rewrite my lifestory and stitch together who I was and who I will be with someone I can accept and empathize with. Obviously, I am not merely having a casual conversation with myself; I'm engaged in a wrestling match with myself to decide the fate of my identity. I hope to wrestle gently, and if not, then at least cleverly minimize my pain in my miniature autocoup de gr√¢ce.</p><p>I hope that having a long-term conversation with myself will be the real fix. In addition to the standard evolving pages of this wiki (and hopefully myself), there will be a unique dialogue in this wiki. I will have an overt philosophical dialogue between myselves; I will engage in the Platonic tradition by animating my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN the Psychopathic Pragmatist</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ehyeh.html">ehyeh the Ideal Egoist</a> selves as characters.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pt</sup></button> RPIN and ehyeh will engage in a metamodern existential <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Dialectic.html">dialectic</a>. It is a kind of roleplaying with or in myself, a way to offload myselves into a hypothetical social sphere to inspect. RPIN and ehyeh are virtual machines that I'm hosting in this host wiki OS; yes, I help build the environment, tools, file structures, content, but I am the sole debugger and penetration tester. I am ghost-writing for myself as I animate these sentimental puppets embedded in me. At times it helps to be an observer, like when I'm watching a movie or reading a book, and think about these characters from a dissociated standpoint where I learn to empathize with myselves. </p><p>In my self-reflection, I hope to engage in a process of respectful internal adversarialism which will help me logically, rationally, kindly, and empathically resolve my internal conflict. My competing intuition networks must find peace with each other. My mother once told me that one mark of a genius is the ability to simultaneously hold two diametrically opposed ideas; despite the irrationality of a literal interpretation, there seems to be a ring of intuitive truth to the spirit of her claim. Unfortunately, I can't hold on much longer (I'm just not that smart). My only hope is to weld these opposing ideas, the <em>Doxa</em> of <em>doxa</em> and the <em>Doxa</em> of <em>praxis</em>, together inside the crucible of this wiki. I cannot be ideally-ideal, but I must shoot for where the ideally-practical and practically-ideal meet. I just want peace and happiness. Please. So, paradoxically, this is me magnanimously throwing my gauntlet down at everything, including myselves. I'm going to unify myself or die trying. This is the empathization of my internal war for the sake of self-peace. </p><p>I hope that by mirroring my reality map onto this wiki, I will be able to coordinate my opposing intuition networks, find compromises between them, and make them compatible with each other. My goal is to hierarchically re-intregate myself. I must decisively align my many orders of desires and beliefs in a resounding commitment, securing coherentist conformity between them, and wisely synchronizing and unifying them. I'm reprogramming myself. I seek to be an authentic, autonomous, unified, stable, and whole person.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">an</sup></button> I hope this wiki is a reforming, healing, cleansing, therapeutic, reifying, rationalizing, and vindicating existential programming development environment through which I resolve conflicts in myself, clear my vision, discover fitting lifepaths over time, and hopefully find happiness. </p><p>Additionally, I have come to realize how my constantly evolving self-dialectic isn't always a bad a thing. We might say I am A/B Testing myself for rational preferences in some binary reflective equilibrium process. This wiki is the stage of my self-dialectic where I will wrestle with myself, thesis and antithesis, until one concedes to the other or both concede to a third thesis via sublation, synthesizing their views into a transcendent one. Change isn't always bad. I can feel myself slowly, deliberately, intentionally, oscillating closer to the truth (being less wrong) each day. I'm growing pronoiac about the collection of non-conscious processes of my brain. I have finally come to agree to the pragmatic metamodern commandment: reconstruction must proceed deconstruction. This metamodern <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Axioms%2520of%2520h0p3.html">axiom</a> automagically generates a light for me at the end of the self-dialectic tunnel.

I h0p3 this wiki torrentially develops into a rabbithole, 
    a grounds of imaginative memory for me to explore, adapt, and evolve,
    a tryhard-effortpost self-synecdoche wherein I accurately mean what I say and say what I mean,
    a nexus to cannibalize myself,
    an unstable container for isolating meaningful meaning and quarantining existential contagion.

I h0p3 this self-dialectic blooms into:
    personal zeitgeist and prophesy,
    quotable insight porn,
    originally unoriginal footnote paradise, 
    immortal easter egg city, 
    memetic wonderland lagniappe, 
    a bizarre thought bazaar,
    and genuine existential art.

I h0p3 to become an avant-garde artist-philosopher who has created a fractal, prolix, 4-dimensional timelapse artwork,
    to birth a tour de force hysterical realist's encyclopedic autobiographical perpetual-motion machine to rule them all,
    to exhaustively oversculpt my frenzied 4DID self-portrait with a brute-forcer's word-machinegun, 
        manically painting my reality from my reality as realistically as I can,
        paranoically insisting on my lively interconnectedness, 
        utterly committed to the reality of lacking and being lost,
    to celebrate complexity, reduction, emergence, dialectics, the parts which comprise me, and the wholes to which I contribute,
    and to truly live in my rhizomatic Yggdrasil art.

I h0p3 I can &quot;get it out of me,&quot; extract my essence, and bare my soul to myself here,
    May this be a hospitable place to get to know me, 
    a home in which to plagiarize my experience and upload my mind,
    where I make the most of myself,
    even if only for me to accept my memetically alien self.
    Thus, I h0p3 this is the good, right, and beautiful life-affirming digital twin of a horcrux-pensieve (/copy), 
        to have my heart, mind, and soul walk outside my body onto these pages.

I h0p3 to grab my life by the balls,
    to become an effective risk-taker,
    to think like a good countercultural contrarian irwartfrr,
    to be my own muse,
    to serve it up to myself and the world,
    and to drop the keyboard-mic of this wiki like a boss at the end of my life. 

I h0p3 to vengefully roar from the motionless sound of silence,
    to style on everything in the dialectic with a magical rainbow whoosh,
    to be the victorious sublator,
    even though I can't by a definition which transcends me, so...

I h0p3 to pursue pragmatic perfectionism instead of asking too much of myself and others,
    to manage my expectations (ought) and predictions (is),
    and to compete with only myself and never others in my pursuit of virtue and eudaimonia.
    Thus, I h0p3 to worry only about what is in my control.

I h0p3 to mediate, reconcile, and communicate with myself in:
    open, curious, charitable, and humble self-reflection.

I h0p3 this is a place to explicitly see my reality map in words,
    wisely using my mirror for self-surgery rather than self-admiring,
    because I need to declusterfuck my life's imbroglio.

I h0p3 to move from unconscious incompetence concerning my life to conscious incompetence (get woke), 
    to conscious competence (hard fucking work, habitual grind), 
    to unconscious competence (self-mastery).
    Thus, I h0p3 to be justified in gutchecking and living in the ready-to-hand mode.

I h0p3 to learn to get in the &quot;flow&quot; concentration state while writing this wiki, 
    wherein I lose my sense of time, myself (in a way), and irrelevant problems in order to:
    achieve making my present-at-hand mode feel ready-to-hand, 
    especially about the most fundamental contents of existential thinking.

I h0p3 to ambitiously virtue signal to myself, 
    baroquely decorate, furnish, and entool this mind-palace with dramatic flair, 
    produce a mind for myself that I love living in,
    and continuously make fundamental commitments to my persistent identity.

I h0p3 to chase threads of genius, 
    navigate the strands between insane brilliance and brilliant insanity, 
    and weave something profoundly meaningful and eminently useful to me with them.

I h0p3 to harness my bursts of insight, 
    continue to define my problem space with iteratively-improved heuristics, 
    repeatedly re-invent myself, 
    and plan a streamline grind through life and cognitive dissonance in this existential laboratory.

I h0p3 to be a jedi metagamer of my life, 
    to be practically &quot;meta&quot; about my existence, 
    to play the game of life like a video game I'm obsessed with.
    Thus, I h0p3 to define the game I am playing for myself. 
    I don't know what it is, so how I can I win at it?

I h0p3 this wiki is a Living Metaliving Document,
    one which metamorphoses into a text-based object-oriented cyborg,
    a digital shadow which wrestles with me.
    Perhaps one day I will communicate myself to AI, 
        and perhaps speak with an AI-adapted version of myself derived from this wiki corpus.

I h0p3 composing this wiki is the wisest method of laying the foundation for my magnum opus: 
    attempting to virtuously attempt to virtuously conduct my life,
    ad infinitum.

I h0p3 to learn my lessons,
    and if not that, may you learn from my lack thereof.

I h0p3 to build a memetic treasure trove for my loved ones,
    to construct a life which makes my family happy.
    I must be a penpal to [[Humanity]] and [[myself|h0p3]].
    I want to study myself so [[irwartfrr]] it merits the study of [[others]].

I h0p3 I seek primarily my own approval, 
    and when I seek the approval of others, 
    I h0p3 it is done irwartfrr.
    In particular, I seek the approval of the metamodern strains of my idols and perhaps some future AI.

I h0p3 to channel these gods of philosophers, 
    to be their reincarnated philosophical gladiator. 
    Thus, I h0p3 if I were on trial for being a systematic philosopher, 
    this wikified testimony would be sufficient evidence to convict me.

I h0p3 this is a proof to myself that sacrificing for integrity and self-honesty,
    in particular, enduring the pain of learning to become wiser,
    is worth my time.

I h0p3 to wisely wield myself,
    to transform myself into a Eudaimonic Lifehacker.

I hope I am h0p3.</code></pre><hr><h2 class="">Vault:</h2><ul><li>???WTF???<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Portals.html">Portals</a></li></ul></li><li>Previous {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>} Content Extracted into Other Directories and Pages:<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hlexicon.html">hlexicon</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Help%253A%2520On%2520This%2520Wiki.html">Help: On This Wiki</a></li></ul></li><li>Retired {About}<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.09.30%2520-%2520Retired%253A%2520About.html">2017.09.30 - Retired: About</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Dreams:</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="About%253A%2520%252Fb%252F.html">About: /b/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110382/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110382/</a></li><li>weaponized autism</li><li>self-wormholing rabbithole-self</li><li>Only by describing something can I effectively change it (even if not directly).

As far as the standard use of the word goes, I think the blogs in this wiki do not comprise the most important aspects of it. Of course, I'm willing to call the entire sequences of changes in this wiki, the changelog captured in my snapshots, a log in itself. There is a narrative to it. That is a log on the web (thus blog), by the most literal definition, but somehow I feel it doesn't capture the depth of my work here.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">dc : </span> That sounds ridiculously narcissistic. I really don't mean it that way. Unfortunately, personal journals have to be egocentric in a way, but that doesn't necessarily make them narcissistic tools. My statement is an aspiration, not a claim that I've achieved anything worth reading. I'm well aware of the fact that writing an autobiography borders on outrageous lunacy. I hope to steer away from that <em>icky</em>, ludicrous lack of humility. I must say it up front: of course, I run the risk of going off the deep end here. At the very least, I don't want this wiki to be a: foolish manifesto, rambling vanity trap, blogviating blogwaggoned blogorrhoea, public masturbation session, ode of 'How Great Thou Art' to myself, absurd pile of emo-bullshit, posturing diatribe, fancy agitprop, manipulative virtue-signal, popularity contestant, newage holytext, self-defeating piece of self-help, mere language game, delusional confabulation, useless maze, descent into madness, piece of FUD, or a tool used for evil things. But, ultimately, I need to take my life seriously at some level. Unfortunately, because I'm a 'quirky' (or insane) mama-jama, I desperately want a very low-level, detailed, highly structured, hierarchical understanding of life and myself, from the ground up. So, I'm not here to convince anyone but myself, but I also don't think I'm doing anything morally wrong by taking my life so seriously.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">ml : </span> I fear I can never be skeptical and curious enough.

It's a highly extensible, customizable, absurdly usable, self-reflexive, self-editing Javascript, HTML, CSS platform contained in a single file. It makes object-oriented thinking about any topic easy. It's a recursive outlining tool. It's a high signal-to-noise ratio briccolage of graduated chinese information boxes. It enables contortionistically efficient reuse and refactoring of information. This is what hypertext was meant to be; it puts the <em>soft</em> back in software.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">ba : </span> I'm a badass, right? Lol.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">ee : </span> I am not a Heidegger scholar. I am fascinated by what he is doing though. To be as precise as I can (with the caveat of my poor and corrupted understanding of Heidegger), I see this wiki as a unique kind of equipment that serves as a portal between ready-to-hand and present-at-hand modes for me, i.e. a RtH-PaH-portal. Some things jerk us out of the ready-to-hand into the present-at-hand mode (and some the other direction, and perhaps some in both directions). Not all RtH-PaH-portals have the same destinations (there may be many different instances, aspects, or points of view one can 'arrive at' in either mode). I suspect what things count as portals (and the function-rules which map their destinations) are different for everyone, but there may also be natural portal patterns that arise in a species of creatures with very similar brain structures. In any case, some of those portals bring us into a present-at-hand mode in which Dasein is thinking about thinking and thinking about existence. This wiki is one of those more existentially focused/destined  RtH-PaH-portals which I'm desperately hoping to leverage. I must heighten my self-awareness like Goku with his martial art (/cringe). I need equipment for bringing me into a scientifically (because we can't get Husserl's core: certainty) philosophical mindset about my existence. I need equipment when I arrive at that destination to do my work in there. There is a ready-to-handedness (RtHness) I'm trying to cultivate in my present-at-handedness (PaHness) towards my existence. I need to make it easier to be self-reflective and existential, to the point that it is a reflex. I need to be a master of it (10,000 hours, they say) to the point that it becomes unproblematic, fundamental, ingrained, and the natural way of doing it for me. I need that RtHness, being 'in the zone,' while I'm being existential. I hope this wiki is that special equipment, acting as an existential portal for me.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">pl : </span> There are limits to my plasticity and what I can achieve.

Additionally, I sometimes pretend I was A.I. teaching itself, constructing itself. What rules, methods, approaches, etc. should I use?'

However, it became clear to me that part of my deep conflict with them is also a deep conflict within myself. This wiki could and should be much more than a letter to my parents.
