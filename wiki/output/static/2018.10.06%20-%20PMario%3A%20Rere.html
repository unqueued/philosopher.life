<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Hey Mario,</p><blockquote><p>I've seen your discussion about tagging in the group, but I didn't follow it till the end. ... I personally think, that your system with: YYYY.MM.DD - FooTag: BarTitle is a very good approach. I like it.</p></blockquote><p>Thank you. I was glad to have the opportunity to receive advice and theory in that thread. I too am convinced the naming convention is useful enough that I should aim to use tagging to achieve that which the naming convention cannot (though, perhaps I will also have redundancy too).</p><blockquote><p>I think, you shouldn't change your system. Just add some tagging, so tags will complement your &quot;battle tested&quot; existing system. So some of your &quot;hard-coded&quot; lists can be transferred to dynamic lists over time. ....</p></blockquote><p>Agreed. I'm going to slowly work my way towards it. Perhaps I want to have my cake and eat it too here. I wish I could dynamically generate the hardcoded lists given some set of conditions. One of my worries is that References (which I find immensely valuable for this maze of a wiki) are only generatable (or should only be generated) by hardcoded links (if I tried to start stacking dynamic list generation inside each other [which I assume has a number of issues], this wiki could get really slow really fast).</p><blockquote><p>The problem with dynamic lists and many tiddlers is performance. If a list is created, the core has to touch every tiddler... So your existing approach may be much more performant.</p></blockquote><p>6400 in two years. It might be the case that a decade from now I'll be looking at 30-40k tiddlers. I have my doubts that this process will become multiple-threaded in the browser, and I'm not convinced single-threaded performance is going to see major gains either. </p><p>Hardcoded links allow for almost complete non-evaluative static rendering of this wiki, and it has platform agnostic properties that I like as well. Hardcode makes it a bit easier to parse TWcode into some markup and convert links correctly to emerge out of the TW platform with my structure somewhat intact. But, I think TW is going to be my tool of choice for a very long time to come (I'm having a hard time conceiving of a replacement).</p><blockquote><p>Do you want to use the &quot;linking&quot; or the &quot;aliasing&quot; feature?</p></blockquote><p>I'm sorry that I'm ignorant about this question. I believe aliasing is what matters to me. The &quot;Darwinism&quot; example is what I'm hoping to implement. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><blockquote><p>* I have too many tiddlers (~6400 right now)</p></blockquote><p>Yea, that may be the problem. ... Uni-link adds some macros, that will have some overhead if you have many tiddlers. I'll need to test it, with your TW
</p></blockquote><p>I would greatly appreciate any help you are willing to provide. I have no idea what to do or where to begin. Your tool seems like the only correct option here, and I'm a little surprised (and I don't mean to sound entitled at all) that your plugin isn't actually a native function of Tiddlywiki. It seems like it would be a super common and useful thing, but I may not understand the implications of what you've built well enough or TW in general.
 
&lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt;    * There is a problem(s) tiddler which is causing this. I have no idea what to look for though.</p><p>I don't think so. It may be a mixture of different things.
&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>Roger that.</p><blockquote><p>Can you describe a bit closer, what you want to do with the uni-link plugin? So I can try to create a test case, and do some &quot;live-debugging&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Basically, I want to be able to use an arbitrary number of initial names to functionally resolve to a single tiddler with a final name (I want the world!). </p><p>My current awful noob hack (which is stupidly ugly) is to have multiple tiddlers which transclude the final one, but I would much rather not create a dozen tiddlers to point to just one, and I'd strongly prefer that all of them resolve to the same name.</p><p>Unfortunately, I also desperately want to keep References working. I'm completely restructuring the wiki, and thinking about where everything belongs and what its connected to is crucial spidering around and organizing it. I need to continue connecting the dots with reference, but I definitely want the naming superpowers that Unilink enables.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>h0p3</p></div>
