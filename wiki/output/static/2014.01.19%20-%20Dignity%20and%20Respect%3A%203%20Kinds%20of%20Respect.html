Maybe he doesn't draw the lines exactly as they should be drawn, but he is moving in the right direction. I'm not thrilled with his specific definitions and examples. Some of the moves he makes are either unclear or baffling to me, but I think the overall terminology remains useful (I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we continued to use it throughout the semester). Some thoughts:</p><p>Freedom and Responsibility</p><p>I wonder if recognition respect is the kind of thing over which we have some control and appraisal respect isn‚Äôt. Moral recognition respect in particular seems to be the real goal we are after in this class, while appraisal respect doesn‚Äôt seem directly morally relevant. From a kind of doxastic involuntarism perspective, appraisal seems akin to an evaluation and belief formation concerning how particular tokens matchup to the standard of the good of its type.

What is this appraisal? It is just comparing the object to the standard of the good of its kind. Does the object flourish as a specimen of its kind? Virtue excellence is key to eudaimonia (in itself a kind of excellence as a specimen), but it takes a lot more to being a good, eudaimonic human specimen than being virtuous. Yes, appraisal respect of persons should focus most upon moral attributes, but I don't see why it should only be about moral attributes. Appraisal can evaluate a specimen‚Äôs degree of eudaimonia, not just the sub-component of virtue.</p><p>The whole point of the distinguishing recognition from appraisal was to get us closer to what we really mean by respecting persons, treating them as ends, and so forth. There was no need to narrow appraisal respect like he did. Why does appraisal respect have to be about a person? Why can't it be about other kinds of objects? Why isn't there simply a subset of broad appraisal respect which deals with persons in particular?

Stanford Pre-reading
--------------

&quot;Recognition respect is the disposition to give appropriate weight or consideration in one's practical deliberations to some fact about the object and to regulate one's conduct by constraints derived from that fact.&quot;

Why not regulate one's attitudes, intentions, and dispositions over which one has control?

Recognition respect seems (or needs to be) the kind of respect over which we have some control. It likely needs to be a choice.

Appraisal respect seems to be something over which we haven't much choice. In a doxastic involuntarism perspective, this appraisal is just an evaluation and belief formation that coincides with our beliefs about the good of things, and how particular instances of those things matchup to the standard of the good of its kind. 

Recognition respect may not obviously involve valuing the object itself. Appraisal doesn't have this &quot;valuing the object itself&quot; either.

Darwall
--------------

He's hit on something important in this distinction. Maybe he doesn't draw the lines exactly as they should be drawn, but he is moving the right direction. I'm not thrilled with his specific definitions and examples.

&quot;To say that persons as such are entitled to respect is to say that they are entitled to have other persons take seriously and weigh appropriately the fact that they are persons in deliberating about what to do.&quot; (38)

This seems too weak. 

Darwall demarcates recognition respect and moral obligation very clearly. Recognition respect seems to bring about moral obligation. I don't understand. 

I worry that a notion of appraisal respect is at the beginnings of Recognition Respect.


The object of recognition respect is a fact (39)...this seems odd. My intuition (I find the pull of moral realism to be incredibly strong) is that this isn't really the kind of respect for a person that I mean. The object of respect should be the person, not the fact of their personhood. He does go on to say that &quot;to respect something in this way is just to regard it as something to be reckoned with (in the appropriate way) and to act accordingly. Maybe I am quibbling over nothing.

The fact is that persons have dignity. Recognizing that fact is perhaps like appraisal.

I worry that the kind of respect we are going after is the same thing as just being moral. Darwall obviously thinks we ought to respect persons. But, to say that we ought to respect others is just to say we ought to do/intend what we ought to do/intend towards others. 


moral recognition respect is a subset - of course, I'm not sure what we really mean by 'appropriate' with any bite if it isn't moral required. 

MRR is a kind of attitude. 

I know you rail against the fact-finding mission, the diamond-based value theory. This seems to be an intuition which so many people have (or would have if they thought about it). We need an account of that intuition (at least for those of us who take intuitions to be valid epistemological starting places and standards), and why so many people could be wrong. I feel like there is a virtue-theoretic approach to solve this problem, but why resort to solving something which my intuitions say isn't a problem in the first place? At some point, we do get to help ourselves to certain foundational assumptions. There are varying degrees of epistemic requirements, and some people (a skeptic) has a very high requirement, and others simply don't have the same requirements. 


Darwall calims that &quot;There are attitudes similar ot moral recognition respect, and referred to as respect, but which differ importantly. A boxer talks of having respect for his opponent's left hoook and an adventurer of respecting the rapids of the Colorado. Neither regards the range of morally permissible actions as restricted by the things in question.&quot;

Does he mean that neither 'should' regard or more as a matter of empirical fact that neither does regard? From my perspective, many empirical facts about world, including those two things which are respected, could play into restricted the range of morally permissible actions. 

His virtue talk struck me as odd. Perhaps I've totally misunderstood him (and if so, then the rest of what I have to say is gibberish). If I understood him correctly, he has unnecessarily narrowed the concept of appraisal respect. Darwall seems to want to do away with the non-agengy features altogether as being capable of being the object of appraisal respect though. That can't be right. I agree that someone's character and choices and agency-related features are more important than their natural, non-agental features, but that doens't mean non-agency features can't be appraised. What is this appraisal? It is just comparing the object to the standard of the good of its kind. Does the object flourish as a specimen of its kind? Excellence of disposition is key to excellence of being human, but it takes a lot more to being a good human specimen than the right moral attributes. Yes, appraisal respect of persons should focus most upon moral attributes, but I don't see why it should only be about moral attributes. 

The whole point of the distinguishing recognition from appraisal was to get us closer to what we really mean by respecting persons, treating them as ends, and so forth. There was no need to narrow appraisal respect like he did. 

Why does appraisal respect have to be about a person? Why can't it be about other kinds of objects? Why isn't there simply a subset of broad appraisal respect which deals with persons in particular? Appraisal respect just doesn't matter very much, so why does he focus so much on it?



The funny part is that I think recognition respect of persons has an egalitarian perspective (somewhat like Kant's notion), where no person is better than any other person, and all people must be treated as (with the right motivation) as ends in themselves. There might be other layers of recognition respect that are quite important. Is it irrational to respect my parents more than other parents just because they are mine? 

I fail to see how moral recognition respect just isn't the same as being moral.

Insofar as morality admits of degrees (if at all), moral recognition respect seems to as well. 

On 46, he claims that &quot;in having recognition respect for a person as such as we are not appraising him or her as a person at all. Rather we are judging that the fact that he or she is a person places moral constraints on our behavior.&quot; Why? It seems to be that you can only make such a judgment if you hold persons in esteem, and appraising the object in question as being a person (as being better than the rock by some general standard of the good).
