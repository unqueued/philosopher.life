I know I am at least an ego tunnel: a prerequisite-X-factor-development-spectrum-cluster-stage homo sapien from which Dasein emerges that models for itself the experience of the Being of Becoming. I am that long ‚â•4-dimensional tunnel creature with consciousness, a constituent expression of evolution and our universe, that extends down the paths of the branches of the tree of possible worlds.

I hope this <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Root.html">Root</a>ed directory serves as a historical foundation for explaining and justifying myself to myself. This is my story.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button> Here are the records and contexts of my lifelong practice of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Art%2520of%2520Living.html">Art of Living</a>, and I hope it will be my masterpiece.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> I hope {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Vault.html">Vault</a>} eventually tells the story of a life, my life, that I would joyfully elect to live again and again into eternity if given the chance.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button> I hope this directory will be my life's magnum opus; one's life should be one's life's work; your life is your greatest project, by definition. </p><p>Here I archive and piece together those narratives of mine which make me proud, nostalgic, or pensive for the sake of my future-self. {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Vault.html">Vault</a>} is a sequence of memoirs, projects, and shifts in my perspectives, values, and goals. It gives me a chance to reflect upon seasons, eras, arcs, and chapters of my life. I hope for this directory to eventually evolve into a trophy vault and a place for me to celebrate my hard work.</p><p>Eventually my work from {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About%252C%2520a.k.a.%2520The%2520Opening%2520of%2520the%2520Rabbit%2520Hole.html">About</a>}, {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Principles%2520of%2520Programming%2520Myself.html">Principles</a>}, and {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Current%2520Focus%2520of%2520h0p3's%2520Wiki.html">Focus</a>} will migrate into this vault.  Retiring my work allows me to set it aside, to distance myself from it, to reflect on it in a different way, and sometimes to celebrate it.</p><p>I lived for 31 years before I started writing this wiki. I've precious little writing from or about that time period. There are gaps in my narrative which I must fill.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button> This is a place to define my past. I need to reflect on my entire narrative, to connect the dots for myself, and to find the patterns which emerge. Thinking about &quot;<em>who I was</em>&quot; is part of satisfying that fundamental maxim: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Know%2520Thyself.html">Know Thyself</a>.</p><p>One worry I have is that this is a rationalization-facility or a refuse bin rather than a tool for building the morally justified story of who I was. In my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> modeling of my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a> to myself, I'm going to have to be reductive, and I want to make sure I do so with moral integrity. I must always doubt myself in this respect. It is easy to be conveniently wrong to my selfish ends, and I must be ever vigilante against the hedonic desires and passions which seek to heterodoxically enslave my Reason. Oh, that doesn't mean I aim to be ascetic, but I remember that when push comes to shove (and I can't have both), I have a habit of viciously pursuing the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Beautiful.html">The Beautiful</a> rather than <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> in my pursuit of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>. Justice is incredibly expensive here because it's so tempting to tell myself the story of myself in an all too delusionally flattering and selfishly convenient confabulation. I must prevent myself from sliding into painting myself the hero of my self-authored story. I hope I have the balls to face my regrets. Indeed, I will need all the courage, honesty, and luck I can muster to avoid the being evilly integrated self-constitution trap.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">e</sup></button> </p><p>Admittedly, I spend almost no time developing this space, except for searching. Perhaps the dead shall bury the dead. It doesn't have to be a barren wasteland though. I hope to be motivated build and use a serious catalog and to wisely amortize my self-reflection. Lastly, I hope to provide myself perspective on <em>who I was</em> for the sake of both knowing <em>who I am</em> and planning <em>who I will be</em>. Thus, I hope to have a prolific and unabridged life of happiness.</p><hr><h2 class="">Principles:</h2><ul><li>Graft work from the rest of this wiki into this {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Vault.html">Vault</a>}</li><li>Reconstruct accurate narratives and timelines as best you can while accepting your fallibility.</li><li>Explore who you were and what your life was like.</li><li>For now, divide your life into geographically-based timeline chunks.</li><li>Figure out ways to tell yourself your story better, more efficiently, with clarity, and more coherently.</li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Focus:</h2><ul><li>1985-1989 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Chicago.html">Chicago</a></li><li>1989-1991 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Louisville.html">Louisville</a></li><li>1991-1992 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New%2520Haven.html">New Haven</a></li><li>1992-1997 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Mannsville.html">Mannsville</a></li><li>1997-1998 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Red%2520House%2520%252B%2520Wilmore.html">Red House + Wilmore</a></li><li>1998-2003 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Elizabethtown.html">Elizabethtown</a></li><li>2003-2005 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Berea.html">Berea</a></li><li>2005-2008 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Elizabethtown%2520Redeux.html">Elizabethtown Redeux</a></li><li>2008-2010 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Thailand.html">Thailand</a></li><li>2010-2012 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Baton%2520Rouge.html">Baton Rouge</a></li><li>2012-2016 - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New%2520Orleans.html">New Orleans</a></li><li>2016-20?? - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Johnson%2520City.html">Johnson City</a></li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Vault:</h2><ul><li>Retired <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Root.html">Root</a>:<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.09.16%2520-%2520Retired%253A%2520Home.html">2017.09.16 - Retired: Home</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.11.02%2520-%2520Retired%253A%2520Home.html">2017.11.02 - Retired: Home</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2019.01.02%2520-%2520Retired%253A%2520Root.html">2019.01.02 - Retired: Root</a></li></ul></li><li>Retired {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Vault.html">Vault</a>}:<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.09.10%2520-%2520Retired%253A%2520Vault.html">2017.09.10 - Retired: Vault</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Dreams:</h2><ul><li>Setup {Vault} with an automated script walking through my timeline on this wiki!</li><li>I could use a more dynamic timeline tool.
