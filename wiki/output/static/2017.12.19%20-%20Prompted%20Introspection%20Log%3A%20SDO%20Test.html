<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>SDO Q&amp;A with argumentation</em></p><h2 class="">1. An ideal society requires some groups to be on top and others to be on the bottom.</h2><p>You ask a nebulous question. Prepare for me to take you to task for it.</p><p>What is a group of people? I assume you mean this as a class of some spectrum of things they share in common. It could be morally arbitrary or even fundamentally moral. I take it, that for example, the group of pokemon players is a group, as is the group of Asian-Americans, etc. Groups of those virtuous (to some threshold) agents at a particular practice, people with exactly 1,549 hairs on their body, and the Erdos numbers applied to academics form groups. </p><p>If you think I'm going to roll over and say races, ethnicities, nationalities, genders, sexes, ages, etc. are the only groups, you are sorely mistaken Samwise Gamgee. Pay attention to your fucking question.</p><p>What does it mean to be &quot;on top&quot; of another group? Do you mean they have powers over them? Do you mean they are simply better at yoyoing than the other group? Do you mean they have more instrumental value, or intrinsic value, or something else than the other group? What is your standard here? I'm going to assume power, since this test is about dominance. There are, of course, many kinds and degrees of power. </p><p>Is it a good thing that I do not let my baby crawl into the street? Good for whom? I think the answer is good for anyone that matters in the equation, and thus the answer is, yes. This is a power over someone else that is worth while. There is Virtue spectrum to being Patronizing, to being a Steward, and to many other kinds of power structures which actually justify one group being &quot;on top&quot; of another group.</p><p>Just as importantly, what do you mean by &quot;ideal society?&quot; How far are you willing to let me go into the ideal? I see far more possibilities than you do. Do you just mean practically ideal in an immediate sense? I'm pretty sure you do. Let's give you that heuristic. </p><p>Alright, I legitimately think that those who perform philosophy well at theoretic and practical levels should be &quot;on top&quot; in the ideal society. Plato was very partially and somewhat roughly correct in model of city and the philosopher king. We can all agree that ideally, the wisest and most virtuous of humanity and statesmanship should be guiding those &quot;beneath&quot; her. Ideally, our philosopher queen or king would already know how to structure society and their advisors (and everything else). That's the ideal. </p><p>Don't you see? Our ability to imagine <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> has a profound influence on what we take to be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> at this fundamental level in plausible metaethical theory I've found. What you call <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, be it utility, virtue, the Good Will itself and Autonomy, or whatever...that's the only way to even have value that moves us to act in the first place. It is our plight to have the relationship. Perhaps <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> are themselves the model of a kind of eternal dialectic, a metaethical dialectic in cross-defining each other, a very weird kind of conceptual relationship.</p><p>Thus, I must strongly agree to the claim of the prompt. It is not what you meant, I bet. But, it cannot be escaped. You will fail to offer any serious conceptual analysis. </p><h2 class="">2. Some groups of people are simply inferior to others.</h2><p>Obviously, given my previous argument, the answer is yes. There are many kinds of groups as well as inferiority. This claim is activated in many contexts of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>.</p><p>If you think this question is specifically about respecting the dignity inherent in all persons, then just say it. That kind of dignity, may very well be equal (you aren't in a position to know either way, I worry). Ultimately, you will not escape the &quot;all else being equal, considering only this non-dignity variable, being this person is better than being that person&quot; (and 'better for' doesn't stop me from being right). </p><p>You know what really fucking annoys me about these questions, I think you want to conflate the description of social dominance theory with the prescription accepted by psychopaths.</p><h2 class="">3. No one group should dominate in society.</h2><p>Are we back to question (1)? What do you mean by &quot;should&quot; here? You have <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> in mind, but how idealized is this? This question is different since it seems to pertain to the state of affairs that obtain rather than an &quot;ideal society.&quot;  </p><p>Also, what do you mean by dominate? Can you have power over someone without dominating? To what extent, and why should we draw the lines like you think?</p><p>We are still in prescriptive territory here. And, frankly, it's too general. You should have asked if I thought it was acceptable for those currently in power to dominate society. You didn't though.</p><p>For now, it seems cogent to continue this trend, to answer &quot;no&quot; to this question.</p><h2 class="">4. Groups at the bottom are just as deserving as groups at the top.</h2><p>Ah, thank Seldon you are moving towards more reasonable questions (although, this has its problems). You mean, given the current description of the world, do I think those at the bottom of the ladder of chaos, the disenfranchised by and large (although, I'm open to exceptions), are as deserving as those at the top of the ladder? Tell me what deserving means. </p><p>Deserving of being in the position they are currently in? Or, do you mean do they deserve to be treated differently? I'm going with the latter interpretation.</p><p>It seems obvious to me that both groups deserve the same opportunities. Please engage your Original Position model, go behind the Veil of Ignorance, and find justice. Wield that Kantian Ring of Gyges wisely.  Don't you see? The world is wildly unjust, particularly to the poor. They deserve much better. </p><p>Finally, I get to not sound like an asshole. And, yet, I warn you, my position is still quite coherent. Your questions suck; they are so bad, I'm worried they are designed to force us not to even question these fundamental issues but instead to conflate and confuse them.</p><h2 class="">5. Group equality should not be our primary goal.</h2><p>Define equality. Do we only get one primary goal? Why is this about group equality, and why not just think about individuals? After all, every individual forms their own unique group. </p><p>It seems obvious that we can't reach such a goal in every possible way. There is moral luck to be had that cannot be stopped. Some people, for example, simply win the genetic lottery. That said, we should absolutely build basic structures in society so as to maximin. We must decentralize power. Power inequalities are incredibly dangerous, as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>That said, you said the magic word &quot;should.&quot; Tell me again, how idealized do you want to go? I see a possible world in which the philosopher king's society obtains. I think it is incredibly unlikely. I think the risk assessment should point us to triage into other positions. Pragmatism in this case is about making sure psychopaths are prevented from ruling us. </p><p>That, of course, is a classic Kantian conundrum. Will you call the psychopath a person? They are not reasonable by your definition of Reason (autonomy, CI-users, etc.). So close, and yet so useless at times.</p><p>Thus, I knot myself into incoherence in trying to evaluate this question. I cannot answer it. My gut instinct is to say, yes. If by equality we mean the &quot;instruments of happiness,&quot; which clearly have diminishing marginal returns, then I say, yes! If this is about happiness directly, then I'm worried about utility monsters and the cornercases which prevent me from being able to say &quot;yes.&quot; However, I very much like the maximin principle. I think it embodies what you really mean to say in egalitarian thought, since that is Justice Behind the Veil.</p><h2 class="">6. It is unjust to try to make groups equal.</h2><p>I've discussed this problem already. Dominance is still going to exist in societies seeking equality. Don't you see they aren't mutually exclusive in practical and ideal possible worlds? Ugh. You can basically make this question mean whichever side you want it to mean. It is embedded with too many dichotomous ambiguities.</p><p>I suppose I must say no. That's just my gut instinct on the question, at this point. That's what the words &quot;mean to me&quot; when you back me into a corner and I have to give you a gutteral response. I just tend to disagree with those who say this phrase virtually 100% of the time. </p><h2 class="">7. We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups.</h2><p>Just repeating yourself. Yes, if we take my interpretation of equalizing (which, you should, you just don't realize it in this question). </p><p><em>Conditions</em> here is odd. What makes someone happy varies from person to person. There are a set of interpretations here that will make your question say what you intend it to say. This is not well phrased though.</p><h2 class="">8. We should work to give all groups an equal chance to succeed.</h2><p>Succeed at what? I don't want to give psychopaths the chance to succeed to being psychopathic. I don't want to give Hitler the chance to succeed in his holocaust. Of course, I probably can guess what you mean by this, and I hate to tell you, I probably disagree with what counts as success. In metaethics, I hold a moral perfectionist stance. My laundry list of the human good is extensive (albeit flexible enough to handle the usual worries). Again, success by what standard?</p><p>This is still too slippery a question. It's bad, and you should feel bad, Sam. </p><p>Fine, fuck it. I'm going to say &quot;of course&quot; we should seek equal chances of achieving eudaimonia or something like that. You are making me put words in your mouth, you know that, right?</p><h2 class="">Result:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>High</p><p>Your answers correspond to a high social dominance orientation, suggesting that you prefer relations between different social groups to be more hierarchical and less equal. For members of high-status groups, high SDO is strongly correlated with conservative political views.
</p></blockquote><p>In a way, yes. But, I do not hold some barbaric view. Correlation is a nice hedge here, and let me say, you're pigeon-holing. I think there is kind of memetic SDO embedded in these very questions, in seeking out the people you dislike. Yet, you strawman. You dumb idiot. =)
