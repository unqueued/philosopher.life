Tue 2:18 PM
 You doing okay?
Wed 11:59 AM
 Yes and no I will make it work but last weekend was a struggle and my car broke down. And just not was able to get it into the shop.
Wed 12:07 PM
 =(
Wed 12:07 PM
 How are you getting to work?
Wed 12:08 PM
 Lyft
Wed 12:07 PM
 God damn, that is expensive
Wed 12:08 PM
 I'm sorry =(
Wed 12:08 PM
 I‚Äôm still working on your letter I know it‚Äôs been more than a few days but I‚Äôm still editing. Iv been struggling with it. Talk to my therapist about it
Wed 12:12 PM
 Hey, don't feel too much pressure about it, please. I very much appreciate how much work you are putting into it. I don't want it to be a burden either.
Wed 12:14 PM
 There's a way in which it can be a good thing to struggle with it, but only if it is constructive for you.
Wed 12:14 PM
 If it helps, my polling of my trusted advisors is almost complete. You, [[L]], and [[ALM]] are the last. Unless you all present some novel arguments, it seems the will of my advisers is not to connect with ?[[MWF]]? and [[SLT]] because it will endanger me legally and psychologically.
Wed 12:16 PM
 Your vote does matter! What you think is extremely important to me.
Wed 12:16 PM
 [[AA]] is writing back, btw. It sounds like she was far more open to my letter than I anticipated.
Wed 12:17 PM
 Please take as long as you want on the letter you are writing. There is no rush.
Wed 12:18 PM
 I hope therapy is going well for you.
Wed 12:18 PM
 I'm sure it has been extremely difficult, on top of the car and life in general.
Wed 12:19 PM
 That does help actually. 
That surprises me that [[AA]] is writing back. Hopefully it works out.</code></pre></div>
