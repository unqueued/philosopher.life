<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">If it were your job to decide what shows to show or not show on TV, what shows would you choose? Which ones would you eliminate and why?</h2><p>It becomes difficult to delineate between censorship, editing, programming, and even producing. Let me say, I feel exceedingly uncomfortable answering the question. Don't get me wrong, I think the vast, vast, vast majority of media produced is garbage and even worse for people. Note, however, the difference between preventing people from seeing something and them choosing not to see it. Further, there is a huge difference between what is legal and what is moral. </p><p>Is it immoral to produce terrible television, propaganda, or other bullshit? Yes. Should be it be illegal? No.</p><p>Ought the state or even information carrying companies regulate information? No, particularly not in the age of the Internet. Content creators, however, should be given significant legal freedoms. To that end, the traditional T.V. channel should be given latitude.</p><p>I don't trust people to censor. Admittedly, I don't trust people to curate either. </p><p>Maybe the question would be better worded as:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If it were your job to require people to see specific videos, which ones would they be? 
</p></blockquote><p>Simple. Go look at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Television%2520Show%2520Collection.html">Television Show Collection</a> and my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Movie%2520Collection.html">Movie Collection</a>. That would be a start. I think a number of documentaries and educational videos should be watched by the masses as well. There are many videos on the internet which are not mainstream T.V. which obviously merit our attention as well.</p><p>I want a well-cultured, highly empathic, extremely educated population on Earth. I think we need it.</p><p>Further, I think I would commission significant bodies of work if I had the power.</p><p>I think censorship should be done at an individual, granular level. I think we should be filters for ourselves, and make it so that others can easily use our filters as well. Networks built on such a concept could be quite useful. I think we already have it in many respects, but we are a long way off from what I'm talking about. It would require enormous cooperation though.</p></div>
