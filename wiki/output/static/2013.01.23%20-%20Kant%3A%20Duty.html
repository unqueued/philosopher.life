<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Kant begins by explaining the nature of the good will. He explains that only a good will is good and nothing else is absolutely good. Other things which might be desirable and good in certain circumstances aren‚Äôt necessarily and always good because they can be used for evil by an evil will. A good will is necessarily, unconditionally, and always good.1 A good will is not a means to another end, it is an end itself. He says it is ‚Äúlike a jewel‚Äù that will ‚Äúshine by itself.‚Äù2 It is good in itself and by virtue of nothing else. He explains, ‚ÄúUsefulness or fruitlessness can neither add anything to this worth nor take anything away from it.‚Äù3 Its usefulness may be attractive, and help engage those who aren‚Äôt lack experience in the matter of considering the value of the good will. The good will has absolute worth. Interestingly, the good will need not ‚Äúbe the sole and complete good, but it must still be the highest good and the condition of every other‚Äù good, including ‚Äúall demands for happiness.‚Äù4</p><p>Kant describes (very briefly) how reason is related to the good will. Reason is not for the sake of happiness, welfare, and preservation, but for the good will.5 Reason is a necessary precondition to having a good will. Reason exists to influence the will. The vocation of reason is the production of a good will.6 Only reason determines the good will (or is it the will entirely?).7</p><p>Shifting gears to the concept of duty (which explicates, contrasts, and highlights good will): we must act from, not merely in accordance with duty.8 If a maxim has moral content, then one has acted from duty. An action has moral worth only when it selected and motivated from duty (rather than inclination or any other kind of motivation). Pathological love, like other inclinations, cannot be commanded. We cannot be held responsible for inclinations, although we are held responsible for acting from inclinations. Practical love, in contrast to pathological love, can be commanded. Acting from duty can be commanded, and we can be held responsible for this.9</p><p>I‚Äôm way over my word limit here. The rest of the of the section deals with the actions of moral worth, the crossroads, the CI, the will, choice, maxims, etc. I have questions about this section and the metaphysics of morals section.</p><p>1 4:393</p><p>2 4:394</p><p>3 Ibid.</p><p>4 4:396</p><p>5 4:395</p><p>6 4:396</p><p>7 Ibid.</p><p>8 4:397</p><p>9 4:399</p><hr><p>January 23: Duty</p><p>Groundwork Section I (pp. 4:393-405)</p><p>Metaphysics of Morals (pp. 6:218-228)</p><p>Groundwork Section I (pp. 4:393-405)</p><p>4:393, Only a good will is good. Other things which might be desirable and good in certain circumstances aren‚Äôt necessarily and always good because they can be used for evil by an evil will. A good will is necessarily, unconditionally, and always good. Why is the good will really better than happiness? Maybe if we are stuck with a choice between the good will and happiness (where we can have either one or the other), it is the right thing to choose the good will, but it is unclear that it is the good.</p><p>4:394, ‚ÄúModeration in affects and passions, self-control, and calm reflection‚Ä¶seem to constitute a part of the inner worth of a person‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>4:394, A good will is not a means to another end, it is an end itself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶like a jewel, it would still shine by itself.‚Äù It is good in itself and by virtue of nothing else. ‚ÄúUsefulness or fruitlessness can neither add anything to this worth nor take anything away from it.‚Äù Its usefulness may be attractive, and help engage those who aren‚Äôt lack experience in the matter of considering the value of the good will. The good will has absolute worth.</p><p>4:395, Reason is not for the sake of happiness, welfare, and preservation, but for the good will. ??</p><p>4:396, Reason is a necessary precondition to having a good will. Reason exists to influence the will. The vocation of reason is the production of a good will.</p><p>4:396, The good will need not ‚Äúbe the sole and complete good, but it must still be the highest good and the condition of every other‚Äù good, including ‚Äúall demands for happiness.‚Äù Happiness is the second good, the second end, the second purpose of life, but it is conditional (unlike the good will).</p><p>4:396, Only reason determines the good will (or is it the will entirely?). Reason can be satisfied by determining the good will.</p><p>4:397, Duty helps explicate, contrast, and help shine forth the good will. We must act from, not merely in accordance with duty. What exactly is immediate inclination? The desire to preserve one‚Äôs life is an example. A man who preserves his own life without this immediate inclination has a maxim with moral content. If a maxim has moral content, then one has acted from duty. An action has moral worth only when it selected and motivated from duty (rather than inclination or any other kind of motivation).</p><p>4:399, Pathological love, like other inclinations, cannot be commanded. We cannot be held responsible for inclinations, although we are held responsible for acting from inclinations. Practical love, in contrast to pathological love, can be commanded. Acting from duty can be commanded, and we can be held responsible for this.</p><p>4:399-400, ‚Äúan action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose to be attained by it but in the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does not depend upon the realization of the object of the action but merely upon the principle of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object of the faculty of desire.‚Äù</p><p>4:400, the Crossroads, the will must be determined by an a priori principle (CI) in order for an action to be said from duty. I want a diagram of the following: inclinations, will, reason, crossroad, CI, maxim, principle of volition, material principle.</p><p>4:400, ‚Äúduty is the necessity of an action from respect from law‚Äù</p><p>4:400, ‚ÄúOnly what is connected with my will merely as ground and never as effect, what does not serve my inclination but outweighs it or at least excludes it altogether from calculations in making a choice ‚Äì hence the mere law for itself ‚Äì can be an object of respect and so a command.‚Äù ??</p><p>4:400, Only the moral law (objectively) and pure respect for this practical law (subjectively), and maxim of complying with this law and from this law, can determine the will. ??</p><p>4:401, ‚Äúnothing other than the respresentation of the law‚Äù in itself, which can of course occur only in a rational being, insofar as it and not the hoped-for effect is the determining ground of the will, can constitute the preeminent good we call moral‚Äù ??</p><p>4:402, ‚ÄúI ought never to act except in such a way that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.‚Äù We must ask ourselves if a maxim should be universalized, if we would be content with that.</p><p>Metaphysics of Morals (pp. 6:218-228)</p><p>6:211, The faculty of desire is the ability to cause the objects of one‚Äôs representations. ??</p><p>6:211, Kant explicates and relates pleasure, displeasure, feeling and dissected to desire.</p><p>6:212, Kant explicates practical pleasure, inactive delight. The ‚Äúdetermination of the faculty of desire which is caused and therefore necessarily preceded by such pleasure is called desire in the narrow sense, habitual desire is called inclination.‚Äù</p><p>6:213-214, Choice. Wish. Will. This section is clearly important. I don‚Äôt fully understand it.</p><p>6:221, The CI either permits or forbids.</p><p>It seems to me that even permitted actions are actually part of list of possible, mutually exclusive set(s) of actions that are obligated.</p><p>6:224, Right and wrong with respect to conforming to duty or failing to conform.</p><p>6:225, ‚ÄúA rule that the agent himself makes his principle on subjective grounds is called his maxim.‚Äù</p><p>6:226, ‚ÄúLaws proceed from the will, maxims from choice.‚Äù</p></div>
