<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>EQ is a helluva drug.</p><hr><p>I need to pause my EQ play. </p><p>I need to think.</p><p>Brilliant broken men play this game. </p><p>I need to make sure my children see themselves as building things for themselves. As in, real life things. I build things in this game, but they are just zeroes and ones. I'm good at it, but it does not matter. What actually matters to me is my life. I'm building the wrong life, playing the wrong sub-sub-sub-game, etc. I have to pivot my focus and coordination to a different configuration of sectors.  </p><p>I will stop playing EQ. It generates &quot;tokens&quot; and makes me feel happy. It is a skinner box though. See it for what it is. There are so many layers to this skinnerbox. Walk your way through it. You feel like your character, but you aren't your character. See your life as your character. Play life like a video game!</p><hr><p>I feel alone right now, but that's okay. I can see I am in a dialogue with myself here. I must write a shitty autistic story for myself. Lol. Ok. RPIN and KIN, join us in the dialectic. </p><pre><code>/spawn RPIN
/spawn KIN
/say Hey faggots! &lt;3
/shout woot woot!</code></pre><p>But, I am them. I'm not sure how to write the dialectic. The rules don't make sense to me. That's okay, though. </p><pre><code>/reset</code></pre><p>I am h0p3! I am having an existential moment here. Bear with me one moment. I feel like me again, creative, autonomous, here, in the now, ready to rock, executing the orders I hand to myself. I am like my EQ character but in IRL. I do not feel enslaved. I feel I like I control my destiny (despite and within that matrix of principles which govern, bound, and regulate us).</p><hr><p>I'm so glad I learned philosophy, but I'm glad I'm not trapped in some terrible economic system that evolved around it. Paying smart computers to teach you how to computer better, to shape your computing. There are many things I did not understand in that context (a billion times over). I must be practical! Plumb the depths which generates a fortune. Be a good EQ character, h0p3.</p><hr><p>Did you rise to the top quickly? You had to cheat, slip through a crack, or break the mechanics. This is one of the most invaluable things EQ taught me. I've seen it over and over and over again. I've seen it in all its shapes, kinds, type, sets, etc. That is the nature of &quot;innovation.&quot; Innovation is, of course, a two-edged sword. Who wields it? Conventions are not obligations, but one must still maintain principles for navigating the infinite series of rooms of dialectics here.</p><p>Seriously, the psychopathic specimens in our species are predators that infect, enslave, and consume humanity.</p><p>That is the world I live in.</p><hr><p>I have deleted the Virtual Machines from my hard drives. I'm done.</p><p>I am done with the game, but I am glad I did it. Like so many things in life, I'm glad it came, and I'm glad it went. I'm glad I've passed through the fires this time.</p><p>I named my characters &quot;Humanity,&quot; &quot;Hope,&quot; and &quot;Test,&quot; by the way. My last message in the EQ world was &quot;EQ is a Drug! I have to stop. GL!&quot; </p><p>Playing EQ has opened up the real world for me. It gave me footholds. I think, in a weird way, it was good for me. It shows me the dimensions of things.</p><p>I think it is a dangerous drug for my son. EQ is very dangerous to me. I could lose myself in that world. I need to write about Everquest. </p><p>Executive functioning right there, bro. Done. I nuked it. I really did enjoy that game. My brother was extremely kind for letting me play. He helped me a lot, and he knew I would love it. Thank you. This was a good test! I could see that game taking all of my time. I could have walked down that path for years. It was a beautiful world of mathematics. This game is my...</p><hr><p>How do I respond to my brother?</p><p>That is one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. It hit the spot, dead-on. It's an amazing drug for me. Thank you so much! It was like a vacation into a dream world. I enjoyed the experience immensely, but it was also a useful test for me. I needed to inspect it and myself. It has been a powerful force in my identity. I am going to use the EQ mindset to play life like a video game. You have opened my eyes and gave me a wild ride. Planning, researching, and grinding was an absolute rush! I love to see executive functioning pay off so directly and quickly. It has all the right short-term marshmallow test things going on inside that world. I have learned from it. Thank you.</p><hr><p>I cannot even begin to catalog the ways in which Everquest is a symbol for life. It's not the only one, but it is a strong one. It has many gateways to understands the frameworks, complexities, </p><p>My right index finger is numb and tingling. It has been for days. It feels like I can't use it. I should talk to my wife and see a doctor. I'm hoping to get off Teh Evercrack (EQ, Everquest, et al., etc.), 	</p><p>My children need to see themselves as adapting beings.</p><hr><p>The grind of life. EQ gave me mental representations, examples, frameworks, paradigms, metas, and turtles all the way down about life. </p><p>Everquest taught me to grind. Grinding has improved my life tremendously. I've always seen the metativity, but I've not chosen to explore it enough. I need to explore it more. That is, life itself is a grind that I can appreciate. I love to grind, to find the best way to grind it. It is fun to strategize. It is a game! What's wrong with obsessing about the game itself? Nothing, not as far as I can see anyways.</p><p>I need this grind mentality. I am an amazing worker with a few catches, quirks, etc. Iron those out, plan ahead, and you will blow everyone out around you in IRL that this is possible. You've done it in video games many times. I need to thank my brother. He gave me the drug, and after I exited the trance, I see more clearly now. That is the cliche, but there is something to it. It is what it is.</p><p>Everquest helped me understand the dimensions of life.</p><hr><p>I can see how my mother's letters were ways for her to digest the issue and be a catalyst to cause the right kind of reaction in the world. Splitting the two, I can see there is a packet for our own minds and a packet for external minds. Of course, I write this openly on purpose. I must avoid evasion. I must be honest. This is the CI.</p><hr><p>Playing life like a video game is hard. You have many pans and pots in the fire to juggle. You have to have just the right amount (the golden mean) of everything, in the right sequence, and so on. Virtue theory, of course, continues to stun me in its wisdom.</p><p>It's easy to have willpower in a video game. You're playing! The desire to play is already defined by you; it is assumed!</p><hr><p>I need to make more analogies to EQ. It is the language and world I can analogize to so strongly. Why not speak the language of EQ with myself? The metativity is ripe for the picking.</p><p>Consider this example: when I see my parents lives through the &quot;EQ&quot; lens, I see people who are very good at their video game, doing well with what they had. I think they have the wrong strategies though. I think their character development is deeply flawed, inefficient, and sometimes even self-defeating. I know this because I've done it myself. I've been there. I can empathize through this abstraction lens.</p><p>Of course, the lens always has the flaw of being overly reductive. You take the bad with the good.</p><p>Is this the right mode? Should I &quot;play life like a video game&quot;? To what extent, in what ways, what are the exceptions, and so on and so forth?</p><hr><p>Back to the problem at hand. How do I make my children happy? I'm raising EQ characters. How do I maximize their utility? What can I do for them?</p><p>In an immediate way, I see I still need to help hold them accountable to their schoolwork. I cannot simply allow my wife to bear this burden-joy. It is mine too!<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button></p><p>Furthermore, I need to be actually doing work with my children the whole time. I need to work alongside them. I need to teach them how to work with others, especially since they have precious few opportunities to do it. This is part of their socialization. (We are looking to play this skinnerbox of life correctly!)</p><p>I'm very autistic. I cannot understand their minds. I do not wish to manipulate them, only guide them. I must be friends with them.</p><p>My children need a game to plan. A real-life game. One that they take to be their real task in their off hours. I want them to squeeze it for everything it is worth. I want them to be obsessed with it. I want them to grind with it. I want them to play life like a video game, but I want to do it in a constructive way. Playing EQ itself was a way for me to come to understand that fact, but that doesn't mean it is the best path to come to understand it. I want them to be passionate and pour themselves into their work. I want to get their motors running, get that fire in their belly, and to help them see their true quests. How do I help them find joy and passion in building their lives? They have to own it! I can't be their slavedriver, I have to be their facilitator, their mentor, their guide, and their friend. What do I do!? How do I accomplish this task? It is of the utmost importance to me! I cannot simply rest upon the &quot;blind leading the blind,&quot; we must march forward, experiment, and continue to evolve our parenting to the needs of our children.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> I wasn't full-force lying to myself, but I think I was deceiving myself to some degree. I need to make sure the kids are doing their work as well.</sub></p></div>
