SAT 10:35 AM
I'm here.
SAT 10:35 AM
How's it going?
SAT 10:35 AM
Fine I've got a buddy who is bringing two or three pcs out here for me to buy and I've got one here now if you are still looking for a gamer for the kids
SAT 10:37 AM
It's a third generation i7, 8gb,500ssd,GeForce gtx 1030ti
SAT 10:39 AM
Where did you get too man
SAT 10:40 AM
Chat is asynchronous =)
SAT 10:40 AM
But I will have to order a case for it right now all I have is the components
SAT 10:41 AM
I've already bought GPUs to revamp what they have. It will be difficult to beat what I'm building for X-mas.
SAT 10:41 AM
I appreciate you looking out for me though.
SAT 10:42 AM
Dang big fancy word
SAT 10:42 AM
Just trying to help I know it's not much but I'm not a very rich person
SAT 10:43 AM
me neither, brother
SAT 10:43 AM
I hear that
SAT 10:43 AM
What are you building
SAT 10:43 AM
My daughter needs a machine for passthrough (linux primary, windows secondary). It's running a virtual machine that has direct access to the GPU (in this case).
SAT 10:44 AM
VT-x and VT-d are valuable
SAT 10:45 AM
I sold that amd machine and ordered a ninth generation i7 it does not have hyper threading but has 8 cores
SAT 10:45 AM
That's gonna be a sweet machine.
SAT 10:46 AM
I'll have my old cpu and mobo if you are interested
SAT 10:46 AM
Sounds like it
SAT 10:46 AM
You should try out virtualization.
SAT 10:48 AM
You should meet my buddy who is on his way up here he does software like you for a living maybe yall could understand each other lol
SAT 10:48 AM
You have literally top of the line enthusiast hardware, and you don't use it. It's like owning a ferrari to travel 50 feet.
SAT 10:48 AM
That sounds fun. I can't today. Lots of chores.
SAT 10:49 AM
I don't know what to use it for I'm duel booting windows 10 and 8.1 right now and it's doing the job
SAT 10:50 AM
I keep telling you: virtualize
SAT 10:50 AM
why dual boot when you can run both simultaneously?
SAT 10:50 AM
Well I can only use one at a time
SAT 10:51 AM
You aren't thinking outside the box here.
SAT 10:52 AM
I'm sure that I will be using it pretty soon to try out Linux
SAT 10:52 AM
Cool.
SAT 10:52 AM
Try manjaro and ubuntu out. I think those are solid choices for everyone.
SAT 10:53 AM
Yeah I'm going to be using it for Linux to learn it and see if I like it any
SAT 10:53 AM
Might as well fire it up now and try it. You can have it running in 10 minutes.
SAT 10:53 AM
Ubuntu is kinda like osx ain't it
SAT 10:54 AM
No.
SAT 10:54 AM
Can't getting ready to perform surgery on my pc
SAT 10:54 AM
Well it's kinda like windows then
SAT 10:55 AM
I think it will take a lot of reading and practice to understand the differences in the software, the communities, and the power structures involved.
SAT 10:55 AM
Research is necessary. Building the hardware machines is the easy part. Building the software ecosystems that run on top is the hard part, and that should be your quest, imho.
SAT 10:56 AM
I have to change all of the psu cables out and change out the mobo and cpu
SAT 10:56 AM
Well, you have a pretty ferrari.
SAT 10:57 AM
Buy my old cpu off me and you can have one too
SAT 10:58 AM
Ha, I hear that.
SAT 10:58 AM
I'll let you make payments if you need too
SAT 10:58 AM
Only catch is your ram is pretty expensive for ddr4
SAT 10:59 AM
It's a tempting offer, and I appreciate it. I simply can't afford to build out a new system at this point.
SAT 11:00 AM
That RAM is expensive. You are right.
SAT 11:00 AM
It's expensive enough that it will likely mean I buy used from now on.
SAT 11:00 AM
I assume my next purchase will be an old server.
SAT 11:01 AM
(may be a while)
SAT 11:01 AM
I'm just doing what I know hardware is what I went to school for and how I make my living I just don't have that much time to start learning something new but I would like to try it out
SAT 11:01 AM
You could get ram for what you would be paying for a server
SAT 11:02 AM
Naw.
SAT 11:03 AM
Ram and a case and reuse your old hard drives and boom
SAT 11:03 AM
Anyways, I appreciate it, thank you.
SAT 11:03 AM
You don't have to worry about paying me any time soon and I guess I could loan you some of my ram until you can get you some
SAT 11:04 AM
But I'm single and my kids are grown that's the only reason I can buy this stuff plus a good discount from my distributor
SAT 11:05 AM
I appreciate that as well. Thank you for the offer. Until I land a job that makes good money, it's probably not going to happen.
SAT 11:07 AM
I've put in my dues to family life I just got a early start at it, I was 15 years old when I got married because my ex got pregnant and I wanted to support my baby and be there in her life like my dad was for me
SAT 11:09 AM
I hear that. Had my first at 19.
SAT 11:10 AM
Still in the grind.
SAT 11:10 AM
Believe me I would rather have kids again then any piece of computer equipment, and I've pretty much gave up on trying to meet a girl because all the ones I meet seems to be trash but I guess it's because of meeting them at bars but I don't know where else to meet a girl at being middle aged and all, does your wife have any friends?
SAT 11:14 AM
Not really. We don't even have time to have friends. We stay in touch with people who don't live anywhere in the area.
SAT 11:14 AM
OK if you change your mind about the cpu and mobo let me know if I haven't sold it yet you can always pay me back when you get a job
SAT 11:16 AM
Man I am so depressed!! It's coming up on the anniversary of when my dad passed man I can't even explain to you how good he was to me and he suffered so much before he died
SAT 11:18 AM
=(
SAT 11:18 AM
I'm sorry.
SAT 11:18 AM
Depression is a wolf on your back.
SAT 11:19 AM
It forces a set of goggles on you that make it so you can see the world and yourself as you might otherwise.
SAT 11:19 AM
I have wrestled with it for a long time (and I would not call myself successful).
SAT 11:19 AM
I've taken to writing. A lot.
SAT 11:20 AM
You might be interested in that too, I don't know.
SAT 11:20 AM
You might consider setting up a wiki to help you write; it might help you too. I don't know.
SAT 11:21 AM
Write about what your dad meant and means to you.
SAT 11:21 AM
Tell his story again.
SAT 11:21 AM
I usually just prefer to tell people about him but whatever I say to anyone can never do him justice
SAT 12:12 PM
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you
SAT 12:12 PM
Hey buddy are you still there and BTW what does that big word mean that you said earlier in our conversation
SAT 12:20 PM
Well, you tell it to me in text, and I will maintain the structure for you, if you want.
SAT 12:33 PM
a¬∑syn¬∑chro¬∑nous
/ƒÅÀàsiNGkr…ôn…ôs/

        (of an orbit) such that a satellite in it is asynchronous.
SAT 12:34 PM
Well shit
SAT 12:45 PM
Im to lazy to type all that shoot I'm too lazy to type that one big word
SAT 12:46 PM
That can be fixed. It's a choice. =)
SAT 12:46 PM
Hey I meant to ask you, when you left so quickly the other day I was talking about me and my buddys had went to a gay club to meet women a few times and I sure do hope that you didn't get the wrong idea and think I was a homo or perverted or something like that because I'm definitely not, it was just bothering me that you left so quickly the other day, I mean you didn't even get to drink your coffee
SAT 12:50 PM
As I said, I had a lot to do. I was just stopping in to visit you! I know you aren't homosexual, and I wouldn't have a problem with it if you were. My brother is gay, and he is one of my best friends.
SAT 12:53 PM
Thank you for the coffee. I'm sorry I did not drink it all. I appreciate your having me over in your house and offering me your hospitality too. =)
SAT 12:53 PM
I appreciate you coming over I always look forward to to getting to talk to you, I learn something new every time, feel free to stop by anytime bud
SAT 12:56 PM
And I don't have anything against gays either I just don't understand it, I've always wondered if they were born like that or actually makes a conscious decision to be like that, I personally think that nobody would choose to be picked on and beat up and things that they have to go through
SAT 12:59 PM
What does your brother say about that?
SAT 12:59 PM
He would argue that his sexual preferences are a result of genetic and environmental forces. I hold a very unpopular view in suggesting our freewill is radical enough that we can (to some minor extent) influence our fluid sexuality on a spectrum, but I think our degrees of freedom are quite limited.
SAT 1:02 PM
It has certainly been a very difficult life for him, and it is part of a cluster of issues he has had to wrestle with.
SAT 1:02 PM
Yeah that's what I thought too, I don't know why someone would want to put themselves through that
SAT 1:04 PM
He didn't put himself through it, imho (though he has fought to survive). We have structured a world that put him through it.
SAT 1:05 PM
I know that's what I said is that I don't know why someone would put themselves through that
SAT 1:06 PM
Man you misunderstood me I was trying to take up for your brother not dis him reread my text
SAT 1:21 PM
You may have misunderstood what I said. I did not claim you dissed him. I also think if someone could choose, one might still choose be homosexual even through persecution. It is crucial to me that we distinguish what they are choosing.
SAT 3:19 PM
Brother I think you are a good guy and all but I swear sometimes you are little too much for me to keep up with, I really don't understand some of the stuff you say, if you don't care would you try to play dumb when we are talking that way I'll know whatcha mean, thanks bud
SAT 4:58 PM
I'll do what I can. I'm not always so good at communicating to everyone. Hopefully in time, with practice, we'll understand each other better.
SAT 5:42 PM
I sure do hope so because I would like to consider you a good friend of mine and I would like for you to meet the rest of the guys all of which are computer geeks like us yall would get along great just remember that they are not super smart either, I hope you don't get tired of talking to me because I'm not very bright
SAT 10:33 PM
It's no problem! =)
SAT 10:34 PM
Also, I'm still thinking about your CPU. I would actually use it. Is there a way I could trade you?
SAT 10:39 PM
I need a working computer at the end of the day, and I know I would use that CPU.
SAT 10:39 PM
These are my specs:
SAT 10:39 PM
Intel Xeon E3-1240 v3, 16GB RAM, GeForce GTX 750 Ti, ASRock B85M-ITX, 120GB Kingston SSD (/ and swap), 250GB Samsung 840 SSD (/home), 1TB Wester Digital HDD (/mnt/storage), DVD/CD-Writer, CX500M 500W (the lone system fan, lol), LIAN LI PC-Q07B modded with velcro mounts for drives and cut to fit dual slot card
SAT 10:39 PM
It's a custom small form factor build that fits into a very small case: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112227
SAT 10:40 PM
I call her &quot;monster-10&quot; lol
SAT 10:40 PM
Unfortunately most of my business is in newer stuff the computer shops I work for don't normally accept used equipment from me that is why I had so much trouble getting rid of that amd build but I will be happy to front it too you but what are you going to do for a mobo and ram though I can get my stuff really cheap I only paid $300 for the i9 9900k cpu and it's selling for over $500 at Newegg!
SAT 10:48 PM
Lol, wow.
SAT 10:49 PM
How do you get it that cheap?
SAT 10:49 PM
Perhaps the best option is just for me to wait.
SAT 10:51 PM
I can live with what I have comfortably enough.
SAT 10:51 PM
Servers that come with 128GB (or more) of RAM off ebay is likely my best route in the end.
SAT 10:52 PM
I do eventually hope to completely virtualize everything with a type 1 hypervisor.
SAT 10:52 PM
I don't mind DDR3, for example. The performance different really isn't that big, imho. Total RAM matters more to me than the latency.
SAT 10:54 PM
I have used them for a long time and I pay a annual fee for for membership dues and such, I hope you are not mad at me me I won't be in no rush for my money and I will let you have it for a good deal maybe you could sell it and invest in a good used server board usually you can get used server stuff pretty cheap on eBay and they would have more cores and more ram and cheaper ram than ddr4 anyways I think ddr3 ram is still pretty high though and you would have tons of power I might have went that route if I hadn't already had the board and ram
SAT 10:59 PM
Well, I'll think about it still. Without being able to trade though (and I totally understand), I think it is best for me to wait. I appreciate your thinking about it.
SAT 11:00 PM
Well if I do trade I don't know what to trade for it's not equal to your stuff I just don't know how I could sell server stuff but if you think you can come up with the rest of the equipment then I can wait until tax return time I mean you can pay me whenever you want to I'm in no hurry at all for the money I would not mind the ssds but the cpu is not worth what your ssds are worth so I will help you anyway I can bud
SAT 11:06 PM
Hey do you remember if the front side of a fan is intake or exhaust I can't find any arrow signs on it I'm putting I'm replacing my two 120mm fans with 140mm ones because I'm just going to keep my old case cause I can't afford another one first of all but also I couldn't find one that had a 5.25 drive slot and had mounting for my radiator and my rgb fans so I'll just keep what I have I guess
SAT 11:16 PM
Hey I have 3 120mm rgb fans now that I'm not using anymore and I have a controller for them too so you don't have to use a motherboard to control them you do it with three small buttons you can have them for your build if you want they are expensive if you like them
SAT 11:20 PM
Yes for free you heard me right nigga
SAT 11:20 PM
Lol. I appreciate that.
SAT 11:28 PM
Do you know which way it goes man I need your help
SAT 11:29 PM
I think that depends on the case. It is one of the classic debates.
SAT 11:29 PM
I think front that air comes out of what do you think
SAT 11:29 PM
I think it is depends on the case, lol. Test them both if it matters. Personally, I'm just not that worried about heat.
SAT 11:30 PM
The CPUs automatically downclock.
SAT 11:30 PM
I use a CPU fan and the PSU, and I have no troubles (I've never had to clean my case out once in 5 years either).
SAT 11:31 PM
I used to care a lot more about it, but I just don't see the point.
SAT 11:31 PM
I don't OC anymore either though.
SAT 11:31 PM
Well I use a water cooler so I don't care either but but my 1080ti gets a little warm I think I've never really checked the temperature of it my cpu is cold I've checked it I just want to do it right or it will drive me nuts
SAT 11:33 PM
I, uh, think it is not a valuable use of your time.
SAT 11:33 PM
Every minute spent on your hardware is better spent on learning software.
SAT 11:34 PM
I will continue to point  you in that direction.
SAT 11:34 PM
The difference between X horsepower and X-1 horsepower on a Ferrari is not nearly as relevant as actually making use of that Ferrari.
SAT 11:34 PM
I legitimately don't think you are going to lose any horsepower in this case either.
SAT 11:34 PM
I don't know why you are laughing at my rgb fans for, I think they look cool and they are in style for your information young man
SAT 11:35 PM
Lol. I'll laugh at the young man part. I'm not laughing at you. I'm telling you that you've misdirected your focus. If you want to make the most of that computer, it won't be in fine-tuning every last detail of the hardware: it will be  in using the hardware.
SAT 11:36 PM
That's true but you don't have no software with out no hardware Ponder that buddy
SAT 11:36 PM
That is an arrogant claim.
SAT 11:36 PM
I am telling you, and you aren't listening.
SAT 11:37 PM
I am just saying that some one has to do the hands on and someone has to build the software and software is a lot harder for me I think anyway
SAT 11:38 PM
I totally appreciate that software is hard. I am terrible at it myself! It is still worth everyone ounce of your time. I'm trying to give you advice on how to become better with your computer.
SAT 11:40 PM
Where should you spend your time and money? It seems obvious to me that, atm, it's software.
SAT 11:41 PM
I suggest time is the most important investment at this point.
SAT 11:41 PM
Normally the front of the case is intake and rear is exhaust I just want to get everything done right even though I'm not really that worried about heat in the case
SAT 11:42 PM
That's true I agree
SAT 11:42 PM
But for me software doesn't pay the bills though lol
SAT 11:43 PM
Even though it does for some people
SAT 11:43 PM
You are asking for advice on your personal computer for your personal computing. This isn't business.
SAT 11:44 PM
This is figuring out how to make that machine worth your time and money.
SAT 11:44 PM
Software is where you need to spend your time.
SAT 11:44 PM
Especially since you know it's your weakness at the moment.
SAT 11:44 PM
I do a little software work I for repairing and building pcs
SAT 11:45 PM
I understand that. My advice still stands.
SAT 11:45 PM
But I just can't find anything that interests me right now, any suggestions?
SAT 11:45 PM
Sometimes you must spend time in things which don't immediately gratify you here. I have suggested Virtual machines and Linux.
SAT 11:46 PM
Those are worthy uses of your time, and they are the way to make use of your hardware with efficiency.
SAT 11:46 PM
Yeah I'm planning on checking out Linux some it includes your drivers don't it
SAT 11:48 PM
Yes.
SAT 11:48 PM
But, again, I think you should just virtualize it for now.
SAT 11:48 PM
Eventually, you may end up just virtualizing windows on Linux instead (that's what we do in our house).
SAT 11:49 PM
It's a beautiful world!
SAT 11:49 PM
I'm going to install it on virtual machine right now and see how it goes I have to make sure my software that I use is compatible with it
SAT 11:50 PM
Lol
SAT 11:50 PM
Virtualbox is free. It has it's advantages.
SAT 11:50 PM
I can get you VMWare as well, if you prefer.
SAT 11:51 PM
It must be pretty good everybody loves it
SAT 11:51 PM
I've got VMware boot legged do you think it's better
SAT 11:52 PM
I'm worried about your sources. You had ransomware before.
SAT 11:52 PM
Virtualbox is guaranteed to be clean.
SAT 11:52 PM
Almost all of my software is cracked
SAT 11:52 PM
I can say that there are cases where VMWare is preferred, but there are cases where Virtualbox is preferred.
SAT 11:52 PM
Preach, homie. I have no problem with that at all!
SAT 11:53 PM
(there are other virtualization tools too, btw...those are two I'm recommending to you right now)
SAT 11:53 PM
I suggest Virtualbox to start out with.
SAT 11:53 PM
That shit is expensive got to save money where I can the only good software is free software
SAT 11:54 PM
Software should be free.
SAT 11:54 PM
(I'm a radical on the matter)
SAT 11:54 PM
Well I don't agree with you at all on that
SAT 11:54 PM
I just think that it should not be so expensive though
SAT 11:55 PM
You are free to debate me. If you think I'm knowledgeable about computers, you've not even seen my expertise in this field. This is my area of expertise.
SAT 11:57 PM
Our software designers have to get paid too or else there is no insintive for them to design it but they should not rob people and they should not use it for bad purposes
SAT 11:57 PM
=)
SAT 11:58 PM
Why do they have to get paid? What makes you think the market is what actually generated the incentives for the most important software (and computer science) in the world? What makes you think the market isn't definitionally robbing people, and why should I think they aren't using it for bad purposes?
SAT 11:59 PM
BTW we figured out how to get rid of random ware without losing your data or having to reformat
SAT 11:59 PM
If you are rooted, you should reformat.
SUN 12:00 AM
