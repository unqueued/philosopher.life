<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>We disagree on the rules of engagement for our relationship, the nature of the world, what we are hoping to accomplish, etc. Our goals do not align. We are opposed to each others' identities, and there is no hiding it.</p><p>Moreover, I'm not here to play some shallow play-along surface game. We're all in or we are all out. I'm not half-assing it. Problematically, you've caused too much pain for this to be healed soon. I suppose I will be feeling the burns for a long time. The reasons against us are legion.</p><hr><p>Just as I owe my past self nothing and my futures self everything, I owe my creators nothing and my creations everything. I create myself, and I owe my creations. Responsibility is a one-way portal.</p><hr><p>I told my brother about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> page I've been working on. He asked me if I would feel a huge loss for not believing it months from now. What an odd question to ask. I told him I didn't know and that I wasn't completely committed to this. It's simply the best option I have right now.</p><p>I actually want to understand his opinion. What was going through his head? He hesitated a jumbled his words and question for a second, as if he wanted to ask another question and offer another set of comments. I wish I knew what they were.</p><p>Sometimes I think he doesn't actually care about my pursuit of meaning. I find that odd. Well, I will move on without him if I must. =/ ... He is easily &quot;philosophied out.&quot; It's a shame. If I find an answer that I am satisfied with long-term, I will make sure to come back for him. </p><hr><p>I concede, I could be crazy. The loss of my faith in God and Humanity, having the veil violently ripped away, yet again losing my innocence, being redpilled into another vortex, has splintered and shattered me. I am still picking up the pieces, as you can see. It was a complex structure that broke, and given the other stresses in my life, I am lucky to put anything back together.</p><hr><p>I haven't had any standardly conceived mind-altering substances in quite a while now. Today has been a day of serious clarity. I feel like my ability to focus has spiked! I'm paying attention, and I love that I'm doing that!</p></div>
