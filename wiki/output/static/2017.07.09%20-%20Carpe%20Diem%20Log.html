<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><ul><li>I woke up a bit later. Fireman time!</li><li>I packed. </li><li>I played some league.</li><li>Seeing my family come through the door made me realize that I wasn't going to be seeing them. It hit me harder then.</li><li>My son sat around playing next to me. I didn't have much to say, but I wish I did! I felt so frozen and sad.</li><li>I packed some more, and I made pizza.<ul><li>I ended up eating most of the pizza, as I took it with me for my dinner as well.</li></ul></li><li>When my wife came back the second time, I started loading the car up (except the food).</li><li>We had our family time.</li><li>Afterwards, I said I had to go. We hugged, and we cried. I love my family so much. It really hurts to be away.</li><li>I packed the rest of it, gave my finals hugs, and waved goodbye as I drove off.</li><li>It took about 3.5 hours to get there. One full-gas-tankable. <ul><li>I listened to Infomacracy on the way there. It's a slower book, imho, but a good one.</li></ul></li><li>I arrived at the house. Nobody answered. I called Armstrong, and he said &quot;oops.&quot; He gave me the wrong address. Thankfully, his place was nearby.</li><li>The house is a wreck, but it is clean enough, the AC works, and I have a bed and some fridge/cabinet space. I can live with it.<ul><li>I don't even have a doorknob on my door. </li><li>I'm worried about bedbugs, honestly.</li><li>The lack of functional internet is killing me. That must be remedied asap.</li></ul></li><li>Armstrong and I talked quite a bit and got to know each other. <ul><li>Think a young Idris Elba from The Office, a hustler. That's what he is. </li></ul></li><li>Armstrong wanted cash, not a check. Clearly, under the table.</li><li>I'm glad I brought my safe! The neighborhood is not to be trusted.</li><li>I went the ATM to pick up the cash, and I checked out my place of work. 5 minutes away (although, I assume I'll be traveling to the job sites as well).</li><li>I'm mostly moved in now.</li><li>I talked more with Armstrong as we tried to fix the internet. His modem/router combo is a complete piece of shit. He's obviously not going to fix it. <ul><li>I think I will cash out my Eth to help buy the van. </li></ul></li><li>I'm reading and writing late.</li><li>I hope my wife continues to write to me on her wiki, or at least about her day. It may be the only way I get to know how her day was.<ul><li>I love you!</li></ul></li></ul></div>
