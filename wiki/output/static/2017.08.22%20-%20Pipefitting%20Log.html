<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I arrived early enough. This is the first time I've had a laptop on the job. I think it will make me far more productive on my breaks. I really can't write significant quantities on my phone for a bunch of reasons. The software ecosystem is not developed for someone who wants control of their computer. It is infuriating. Simple tasks take far longer than they should. I've really missed being able to type in the mornings, to get it out, to prepare my mind, to put it into context, etc. Also, I am annoyed that my tethering is so fucking slow. Slurping through a 10kB straw, fuck that.</p><p>I talked with Chris in the car quite a bit about why I'm pipefitting and what I hope to achieve with this. He is receptive. The more I think and talk about it, the more convinced I am that I should aim for a fab shop job. I need to quickly cover the landscape. I wish I had done that with philosophy, and I think I should do something similar with pipefitting. Experience is experience, and being able to fit that experience into a broader context is useful. </p><p>I hope I remember to edit my contact information. I really need to do that. Some numbers are more important than others. I really need a way to organize them to my liking. I don't want just some giant list. That isn't how it should work. But, I don't know what categories are most useful to me. </p><p>A new fitter, Christopher, showed up. Calling him Chris-X until I figure what X is out. So many double names. He's kind so far. He's been a fitter for 20 years and was a welder before that. He is a tool-whore like I am. He immediately understood far more about what we were doing than our other journeyman. I hope to learn a lot from him.</p><p>I forgot to sign in. Apparently, they were talking about it in the office. I was the &quot;culprit&quot; as they phrased it. Okay? Anyways, I got that taken care of.</p><p>David-M handed me the hot work permit (and the other to David-C). I'm also in charge of all the group's paperwork. He also stopped and gave me an iso for 291. He said he'll get more to me. Cool. </p><p>I quickly gathered everything. I guess it was my job to get done. I've got the hang of how things work now, I believe. I grabbed everything we needed and starting setting up. I had to ask for a firewatch. Their foreman, mama bear, was kind to me. Although, she wasn't happy with her underling.</p><p>Chris-X and I finished the demo job from yesterday. It was easy enough. We couldn't find David. So, we talked and thought about the job until the break.</p><p>It's Christopher Monks (as opposed to Christopher Range, my friend). Chris-M used to be a foreman, but it gave him heart attacks. So, he has decided to chill as a journeyman fitter. He stopped welding to save his eyes. He's a smart guy in many respects. He is obviously very experienced. </p><p>We helped David-M rig and move a bunch of supports for Area 4. It's finally happening. I see it slowly coming together. </p><p>I heard from Chris(-R) that Jacobs is losing all its contracts or something like that at Eastman. I assume that means the fab shop at Jacobs is out of the question or something like that. I also heard that Yates is picking up longterm contracts here for fitting. I hope that is true. I could do this long-term.</p><p>Chris-M went over his tool-list with me. Apparently, on many jobs, they go through your box to make sure you have what you say you have and that you aren't stealing. They won't even pay you until you turn the list in either (haven't experienced this). I should have that list ready. I showed him my toolbox. He said it was a great start.</p><p>Chris-M and I worked on putting in the support at the top of 234. We drilled the holes and had the ropes setup and tied off for me to hold it so he can put the concrete wedge anchors into place. </p><p>It took longer than anticipated to finish the mounting of this custom support. We drilled the holes fine, but the last one of was. We tried a mag-drill, but the welding machine couldn't power it. We ended up using a burbit on the end-grinder to hit the hole on the steel of the support to match the hole we drilled in the concrete. Was my first time, and apparently, it is a dangerous tool. Went fine though. I obviously need a decent end grinder with bits.</p><p>I talked to Chris-M a ton. He understands the landscape and the trade so much better than I do. I'm soaking it in.</p><p>He has a daughter 13 (to my 11) and son 11 (to my 9), and he's 46 (wishes he had them younger, he says...and I told him I wish I was older) Also, he just started homeschooling, and he often lives in a van. A lot of the same tricks for being semi-homeless that I wanted to use he in fact uses. Very interesting guy.</p><p>I can feel the blood pressure or something in my toe. It hurts. </p><p>David-M came to see what we did. He said &quot;good job.&quot; He is obviously impressed with Chris-M. Also, he complimented me on the tools I had. They are very nice tools. =) He made a dick joke about the length of my screwdriver.</p><p>Also, it is much easier for me to write on the laptop. A billion times over. I have no idea how kids do it on phones. The ecosystem still lacks maturity, the screen size is unbearable, and I can still crush on a real keyboard. Call me an old-fogey or whatever, but let me stick with tools that allow me to be productive. I strongly prefer it.</p></div>
