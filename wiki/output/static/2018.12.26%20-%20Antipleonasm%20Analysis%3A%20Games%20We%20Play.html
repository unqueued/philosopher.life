<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Respond to the following:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You know what I learnt losing that duel? I learnt that I'll never win. Not that way. That's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them, I'm going to f**k them. That's what I know, that's what I am, and only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
</p></blockquote><p>This quote screams dialectic. Our identities are tied up in our adversarial and cooperative relationships with ourselves and others into <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="infinigress.html">infinigress</a>. </p><p>Box a brawler, brawl a boxer. Hit 'em where they ain't. Who's the beatdown? Cue the queue of Art of War theorems! Why play a game you know you are going to lose? If the point of a game, Sirlin,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button> is to win, then why play a game you are confident, if not certain, you will lose?</p><p>Ah, Petyr, I know your convenient mistake; you hide yourself from the ultimate game: the virtuous pursuit of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520End.html">The End</a>. The points matter, but no one can count them perfectly (including not even yourself for yourself). You are obligated to play <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Existential%2520Game.html">The Existential Game</a> <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a>, and this is fundamentally intertwined with computing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a> (and playing all of its subgames). Some games must be played even when you know you are going to lose. It is courage, integrity, and honestly admitting who we are. If you do not know the purpose of your own life, you really don't know yourself.</p><p>Thus, I conclude, Petyr has not taken his own advice to the N<sup>th</sup> degree. He does not <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="right.html">right</a>ly know who he is, and thus he cannot admit it either. He can get what he wants, but that also doesn't mean he should. There is a difference between having the moral right to satisfy our desires and simply satisfying them without justification. If &quot;winning&quot; the game is desire satisfaction (and, clearly, it isn't), he's also conceptually boned on the hedonic and Will to Power treadmills. </p><p>That said, maybe there is no way out.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">s : </span> I enjoyed speaking with him.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">a : </span> At first glance, it is not clear if admission is necessary for getting what we want. There are cases where that is not true, but perhaps ultimately that is going to be necessary. It is likely correct, since I'm convinced <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Know%2520Thyself.html">Know Thyself</a> is profoundly connected with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Virtue%2520is%2520Knowledge.html">Virtue is Knowledge</a>. You must know that you know and know that you don't know what you don't know to whatever boundaries and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> that you can. The pursuit of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> is not easy.</sub></p></div>
