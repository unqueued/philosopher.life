<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I've been mulling these around. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#181222%20%E2%80%93%20Log%3A%20inside%2Foutside%20meaning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#181222%20%E2%80%93%20Log%3A%20inside%2Foutside%20meaning</a></p><p>I think perhaps something comes into focus when the outsider writes and contemplates, right? 
</p></blockquote><p>Bingo, even if it means we become our own outsiders to ourselves. The dialectic may even conceptually require an openness to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="other.html">other</a>'s perspective. I'm still trying to put my finger on how this works.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I only see myself internally and the reasons for the choices I make are just there and I don't have to search for them.
</p></blockquote><p>I do not know, madame. </p><p>Sometimes that claim seems correct to me, and other times it doesn't. I don't have a solid answer.</p><p>I'm searching and aiming to uncover reasons inside me (without confabulation or rationalization) to which I wasn't initially able to consciously attend. There is a kind of gnostic problem in what it means to hide things from ourselves or to engage in self-discovery. I think I have a very limited self-model (and, conceptually, that project cannot be completed); which is why I'm strongly attached to the &quot;only see myself internally&quot; claim. I think the wiki enables me to uncover myself (even if only to myself in some cases). I don't know myself all the way down.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>So I don't want to disrupt the interesting outside point of view by explaining myself.
</p></blockquote><p>I think that demonstrates serious integrity and aims to be fittingly open. I think it's courageous!</p><p>As you have seen, however, I am grateful for any guidance from you in engaging in this practice. Your pain screams out of your wiki at me (as does your joy!). The honesty in your wiki is vulnerable in a way I'm not used to seeing outloud from the outside.</p><p>Have you ever been given a gift so fragile, elegant, and valuable you felt uncomfortable and unqualified to handle or have the right to engage with the gift?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">f</sup></button> It's like being given a talisman or a sacred heirloom as a kid who doesn't appreciate what they have been given. I'm honored to have been granted the right to speak to you at this level, and I do not want to make a single mistake here.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">r</sup></button></p><p>Since <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="IA2DYJ.html">IA2DYJ</a>, I am especially interested in making sure I'm listening more than talking (which is not my strong suit!). I cannot afford to be careless here, especially since I often misunderstand too much. I do not take my responsibility as your friend lightly.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>it's like...Moby Dick, right, and symbolism, and how one pulls out and elaborates on the meanings through their own lens and can see things that the author didn't even intend to put in there - but even if they weren't consciously intended by the author there's still something to that sort of analysis, I think...
</p></blockquote><p>I see where you are coming from, I think. Put a quarter in me, lol. This is a longstanding discussion between me and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a>. The pursuit of truth here is a quagmire. I do not wish to read into your words simply what I want to see, nor do I simply want to say what you want to hear. I hope to read+write what we both need. I do feel confident in the claim that our responses to authors (which includes our eisegetical injections) give rise to emerging narratives, and this is a crucial part of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Great%2520Human%2520Conversation.html">The Great Human Conversation</a>. I think that is how we build ourselves with each other.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#181227%20%E2%80%93%20weaving%3A%20names%20part%20two" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#181227%20%E2%80%93%20weaving%3A%20names%20part%20two</a></p><p>Perhaps you've been saying this all along and I haven't heard it or seen it properly but ‚Äì names are like antipleonismic salience pointers!! I have the hardest time coming up with names/titles for my projects because I am trying to find the right words to encapsulate the salient essence of the project ‚Äì which is diamondic and antipleonismic, as I understand those terms.</p><p>(and I think I tend to lean toward naming with metaphors that somehow point to the most salient aspect of something for me, though they're still very much works in progress.)
</p></blockquote><p>They are connected strongly in my eyes. I cannot say all names are strongly <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="salient.html">salient</a> or antipleonasmic. The essentialism point is right on the money. I'm very grateful to you for listening so closely. =) I regret to say I still don't have enough material to flesh this out as much as it deserves. I'm working toward it.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">f : </span> I am not calling you some dainty damsel in distress.
