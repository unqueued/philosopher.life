I will consider why Husserl is interested in apodicticity, what he means by apodicticity, and how he believes phenomenology yields apodictic results. I am unsatisfied that he reaches his goal, unless he lowers the standards of apodicticity and objectivity.</p><p>In Logische Untersuchungen, Husserl considers how knowledge is possible and what conditions must be met in order for one to have knowledge.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> He criticizes psychologism, which argues epistemology is naturalistically ‚Äúconcerned with the cognitive nature of perceiving, believing, judging, and knowing‚Äù and thus claims the status of logic requires empirical investigation and verification.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> This is a large error in Husserl‚Äôs view, he thinks logic and mathematics, for example, are factual, real, empirical objects, but rather that logic and mathematics are ideal laws or structures. Husserl associates logic and mathematics with a sort of certainty which empirical investigations can‚Äôt provide.</p><p>Psychologism fails, in Husserl‚Äôs view, because it attempted to empirically reduce ideal things to real, factual things (like naturalistic objects). The object of knowledge, in this case, logic or mathematics, is an ideal object, is distinguished from the act of knowing, although the two are connected (they must be if we are to know any logical and mathematical truths).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> Husserl believes that in order to understand ideality and this connection between the object of knowledge and act of knowing, we must investigate consciousness, but not as a natural and empirical examination (as psychologism would have us do).</p><p>No truth is a fact, i.e. something determined as to time. A truth can indeed have as its meaning that something is, that a state exists, that a change is going on etc. The truth itself is, however, raised above time: i.e. it makes no sense to attribute temporal being to it, nor to say that it arises or perishes (Hua 18/87 [109-110]).</p><p>The truth that 2 + 3 = 5 stands all by itself as a pure truth whether there is a world, and this world with these actual things, or not (Hua 9/23).</p><p>It seems as if Husserl is claiming that logic (of which mathematics is a subset) is objectively true, and that it is true independent of our existence. What does Husserl claim to be the ontic status of the logical truths which are independent of us? I don‚Äôt know. He seems to push a sort of Platonism in his early work, but a bit later, it seems as though he is so vehemently against metaphysics that he can‚Äôt really hold onto this kind of objectivity of logical truth.</p><p>To know a logical truth seems to be the epitome having certainty in Husserl‚Äôs philosophy. It is intuitively obvious and evident that, for example, P = P. When we know a logical truth, we have no doubt about it. We are certain about it; it is apodictically given to us. This sets the standard for what counts as ultimate knowledge in Husserl‚Äôs philosophy.</p><p>The root of Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology is the pursuit of certainty ‚Äì apodictic knowledge. Adequacy is not enough, he seeks absolute indubitability.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> ‚ÄúAn apodictic evidence is not only certain evidence of its objects but is also ‚Äò‚Äòthe absolute unimaginableness (inconceivability) of their non-being‚Äô‚Äô (Hua I,</p><p>p. 56; 1977, p. 16).‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> This is a very strong conception of knowledge as fully justified belief. Husserl‚Äôs initial conception of apodicticity does not seem to admit of degrees. You either have apodictic belief or you don‚Äôt. This raises the question: Is knowledge itself infallible ‚Äì if you have it, do you definitionally possess the truth? This is an radical view, one which Husserl may have originally accepted, but perhaps moved away from.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button></p><p>We may think of certainty, or apodicticity (which I will use interchangeably), as an extreme epistemic property of beliefs. Even if Husserl would agree to a distinction between knowledge and certainty, he would have to argue that certainty is either the singularly highest degree of knowledge or a higher kind of knowledge.</p><p>Phenomenology, as the apodictic science, is theoretically-speaking, an infallible method for achieving certain belief, i.e. knowledge. The process as a practice, however, the implementation of the method, is filled with fallibility. According to Hopp, agent-fallibility is the problem.</p><p>This is highly analogous to logic. Logic, as a method, is said to be truth-preserving. The theoretical steps and the method itself can only take you from one truth to another truth. Phenomenology, likewise, preserves apodictic belief. In Logic, we use deduction, in phenomenology, we use analyze what intuitively given to us. The problem in practicing logic is that I as an agent can fail to apply it ‚Äì I am fallible. The same is true for practicing phenomenology.</p><p>Unfortunately, the analogy becomes weakens when in the method of verification. Logical deductions use small steps, clearly written ‚Äì nothing is more precise and spelled-out than logic. The steps are obviously reliable and we are certain of them. Logic is also methodologically simple in some sense. Logic is a method that is testable by a computer ‚Äì it is that mindless (I use the word with the utmost respect for logic) of an activity. Verification and replicability seem very straightforward in logic. Phenomenology, however, is quite the opposite of being mindless. Husserl distinguishes the analogy:</p><p>Phenomenology carries out its clariÔ¨Åcations in acts of seeing, determining, and distinguishing sense. It compares, it distinguishes, it connects, it places in relation, it divides into parts, it separates off moments. But it does all this in the act of pure seeing. It does not engage in theory or mathematical construction; that is, it offers no explanations in the sense of deductive theories. (Hua II, p. 58; 1999, p. 43)</p><p>The analogy breaks at the methodological requirements. This points also toward different epistemic domains. Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology has a larger epistemic domain than logic, being concerned not only with truth, but also belief. This is where the analogy breaks down. Apodicticity is much larger in scope and stronger in its epistemic claim than truth-preservation.</p><p>Phenomenology, as a method, in some sense, can‚Äôt be separated from agents, the steps aren‚Äôt as clear, and the verification is based on intersubjectivity of other minds. The method seems flawed because it functions in virtue of agents.</p><p>Problematically, Husserl believes objectivity comes from intersubjectivity. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the method infallible, but it makes it much harder to see why it is infallible. Why should we believe that intersubjectivity amounts to objectivity? I don‚Äôt know. A group of phenomenologists may be less fallible than merely an individual phenomenologist, but I see no reason to think together they are infallible. Insofar as the method can be separated from the agents, but I don‚Äôt really understand what it means to separate this method its practitioners. Perhaps in the most theoretical sense, phenomenology may be infallible, but the practice does not appear infallible ‚Äì it may never, practically speaking, lead us to apodictic beliefs.</p><p>In the end, I‚Äôm much more sympathetic to phenomenology without apodicticity. A healthy amount of doubt, and relatively strong justification (but not absolute), is prudent and fruitful.</p><p>It is thus a bit harder for us to see why this is as rigorous as logic. Phenomenology, as Husserl lays it out, is supposed to lead us to apodictic belief, but the method seems mushy.</p><p>And, what does this hold for the nature of knowledge in general. He says:</p><p>Knowledge can be characterized as an identification or synthesis between that which is intended and that which is given (Hua 19/539, 566), and truth as an identity between the meant and the given (Hua 19/651-652).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button></p><p>Note that Husserl need not resort to truth-correspondence theory, as this synthetic relationship may exist between two intentional acts, which don‚Äôt require correspondence to anything external or factual in the world.</p><p>A claim is true as long as it can be intuitively fulfilled, and not only when it is actually fulfilled.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button></p><p>Normally, we think of certainty not as a property of truth, but rather as a property of belief. The subject is certain of a belief. The belief corresponds in some way to truth, and so on. Metaphysically-based paradigms of mind and truth, however, may not hold in Husserlian philosophy, particularly as his work sets out to destroy metaphysics.</p><p>This conception of apodicticity is more than an agent‚Äôs incorrigible attitude towards a belief or truth,</p><p>The apodictic science, as Husserl saw it, was supposed to be like the other science in some ways. Phenomenologists need a community to continue this endless quest for apodictic truths. One person couldn‚Äôt find all apodictic truths by themselves, they need other scientists to help them. Phenomenologists would pass on their knowledge to others, as the natural sciences do, in order for the work to continue.</p><p>The apodictic science was supposed to be analogous to the natural science in terms of confirmation. In natural sciences, journals and communities work together to confirm the validity of one scientist‚Äôs claims and findings ‚Äì only through group confirmation is any theory considered to have merit. The apodictic science, as Husserl set it out, is similar in some respects. There is supposed to be a confirmation.</p><p>This is odd, however. The sort of truths with which the natural sciences deal with are very much subject to doubt, that is the very reason why a confirmation community exists. If apodicticity is as strong as Husserl initially led us to believe, then this confirmation community seems unnecessary. If confirmation is actually important, then it seems that</p><p>What is Apodictic truth?</p><p>What were Husserl‚Äôs definitions? Where did he stray?</p><p>What is Apodictic science?</p><p>Truth-preservation is analogous to apodictic-preservation.</p><p>Apodictic truth is not like the difference between necessary and contingent truths in modal logic. Necessary truths are always true, but they</p><p>In the apodictic science, we move from apodictic truths to apodictic truths.</p><p>Certainty is not merely a feeling about my belief. ‚ÄúHusserl himself explicitly criticizes the so-called feelings of evidence for being psychological fictions (Hua 3/46, 334) and for leading straight to relativism. One can have feelings of certainty about virtually everything, and for that reason any reference to them is useless as a criterion or even definition of truth (Hua 24/156, 2/59, 18/183).‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> 8</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> 8</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">3 : </span> 13</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">4 : </span> ‚Äô (Hua I, p. 55; 1977, p. 15)</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">5 : </span> Hopp, 4</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">6 : </span> Hopp 1</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">7 : </span> 31</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">8 : </span> 32</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">9 : </span> 32</sub></p></div>
