<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Left my assassin on overnight, Clone spawned. She wrecked him. It still required potions, but it wasn't awful this time. The Anni charm sucked. I'm going to keep farming for a perfect one. Also, since I'm rune rich now, I upped Gore riders. Huge increase in base damage. </p><p>I moved onto farming runes again.</p><p>Okay, something is wrong here. I can't be this lucky. There is something wrong about the math I've read about this process. It takes ~900 runs to be able to average (including cubing up) an Ist. I'm averaging an Ist at least every 100 runs, if not better. I do not understand. I'm now approaching 4 Ists total runes within 17 Keys of Terror (less than 250 runs). Most people have to do 4 times the work I've done so far to even cube up to a single Ist. Something is wrong in a very good way. There are 3 options:</p><ol><li>I'm just that lucky. Again, I am doubtful.</li><li>My executable is altered. Somehow the Countess is bugged or the PlugY is responsible. PlugY is notorious for not changing this. It is possible Countess was modified, but nothing else. I think this is unlikely.</li><li>My gear/merc + kill process is different than the average players + the math I've read is wrong.<ul><li>This seems most likely. I'm running with my Orballer and letting static+TS+merc actually take the countess. With Insight in a Cryptic, it only takes a couple seconds. I'm wearing 200% MF, and my merc 25%. MF shouldn't have any impact. It doesn't anywhere else in rune hunting. Perhaps my level matters? Perhaps letting the merc make the kill matters? </li></ul></li></ol><p>Nevermind. I found it:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://forums.d2jsp.org/topic.php?t=73823833&amp;f=21&amp;v=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://forums.d2jsp.org/topic.php?t=73823833&amp;f=21&amp;v=1</a></li></ul><p>Drop rates are about 4 times better, it seems, in 1.13b (which I take myself to be playing in). I have been lucky still, but it's far more believable. So...doing the math, assuming I've just been lucky (and can't count on that), it takes about 4 hours to find an Ist (but, that doesn't feel right either), including all the upkeep, cubing, stash-work, starting games, and the runs themselves. My runs today have been lucky, but just not as lucky. It seems I was right on all three counts to some degree. I have been lucky, the executable had to be different than I expected (but that is a truism), and the math I read was wrong (since it was 1.10 math).</p><p>My haul today:</p><ul><li>2 Ist</li><li>3 Mal</li><li>2 Pul</li><li>1 Fal</li><li>4 Ko (2 Cubed)</li></ul><p>I am very glad I've been saving gems from the beginning. I wish I had saved all the gems and cubed nothing except the flawless. I really need chipped and flawed now. I'm completely out of chipped topazes (as usual). I'm now just saving Thul's in bulk because I'm clearly never going to have enough chipped topazes. </p><p>Also, I'm thinking I should make Call to Arms. It needs 9 Ists worth of Runes, basically. That's 36 hours. It's a huge buff for 6 characters, just a straight gain almost across the board. The barb still would use it too, since it is raw improvement as well. In terms of survivability, it might be the single strongest item in the game (well, Engima teleport is also very strong). It's an obvious item to have. What's best for all my characters? This one. Building a Grief is really only good for a smiter. I don't want to waste my time/runes. Wish I could make Infinity because that mother fucker is strong! 2 Ber's would take me forever to make though.</p><p>Upped my Eth Shaftstop. About 1 in 10 Countess encounters push him hard. The extra defense is hard to beat. </p><p>Now I will think about what items I need to actually be picking up. What whites, sockets, magics, and rares are worth my time? </p><p>Hit level 89 on the sorc today. It will take 1337 runs (at 100k xp per run) to hit 90. =)</p><p>I'm calling it a night.</p><p>I now have 20 keys. That averages out to be something like ~280 runs. That actually sounds low to me. Perhaps my key drop rate is too low? I don't know. I'm guessing here. I'm getting an Ist-worth of runes about every 47 runs. Faster than one Ist per hour...that's pretty fucking fast. Faster than I thought it was. Before, my match was showing I was getting 16 times what I expect to get, and now I'm getting times what I was expecting to get. Something is still wrong. I don't know what though, and I'm going to stop worrying about it. I don't think I've played 16 hours worth; but I'd believe 6-10. Maybe it is right. Hrmm...</p></div>
