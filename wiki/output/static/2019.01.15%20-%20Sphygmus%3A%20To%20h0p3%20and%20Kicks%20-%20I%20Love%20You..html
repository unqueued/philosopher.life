<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>At 13, I could barely imagine being 20, much less 24. I cried myself to sleep in bed, wishing to be held, rocked, comforted; wanting to feel less alone and frightened. I thought things would be different as an adult ‚Äì that the loneliness would dissolve and there would be no more tears or salt spots on my glasses. But crying in my bed, covers pulled over my head, feels no different today than it did 11 years ago.</p><p>The feelings are the same: I am wracked by sorrow, by an aching hole in my heart ‚Äì do you sense it? A tightness in my chest, a gap, an empty space, a void in my chest that is dark and terrible and sad. If you are deeply honest, my words resonate ‚Äì you have felt this hole in your own chest. Perhaps this is it: these visceral qualia form the most intense and common language between us all. Kicks, you describe your weeping and we feel it ‚Äì h0p3's stomach turns inside out as he writes to you and I recognize my own insecurities in your feelings of insignificance. As we read the words of Others, our bodies respond with the knowledge and recognition of our deep wounds, our brokenness, our despondence, our faith, our hopes, our excitement; all of our being resonates together. </p><p>I have said in the past that there is an unbridgeable gap between <em>my mind</em> and <em>other minds</em> ‚Äì what are you thinking? what thoughts are running through your mind as you read this? I cannot ever <em>truly</em> know. But I find a space here; we are all animals, and it stands to reason that despite our infinitely different contexts, the physically embodied feelings we experience are deeply common among us. We are all raw feeling in the desert together.</p><p>So ‚Äì I have felt today as I felt at 13, have spiraled into waves of grief and fear and sadness, seemingly without reprieve. If the world is still green and alive, I foresee myself diving into that well at 72. The fear of death will rise as a giant in front of me, the grief of losing friends and loved ones: pain, sadness, and fear. Nothing will have changed ‚Äì in my body I will feel as I have always felt, weeping desolately under the covers.</p><p>Behold - here again I find a space, a freedom, an ease. I am capable of surviving the deluge of feeling. It is a waterfall, roaring over me, and there I sit with the pain pounding through my head and the tension foaming in my heart. I am an adult, my frontal lobe has grown, self-awareness formed and nurtured, and I turn towards the waterfall and embrace it with all the gentle love and honesty in myself. </p><p>When I was 13, I longed eternally for someone to embrace me, to cradle me, to never let me go, to listen to me so intently, and to tell me that everything was going to be alright. Slowly, piece by snail-like-imperfect-piece, I have learned to hold myself. I sit with the waterfall and sit and sit and suddenly the storm has passed and I am alive. </p><p>I have gently begun to heal. I am broken ‚Äì I will never not be broken ‚Äì our brokenness unites and connects us, our fragility, the Human condition. </p><p>And as I hold space for myself, I hold space for others. I will sit with you, Kicks, and feel with you, resonate with you. You may wrestle with me, h0p3, and bump against a wound I did not even know existed, and I will be grateful for the opportunity to mend it. Us broken shards of pottery will totter on together as arm in arm we stitch ourselves and therefore the world together with golden thread.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">mm</sup></button>
