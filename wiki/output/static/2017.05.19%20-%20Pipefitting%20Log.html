<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was good. I studied my last chapter. It's huge. I'll have to take the exam on Monday. </p><p>Before class even started, the teacher had me come into his office. He wanted to tell me that he was thinking on his way back home from school about what he said to me the day before. He wanted to point out (if not reiterate what he said the day before) that without the sockolets, even he couldn't have finished the simulator in 6 hours. Cutting the holes, even with a drill instead of a torch, would have taken far more time. His point was to show me that Keith was talking out of his ass. Also, the books will cost $260. I'm hoping I can find a way to have AB&amp;T pay for them (that reminds me that I should cash my check and mail off my current form).</p><p>Around break time, I went over to Dale's office. He's frankly a better teacher. His students are higher quality too, imho. Pipefitters are definitely a rough bunch. That said, I spent a lot of time just sitting in his office talking and listening. Dale spends a lot of time with his students. He does a lot of the right things. I say a lot a lot.</p><p>Dale didn't want to do 1G. He said to learn 2G (moving horizontally with one plate stacked vertically on top of the other). So, that's what we did. We tacked the plates from the back. Also, don't worry about welding over the tacks on the plate. They cut off the last inch off each side anyway. I tried welding through it, and I couldn't. </p><p>I finally put down my first root under instruction. It was night and day different with a teacher. I had to stick the 6010 rod in there hard. Seriously, like I was pushing my finger into your arm (that's actually what Dale did to show me). The root came out pretty well (the students, my teacher, and Dale agreed). I probably should have pushed even harder. My root could literally pass inspection. It was miles better than anything I had done on my own. Dale's pointers and suggestions were very detailed. There are clearly tons of small things to learn. It's an art. Dale showed me with his own hand as well. After I finished the root and grinding, Dale had his star pupil this year (the state champion) teach me how to drop the hotpass over the root. </p><p>We switched to 7018 rods from 6010. We had to drop the crispness down and turn up the heat a pinch (Dale said it probably could have been a hair hotter too). I had about a 10-degree angle pointing up into the upper part of the root. Many students, particularly the upperclassmen, came to visit my booth. They said it was very good, especially given how little practice I have. Several asked if I was going to be joining them. </p><p>I got to look at another upperclassman's work. I asked him what he liked about his particular weld piece and what he didn't. I think I made him uncomfortable asking, but the champion thought it was a fine question to ask. I hope that I can grow to be more comfortable being honest with myself about my own mistakes and learning from them. How else can I master this with what little time and as few resources as I have?</p><p>Dale came by to look at my hotpass. He said it was very good a couple times, although he thinks I should have sped up. I moved too slowly (I think I can fix this easily enough). I also have to make sure that it doesn't droop down and create a tiny trench or pocket on the bottom for slag to hide in. In time, I may get this down. I really hope to soak up as much as I can from Dale. I asked tons and tons of questions today, particularly targeting Dale and his star pupil. I don't have the benefit of time and practice that these guys have. I can't expect too much of myself here. I need to do my best and be pleased with whatever I can achieve.</p><p>What if I spent extra time after school with Dale to learn to weld? 30 minutes every day would go a really long fucking way. I'll need to find out what his class' schedule is like; this may not even be possible. Maybe I can ask my teacher to let me go over there 30 minutes each day. My teacher made the jokingish comment that I was betraying him by trying to learn to weld, although he has encouraged me in many ways to do this.</p></div>
