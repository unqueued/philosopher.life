I.e. a Referring expression.</p><p>Individual constants are part of the set of all Terms. Individual constants are simple terms.</p><p>There are two types of terms. 1.) Simple (individual constants), and 2.) Complex.</p><p>Complex terms are the results of function symbols applied to a term. Obviously, complexity ranges.</p><p>Father(gwb) is different from father(gwb). Note the difference in capitalization. Both are well-formed expressions in our formal language, but they are very different. The latter is a function, also a complex term. Its job is to refer. The former contains a predicate (and a subject); it is an atomic sentence. It has a truth value.</p><p>‚ÄúA is a cube‚Äù can be written as Cube(a).</p><p>‚ÄúC is between a and d‚Äù can be written as Between(c, a, d). Choosing the order of terms matters, particularly as these are related in the sentence. When translating, try to stay as close as possible to the surface grammar that you are translating. So, while Between(c, d, a) is also true, Between(c, a, d) matches the original grammar better.</p><p>From 1.12:</p><p>Claire‚Äôs father is taller than Max‚Äôs father.</p><p>John is Max‚Äôs father. (Apparently, better than ‚ÄúJohn is identical to Max‚Äôs father‚Äù)</p><p>Claire is taller than her maternal grandmother.</p><p>Max‚Äôs maternal grandmother is taller than his paternal grandmother.</p><p>Melanie and Claire have the same mother.</p><p>Argument = a collection of statements, one of which is called the conclusion. It is intended to follow from (be a consequence of) or be supported by the remaining statements. The remaining sentences are known as the premises.</p><p>There are signals in normal English for which argumentative sentences are which.</p><p>Conclusion: therefore, thus, hence, so</p><p>Premises: since, after all, because</p><p>All humans are Mortal. Socrates is human. So, Socrates is Mortal.</p><p>Lucretius is human. After all, all humans are mortal and Lucretius is mortal.</p><p>Fitch format down below. Note the ‚Äúfitch bar‚Äù which separates the premises from the conclusion.</p><p>| All humans are mortal.</p><p>| Socrates is human.</p><p>|‚Äî</p><p>| Socrates is mortal.</p><p>| All humans are mortal.</p><p>| Lucretius is mortal.</p><p>|‚Äî</p><p>| Lucretius is human.</p><p>(Obviously, 2 isn‚Äôt valid)</p><p>An argument is logically (aka, deductively) valid iff (if and only if) its conclusion must be true if its premises are true. Thus, it is also impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.</p><p>The conclusion of a logically valid argument is said to be a logical consequence of the argument‚Äôs premises.</p><p>Logical consequence and Logical validity are brothers.</p><p>Modal logics have to do with possibility and necessity. You must think about whether or not it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, independent of the actual truth or falsity.</p><p>Actual worlds and possible worlds (possible truth values).</p><p>George Bush is President and Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State. Therefore, Hillary Rodham Clinton is Secretary of State.</p><p>If you suppose the premise is true, then the conclusion MUST be true. This is logically valid. Notice that the premise is actually false, but the conclusion is true.</p><p>All humans are mortal. Obama is human. Therefore, Obama is mortal.</p><p>Valid. Actual truth values: true as well.</p><p>All humans are mortal. Obama is immortals. Therefore Obama is not human.</p><p>Valid. 1 premise and 1 conclusion is actually false though.</p><p>Logical validity and actual truth values do not track each other.</p><p>Moving from actually true premises to an actually false conclusion is time where ‚Äútracking‚Äù can show the invalidity of an argument.</p><p>An argument is ‚Äúsound‚Äù iff both 1.) it is logically valid and 2.) its premises are all true.</p><p>True in, true out = Truth preservation.</p><p>Soundness is practical.</p><p>Notes ‚Äì September 2, 2010</p><p>A proof is a step by step demonstration that one statement (say S) is a logical consequence of some statements (say p1,‚Ä¶.,pn).</p><p>Note that individual statements can easily prove themselves.</p><p>Formal Proofs must be in a formal language using explicitly specified rules.</p><p>Informal Proofs do not necessarily need explicitly specified rules and methods.

Good translation preserves meaning. It must match as closely as possible. Meaning of a statement are its truth conditions. Truth conditions are the circumstances under which the statement is true. You are looking for logical equivalence between that which is translated and the translation.

A translation of a sentence S1 into a sentence S2 is correct if S1 and S2 have the same truth conditions.

Any possible situation (not just one or some) in which one is true the other is true as well. (Logically equivalent)



Stylistic considerations:

    Match the surface syntax as closely as possible.

    Maximize naturalness (even colloquial)



    Not either/Neither, Nor ~(P v Q)

    Either not ~P v ~Q

    Not both ~(P ^ Q)

    Both not ~P ^ ~Q

1 and 4 are equivalent; 2 and 3 are equivalent.



    Neither e nor a is to the right of and to the left of b.

~((Rightof(e, c) ^ Leftof(e, b)) v (Rightof(a, c) ^ Leftof(a, b))

    Either a is small or both c and d are large.

Small(a) v (Large(c) ^ Large(d))

~C(m) v ~C(p)



~, ^, v - these are truth-functional connectives. The truth values of the atomics of a sentence containing Boolean connectives define the truth value of those connectives.

It is necessarily the case that (or, ‚Äúit is necessary‚Äù) ‚Äì modal operators. Beyond truth value of the sentence in the actual world, but even possible worlds. This isn‚Äôt a truth-functional connective. The word ‚Äúbecause‚Äù, likewise, isn‚Äôt a truth-functional connective because it depends on more than the current truth values of the atomics in the sentence using the word ‚Äúbecause‚Äù.



Logical Statuses (Stati?, Stats?):

Logical consequence

Logical truth

Logical equivalence



Truth Tables help define the Statuses?

A sentence S is a logical truth iff it is logically impossible for S to be false. Aka. Necessary Truth (and Logically necessary truth).

A = A

Tet(a) v ~Tet(a)



Physical Possibility: doesn‚Äôt violate physical law

TW Possibility (Tarski World Possibility) ÔÉüspecific to our book: can be built within the Tarski block world.

Facts:

    Every TW-possible sentence is logically possible.

    Some logically possible sentences are not TW-possible.

        ~(Tet(b) v Dedec(b) v Cube(b)) (e.g. can‚Äôt make a sphere)



Truth Table for a Sentence: A truth table for a sentence P is an arrangement of truth values that shows the truth value of P in every possible situation as determined by the truth values of the atomic sentences occurring in P.

Main Connective: The main connective of a non-atomic sentence is that connective such that no other connective operates on a larger (i.e., more complex) part of the sentence than it does.

S, Q are true; R is False

Something which is false is every situation is necessarily false or contradiction.

Every logically necessary sentence is TW-Necessary.



Convention for truth tables on chained ‚Äúor‚Äù or ‚Äúand‚Äù is to group from the left

(((A ^ B) ^ C) ^ D) ^ E



Every tautology is logically necessary.

Some logical necessities are not tautologies.



Truth tables are insensitive to ‚Äúlarger‚Äù or Identity statements. They can‚Äôt show all logically necessary statements because of this, only tautologies.



TT=Truth Table



A sentence S is TT-possible iff S is true on at least one row of its truth table.



TT-Possible is ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù or internally consistent, but this is only a subspecies of ‚Äúconsistencies‚Äù

TT-Necessary = Tautology

TT-Impossible=Contradiction



Joint truth table: a truth table built for more than one sentence.



A B || ~(A ^ B) | ~A v ~B

T T || F T | F F F

T F || T F | F T T

F T || T F | T T F

F F || T F | T T T



Compare the truth values of each sub-table.



The above table shows that both sentences are tautologically equivalent because they agree (have the same truth value) on every row under the main connective in their truth table.

Tautological equivalence is a subspecies of logical equivalence.



Truth tables tell you about the meanings of truth-functional connectives, which is why we can see proofs of tautology in TTs.



Every Tautological equivalent pair of sentences is logically equivalent.

Some logically equivalent pairs are not tautologically equivalent pairs.



S is a logical truth iff S is a logical consequence of any set of sentences.

S and S‚Äô are logically equivalent iff S is a logical consequence of S‚Äô and vice versa.



TT give us a way to define the notion of tautological consequence.

S is a tautological consequence of P1‚Ä¶Pn iff the joint truth table for S and P1‚Ä¶Pn has no row where each of the P‚Äôs is true and S is false.



Tautological consequence is a subspecies of logical consequence.



Tautology = Truth Table = Truth-functional connectives relationships are fully understood/described



Tautological consequence, equivalence, and truth relate to each other in the same that way Logical consequence, equivalence, and truth relate to themselves.



Tautological consequence relates to logical consequence in the same way that Tautological equivalence relates to logical equivalence in the same way that Tautological truth relates to logical truth.





Notes ‚Äì September 21



Any instance of tautological consequence is an instance of logical consequence.



Some instances of logical consequences are not instances of tautological consequence. E.g. a=b &amp; b=c, therefore a=c. This is a logical consequence, but not tautological consequence because tautological consequence can be captured in truth tables and can only use truth-connectives. Some logical consequence use non-truth-connectives.



S is a tautology iff S is a tautological consequence of any set of premises.



S and S‚Äô are tautologically equivalent iff S and S‚Äô are tautological consequences of each other.



Chapter 5



An inference step is a move from one or more sentences to a sentence in a process or pattern of reasoning. E.g. P ^ Q -&gt; P



Valid inference step just in case it is truth preserving. If the sentences you start from in the inference step, then so must the sentence you step to (the outcome of that inference step). Truth in, truth out; Truth preserving.



3 Simple valid inference steps:



    From a conjunction of any number of sentences, one may infer any one of the conjuncts.

From P1 ^ P2 ^ Pn, infer Pi (where ‚Äòi‚Äô is between 1 and ‚Äòn‚Äô)

Conjunction Elim rule (^ Elim)

    From any number of sentences, one may infer the conjunction of these sentences.

From truth of all of P1, P2, Pn -&gt; infer P1 ^ P2 ^ Pn

Conjunction intro rule (^ Intro)

    From any sentence, one may infer a disjunction of any number of sentences containing that sentence as a disjunct.

From P, infer P v Q, P v Z, P v Q v Z v S

Disjunction intro rule (v Intro)



Every step of a proof (formal or informal) should be easily understandable and significant.

Easily understood -&gt; Easy to see the step is valid. Obviously, this is audience sensitive.

Significance must move the proof forward (metaphorically speaking).



Proof by Cases.

(Cube(c) ^ Small(c)) v (Tet(c) ^ Small(c))

‚Äì

Small(c)



p.f.. Sp‚Äô (Cube(c) ^ Small(c)) v (Tet(c) ^ Small(c))

Show: Small(c)

There are two cases to consider.



Case 1 ‚Äì Cube(c) ^ Small(c) -&gt; Small(c)

Case 2 ‚Äì Tet(c) ^ Small(c) -&gt; Small(c)

This exhausts the possibilities. So, Small(c)



Proof by Cases: To prove S from P1 v P2 v Pn: Show that S is a consequence of each Pi (where ‚Äòi‚Äô is between 1 and ‚Äòn‚Äô)

Proof by Cases is specific to disjunctions. Proof by cases underwrites disjunction elimination (v Elim)



Notes ‚Äì September 23, 2010

To prove S from P1 v P2 v Pn, prove S from each Pi

Indirect proof/proof by contradiction/ reduction ad absurdum

To prove ~S from sentence P1...Pn, assume S and derive a contradiction.

Contradiction = a sentence which is necessarily false.

P1 T

. T

Pn T

S ?

‚Äì

X F

Thus, S must necessarily be false. We know which one to blame, since the P‚Äôs are already taken to be true in this study, only S is left, and it must be False. QED, ~S is true!

Contradiction must be necessarily false from these.



Show: B != C follows from Cube(c) v Dodec(c), and Tet(b).

Assume:

Cube(c) v Dodec(c)

Tet(b)

Assume for reductio that b = c. (I,e, ~[b!=c])

Since Cube(c) v Dodec(c), there are two cases to consider.

Case 1: Cube(c) ÔÉ† Then we have Cube(c) and Tet(b). But, since b=c, we have a Tet(c). It is impossible for Cube(c) and Tet(c) to be true at the same time.

Case 2: Dodec(c) ÔÉ† Then we have Dodec(c) and Tet(b). But, since b=c, we have Tet(c). It is impossible for Dodec(c) and Tet(c) to be true at the same time.

Since this exhausts the cases, the premises plus b=c lead to impossibility. So, b!=c

This is an inconsistent set.

‚ä•: Absurd, Surd, bottom, falsity, the false, contradiction

Fact: S is a contradiction iff ~S is a logical truth

Not deductively valid, where is the counterexample?

Consider a world in which e is a small dodec and f is a cube.

The First premise is true in this world, since e is a dodec.

The Second premise is also true in this world, since e is small.

The Third premise is true in this world, since e is small and Small(e) is one of the disjuncts of this premise.

But, the conclusion is false in this world because f is not a dodec.

    Proofs/Counterexample



Material Condition - ‚Üí

If P, then Q

P only if Q

Q if P

Q if only P

Q provided that P

P is sufficient for Q

Q is necessary for P

The above are written as: P ÔÉ† Q



Syntax for ÔÉ†

If P and Q are sentences, then so is PÔÉ†Q

This is called a conditional.

Within a conditional, such as P ÔÉ† Q, P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.



Semantics for ÔÉ†

P ÔÉ† Q is true if either P is false or Q is true.

P Q | P ÔÉ† Q

T T | T

T F | F

F T | T

F F | T



Notice how the only time P ÔÉ† Q is false is when P is true and Q is false. False P will always make P ÔÉ† Q true.



If Max had been at home, then Carl would have been there too. (This isn‚Äôt a material condition because the antecedent is false, and the entire conditional is false, which is not possible according to the truth table for material conditional).

Indicative mood and subjunctive mood will demonstrate which English sentences are material conditionals and which aren‚Äôt.



P unless Q ‚Äì this is written as - ~Q ÔÉ† P

Ted will die unless Bob helps him.

If Bob doesn‚Äôt help him, Ted will die.

~Helps(bob, ted) ÔÉ† Dies(ted)



Corresponding Conditional (Associated conditional)

With any argument, you can write a conditional which corresponds to it.

|P1

|P2

|.

|Pn

|-

| C

(P1 ^ P2 ^ ‚Ä¶ ^ Pn) ÔÉ† C



An argument is deductively valid iff its corresponding conditional is a logical truth.



Material Biconditional - ‚Üî

P iff Q

P just in case Q

P is necessary and sufficient for Q

P ‚Üî Q

P and Q are logically equivalent iff P ‚Üî Q is a logical truth.



Syntax for ‚Üî

If P and Q are sentences, then so is P ‚Üî Q



Semantics for ‚Üî

P ‚Üî Q is true iff the truth values of P and Q match



P Q | P ‚Üî Q

T T | T

T F | F

F T | F

F F | T

Where they match, obviously, the biconditional is true. Where they don‚Äôt have matching truth values, this statement is false. Material biconditionals have the same truth values and are logically equivalent.



P ‚Üî Q is logically equivalent to (P ÔÉ† Q) ^ (Q ÔÉ† P)



Conversational implicatur

(from Paul Grice)

Sometimes you communicate things in a sentence which aren‚Äôt a part of its truth conditions.

‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs great, he‚Äôs never drunk on Thursdays.‚Äù This implies he‚Äôs drunk the rest of the time.

It is conversationally implied, but not logically implied.

This should be kept in mind when translating natural language into formal language.

Any part of what is communicated by a speaker in asserting S that can be canceled out by the speaker‚Äôs elaborating on what she without contradicting herself is an implicature of S and not part of S‚Äôs truth conditions.

[‚àÄxP(x)] is true iff [P(a1) &amp; P(a2) &amp; ‚Ä¶&amp; P(ak)] is true.

Likewise, with negations:
