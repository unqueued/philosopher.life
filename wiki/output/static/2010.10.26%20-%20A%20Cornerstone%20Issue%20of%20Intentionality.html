<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Brandom discusses two contemporary ‚Äòepisodes‚Äô in the development of the philosophy of intentionality. The first episode is the intensionality of intentionality. One response to (problems of) the intensionality of intentionality is a naturalistic account which describes intentionality through ‚Äúcounterfactuals used to codify causal relationships.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> The second episode, which I hope to explore a bit further, is the normativity of intentionality.</p><p>Brandom frames intentionality as being innately normative in nature, as if we can‚Äôt make sense of what it means to have a concept or to move towards something without some objective standard by which to judge correctness. He explains:</p><p>[A]nything recognizable as an intentional state‚Ä¶must underwrite normative assessments as to whether things are as they ought to be, according to that state‚Äîwhether the state is correct or successful according to the standards determined by its content. Believing includes committing oneself, undertaking a responsibility concerning how things are (how they might be found to be).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button></p><p>I think he uses very strong words to explain the normativity of intentionality. In particular, notions of an agent‚Äôs commitment and responsibility are forceful metaethical claims about the nature of minds. I find these to be profound foundational requirements for an account of intentionality because they involve choice. To ‚Äòcommit‚Äô or to be held ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô for something entails that an agent has made a choice, one for which values must be compared and judged. It sounds as if intentional beings are moral beings. I admire that, although I think there are a lot of implications to saying it. Attributions of intentionality carry even more weight, in my view, if they are the sorts which are morally normative. Brandom continues his argument:</p><p>Crudely put, one cannot take what is represented by a state or performance to consist simply in what stimuli the system in question is disposed to respond to by entering that state or producing that performance. For that would leave no room for mistaken responses, for misinterpretation. Whatever the use of a concept takes to be correct would be correct.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button></p><p>If normativity is subjective, then the account of intentionality may only be descriptive. Brandom believes the normativity of intentionality isn‚Äôt subjective. He wants an account which makes sense of being wrong about our intentions. I think he‚Äôs right. Leaving no room for making mistakes isn‚Äôt a plausible account of what it means to possess a concept, to think, to reason, to commit oneself, to be about something, or to move towards something - these all seem to be things for which we can be mistaken or do ineffectively. I think denying the ability to be wrong, in an objective sense, also takes away from the specialness of when an agent ‚Äògets it right‚Äô.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Brandom, Robert. 2001. ‚ÄúModality, Normativity, and Intentionality.‚Äù Philosophy and Phenomenological Research LXIII, 589</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> 589</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">3 : </span> 591</sub></p></div>
