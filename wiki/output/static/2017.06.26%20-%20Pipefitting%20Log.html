<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was uplifting. I was the only student there today, but my teacher was there. We talked, and instead of studying, I said I wanted to work in the shop (I will get through the tests). In particular, I wanted to build a fit-up bar for myself. He said I shouldn't try to make my own since it really needs to be made of hardened steel. I thought about welding it instead, but I realized that may not work either (but why not? It seems like it should; welds are very strong).</p><p>I told my teacher about my visit to the union. It was my preface to working on pipe welding. I have basically no practice at it, and it would be a wise step. He agreed, and he said he would try contacting Jacobs again for me. </p><p>I went about my business. I cut some pipe, beveled, and started welding. I've been putting landings on these pipes, and it makes a difference. I don't think I put a full 1/8&quot; gap between them though, and that bit me in the butt. That said, I still burned plenty of holes. The rotation is much harder than just plain plate. I think I could improve significantly with plenty of practice. There were acceptable parts of my root. The filler was fine. The caps were not good. Parts of them were just fine, but my directional control and my tie-ins sucked. Practice!</p><p>All-in-all, I did 3 pipes today. Good enough. </p><p>Towards the end of the day, an interesting flurry of events happened. My teacher said he had spoken with the welding teacher, Dale, and they had a job for me to consider. They sent a picture of my simulator work, and the company loved it. The only problem is that the job is 3 hours away from me in Charlotte, NC. It's a permanent job. I'd have to commute, live in someone else's house for several days a week, and then head back home. Basically, it would only be worth it if I could work 3 days at 13 hours a piece or four 10's, or maybe even overtime if I'm lucky (I'd need to show them what I'm made of first). I'd need to make it worth my while.</p><p>So, I wrote a cover letter (borrowed from what I had), explained my situation, and sent my resume to the guy. He responded and quickly asked how much I wanted. I told him I wanted $22.50 an hour (I knew the top-end was $25 for this job, and that would be for a journeyman, I take it).</p><p>They called me while I was pushing out bricks. My connection was bad. We lost connection twice (once after I left the bathroom), and so I just asked my teacher for his landline. The interview went well. They decided they might be able to do $20 an hour for me because I have zero field experience. They said after 60 days they would revisit my pay and likely offer me a significant jump in pay (Dale confirmed this as well). This will at least give me experience for the union. Also, I asked if I could learn to weld, specifically TIG pipewelding while there. They said they could work that out with me. I also talked a bit about Chris. I said I would try and help him too.</p><p>They talked to Dale and I was given high praise. I am glad to have the recommendations of my teachers. I thanked them both. It worked out. Now I need to see how I can manage to find a way to get the $2k allocated to me from AB&amp;T and actually use it. I also need to see about getting access to my Eth. Every dollar counts.</p><p>I start July 10th! I take my drug test and do the paperwork. I believe I start working for real the next day. My wife and I are working on living arrangements. There are some scheduling conflicts now for my wife's travel plans for work. We're getting that sorted as well. I need to make sure the car is in decent enough shape for this as well. We're going to save for a vehicle. I'm going to shoot for a van. I'd like to be able to just live in my van. I could save a solid $400 a month that way, and I would be prepared for the next step, which I assume will be the union. Then I will be prepared for traveling and saving every dollar I can. If I'm going to spend time away from my family, I'm going to make it count. </p><p>Assuming this all works out, I will still join the union. I may be covertly working inside the union (I'm not sure if I'm going to pay dues or not) while gaining experience in this company and putting ourselves into good financial standing. If I can get the stars to align, the goal is to walk into the union as a 4th-year apprentice. Then, it would take me, hopefully, a year to hit Journeyman pipefitter and pick up my welding certifications (assuming I've been practicing diligently for the next 1.5 years). After that, I can pick up my valve certifications within a year. Journeyman pipefitter, pipewelder, and valve specialist in 3 years. It is possible that I could learn Plumbing and HVAC in a very short amount of time as well, but if I'm going with valves, why go that route? Plumbing is something I can do on my own, building my own company, but perhaps being a valve specialist would be the same way. In any case, I just might be able to do it. It is possible that 2.5 years from now I will have significant mobility, having the money to buy a house wherever we want and work near any major city. </p><p>Towards the end of the day, before I left, my teacher asked me a personal question. He asked me &quot;how someone loses their faith,&quot; referencing our previously personal conversation from months ago. He was genuinely curious. I tried to explain my upbringing and reason-based approach to faith. I don't think it clicked for him, lol.</p><p>Lastly, I still should contact the Boilermakers and the Electrician union. It is possible I could have local work at the same pay. I'll keep looking for pipefitting jobs around Johnson City as well. Why not?</p></div>
