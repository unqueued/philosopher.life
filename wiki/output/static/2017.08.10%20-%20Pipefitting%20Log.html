<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was generally another &quot;thrilling&quot; day of trying to look busy and keep out of sight and out of trouble. My foreman is shepherding us all to do this; it's not a copout. Multiple teams seem to be struggling to have work to do directly because we don't have what we need to move on in this project. </p><p>I had a chance to review our tie-in sheet and do a full walk around. (David) Mull was happy to hand me a map to do the studying. I can't tell if he cares about my input or even if I'm thinking about this job. I asked for information at the morning meeting, and he said he would get it to me. He saw what I had, and gave me the next piece to the puzzle. So, maybe he does? </p><p>I also used my tape measure (or let my journeyman do it). I took notes in the notebook (I really need to open my tools and bring my own), for my foreman. </p><p>Also, I'm kind of confused about this job so far. I obviously stick out like a sore thumb. As long as I am competent and polite, I hope they will see I'm worth keeping and cultivating or at least give me a good reference.</p><p>Anyways, I made a map of the work zone, and I've gone through all the tie-ins and their requirements. I have an understanding of what this structure looks like, about 1-2 steps behind what my Foreman seems to know. They are still engineering this, and that's part of why we are waiting on our shop-fabricated parts. Field pipefitting, clearly, is really quite different from a fab shop. </p><p>I should spend time in a fab shop. I need to see about getting to a local fab shop at the end of this job. I know they are laying everyone off at the end now, or at least me and my journeyman (or so he claims); this is the norm for this discipline it seems. </p><p>Finding a permanent job in town seems really hard to beat. I should ask my teacher about Jacob's fabrication shop. They get lots of hours, they may be local, and I think I would be very strong with practice. I'm happy to be a pipefitting helper for as long as they'd like (especially if I was paid decently like I am now). I want them to give me the chance to show I can do it alongside a mentor. I'll work for free even. I believe I could become a fabrication shop master very easily, but I am not so sure I would excel in the way in the field. </p><p>Recall, of course, that you should see all pipefitters as networking tools and competition. Guard information wisely. Reach out, maintain contacts, and bootstrap from rung to rung. Make friends when you can, and maintain bridges otherwise.</p><p>So, after the job, I could just ask the fab shop to give me two weeks at minimum wage. I want to prove to them after 2 weeks that I'm worth hiring for a real wage. Try to get a job first, but this is a foot-in-the-door in a pinch. Perhaps with a good reference, they might make an opening for me.</p><p>I should bring treats for the crew on Monday! The guy who brings bagels is often loved (although, some will hate him). That's the guy I should be. Global Suckass! Do it! Delicious.</p><p>Also, Chris and I talk a lot together on this job. I'm glad to get to know him better, and he doesn't seem to mind my oddness so much. It's nice to be able to feel a bit more normal and myself around him than I do others.</p><p>When David and Mull talk, I fear that I sometimes don't immediately understand what they mean. Sometimes this is a terminology problem, but there are other knowledge and experiential differences. I need to pay attention and learn as much as I can. Finding times where I have something interesting to say to Mull would be very useful. </p><p>Should I save my ideas for him? In a way, he is the reference I need.</p></div>
