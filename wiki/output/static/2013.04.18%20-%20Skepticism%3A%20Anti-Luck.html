<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Not Accidental JTB:
-reliable (not necessarily infallible) - externalist
-to some extent, know how and why you know - internalist</p><p>They both want the same thing, right? The reason the externalist wants agents to know &quot;how and why you know&quot; is because that results in reliability often. The reason the internalist wants reliability is because it is the result of know &quot;how and why you know.&quot; You don't really know &quot;how and why you know&quot; if you aren't reliable. </p><p>Beliefs in necessary truths are infallible, hence reliable; we just need the internal story to it, which shouldn't be too hard. Almost always inferential.</p><p>Beliefs in contingent truths can be reliable. What does it mean for a truth to be contingent? it means there is a probability greater than 0 that the truth values are different. It could have otherwise. </p><p>To know a contingent truth, C, </p><p>One could be merely reliable in believing C. Maybe C, contingently, has a 80% of being true. Maybe my reliable method has a 90% chance of leading me to C. My method has a 72% of leading me to the right answer. </p><hr><p>I don't understand the newspaper example in the Lottery paradox. Something seems fishy about it to me. My claim is this: the newspaper is not a source of knowledge if the mathematical odds (be definition having a higher chance of being correct in this example) aren't, and in all likelihood, with respect to a lottery of magnitude, the newspaper isn't a source of knowledge as Pritchard believes.</p><p>Pritchard has a strong intuition that ‚Äúeven though this belief is justified and true...it is not a case of knowledge. I think, ultimately, Pritchard has a strong intuition that JTB based solely upon probabilistic justification cannot result in knowledge. Why should we agree? Can this be right?</p><p>What seems weird to me is that Pritchard thinks it is reasonable to believe: ‚Äúit seems that evidence of a certain kind can sometimes suffice for knowledge even though, surprisingly, stronger evidence would not suffice.‚Äù I'm not saying this must be wrong, but I have strong intuitions which go against it.</p><p>At first, I thought this was a temporal issue, where the agent forms her belief that &quot;X is a losing ticket&quot; BEFORE there is a resulting winner, while in the case of the newspaper, the agent forms her belief that &quot;X is a losing ticket&quot; AFTER there is a resulting winner. But, this can't be the problem. Back to the odds, maybe the agent could form her belief AFTER the resulting winner, but before the hearing the Lottery admin, qua the odds. Prediction is not the problem.</p><p>Importantly, the newspaper's report is probabilistically correct, just like the mathematical odds. There is always a chance the newspaper will get it wrong. Maybe they mistyped; maybe they misheard the Lottery administrator's announcement of the results; maybe it was a prank; maybe Fox news bought the newspaper...whatever. The fact is that newspapers are fallible. In a sense, the newspaper is ‚Äúpredicting‚Äù the winner, since it cannot infallibly report who won.</p><p>We have A's prediction of Z and B's prediction of Z. Assume A's prediction of Z has a higher chance of being correct than B's. As far as I can tell, any rational person who knows all and only these assumptions should use A's prediction.</p><p>Let's say this is a 1,000 ticket lottery. Let's say the Lottery admin uses a computer to report the results, and this computer is the accurate in its reporting 99% of the time, and fails 1% of the time. The Lottery admin puts the result in, and the computer reports/broadcasts the result. When the computer says, &quot;X won the lottery,&quot; there is a 99% chance that it is true. Would you believe the odds or the computer? Surely the odds. How is the newspaper any different? It isn't.</p><p>The newspaper is not as reliable as the odds. Why should we trust the newspaper over the odds in the first place? You shouldn't!</p><p>Think about it. I assume the odds of the Newspaper getting it wrong are astronomical, and of course, we can think of a Lottery with enough tickets to over come these odds ‚Äì it would be a ridiculous lottery. Why should you trust the newspaper on something so astronomically unlikely? You shouldn't.</p><p>You need more than just one newspaper. You need multiple sources. That's what responsible epistemic agents do! When considering a highly improbably thing occurring, you don't just verify it solely based upon Al Jazeera; you read and verify with RT, Reuters, BBC, etc. If it is improbable enough, like a lottery, you need to call the Lottery admins; you need to verify from multiple angles before you commit yourself to believing something so wildly against the odds.</p><p>The point is that the odds of all of these sources of evidence being wrong at the same time are lower than the odds of winning the lottery. That is the only time you should accept that you've won the lottery in face of astronomical odds.</p><hr><p>What about epistemic moral luck? If there are epistemic duties, I think luck is important.</p><p>What is wrong with probabilistic justification of knowledge? I have strong suspicions that an enormous portion of what we call &quot;ordinary knowledge&quot; is probabilistic. 
 
r: how do you know X?
I know X because X has a Y probability?
r: how do you know X has a Y probability?
r: how do you know that &quot;you know X because X has a Y probability?&quot;</p><p>I don't understand the newspaper example in the Lottery paradox.</p><p>In the case of the odds, the agent, Sally, forms her belief that &quot;X is a losing ticket&quot; BEFORE there is a resulting winner.</p><p>In the case of the newspaper, the agent forms her belief that &quot;X is a losing ticket&quot; AFTER there is a resulting winner, since they reliably form their belief by reporting on the Lottery administor's claim of who won. </p><p>Back to the odds, maybe the agent could form her belief AFTER the resulting winner, but before the hearing the Lottery admin, qua the odds. This is kind of weird though, since the results are already decided - it is no longer a matter of probability. Probability has to do with predicting the future. Probability is about being a prediction at time T1 about some future event at time T2. </p><p>This example seems tainted with epistemic problems about &quot;the future.&quot; </p><p>Ah, but she reliably formed her belief even after there was a winner. So, it does work. </p><p>Something tricky is happening in this newspaper example.</p><p>Let's say the Lottery admin uses a computer to report the results, and this computer is the accurate in its reporting 99% of the time, and fails 1% of the time. The Lottery admin puts the result in, and the computer reports/broadcasts the result. When the computer says, &quot;Sally won the lottery,&quot; there is a 99% chance that it is true. </p><p>Now, I take this computer to be very similar to a reliable newspaper in salient ways. Newspapers aren't always right.</p><p>Why should we think the newspaper is the sort of evidence which leads to knowledge but not looking at the odds?</p><p>If Sally listens to the computer, she will form knowledge 99% of the time. </p><p>Odds: Sally Lost
Lottery Event
Do the odds matter now? Let's say they do. </p><p>The newspaper is not as reliable as the odds. Why should we trust the newspaper over the odds? Perhaps you shouldn't! I assume the odds of the Newspaper getting it wrong are astronomical, and of course, we can think of a Lottery  with enough tickets to over come these odds. Why should you trust the Lottery? You shouldn't. You need to listen to the newspaper, then you need to contact other people, the lottery admins before you should change your belief about the lottery.</p></div>
