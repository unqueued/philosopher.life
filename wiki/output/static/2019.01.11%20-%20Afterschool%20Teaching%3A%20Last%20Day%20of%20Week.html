<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The office doesn't ask who I am anymore. They let me in on the buzzer. Paperwork. </p><p>My coworkers talk about inanities. Clearly, I am doing something wrong. Eh. This is part for the course on every job site.</p><p>I was called to the office to recite my credentials like a monkey to a group of primates. I am feeling extra primitive today. üòÉ </p><p>Matt and Whitney are discussing the finer points of keeping males and females all the way to age 19 separated. I'm directed to make sure bfs and gfs are never to be together. </p><p>Meanwhile, I also turn a blind eye to mobile phone usage. Why the hell would I stop them? This is babysitting, and I think their phone usage is actually a wiser use of their time than what they'd otherwise be doing in the Friday freetime. I am containing the contagions and quietly reminding the kids that swearing in my earshot would require me to hold them accountable. </p><p>6CM thanked me for allowing her to use her phone as I farcically explained the should not have their phones. If they are kind to each other, I'm doing fine, imho. If I can help them be productive or listen carefully to them, I am being useful. </p><p>The further along I get in this, the more I can see it is not designed for me to actually teach in any significant way. Tutoring and ensuring they do their homework is about all I am in a position to do in most cases. The social inertia and limitations placed on me put me a difficult position. </p><p>Fridays aren't terrible.</p><p>Apparently, there are 4 people who thought it was terrible and funny that 5LL was lying to me about his mother not wanting me to help him with his fractions. </p><p>5NP continues to be the terror and bane of everyone. He might be able to stay in the program. It's not everyday that I have to tell a boy to stop humping the desks (literally). He's constantly fucking with people. I'm having to go hardline on him. This is silly since I can be ridiculously easy going with most. I can't give this kid an inch.</p></div>
