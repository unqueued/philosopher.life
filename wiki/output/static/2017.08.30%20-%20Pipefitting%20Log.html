<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I get to leave a bit later when I don't have Chris driving. I guess I drive faster but still safer than he does, in addition to missing one stop. This is nice. It buys me some breathing room in the morning. I listened to Revisionist History again. I am disappointed in Gladwell, yet again. He is very sure of himself, and he shouldn't be.</p><p>I'm getting the writing part down mechanically. I have a regimen in the morning when I arrive on the worksite. I have to make sure I don't sacrifice my time socializing/networking, but I need time for myself as well.</p><p>We were split into groups again. I hope to permanently stay with Chris-M. So far, so good. Brandon was assigned to another group. I do not know why. I need to think about it. He was assigned to cut some plate. Dave is very concerned with my group's work since it is literally the primary point of the project, the header. Sounds like he has people breathing down his neck.</p><p>Chris has to go with Bear and Chad again. Poor bastard. =(</p><p>I'm going to do more stretching than Dave has us do. It obviously helps me. I don't care if it looks weird.</p><p>I cut straps, cleaned up, and fit the Victaulic gasket after lubrication. I worked with Chris-M to try and get the giant 4 thousand pound pipes in position, but clearly, our hacks aren't going to work. We need an operator, but there are only 2 on the site (and they are busy). Lack of logistical foresight here, and not on our part. </p><p>I'm working with another guy, Lucas, who was also a graduate from Tim's class 5 years ago. He tried both UA unions in TN. He said it doesn't work if you don't know anyone or if they don't immediately like you. He says they didn't do anything to help him learn. He says they couldn't find him any work either, and that he couldn't find work otherwise without paying a 10k fee. He had to wait a year. It seems like I know a lot more than he does. I wonder if he just half-assed it. </p><p>Chester, my boss's boss saw us standing on talking (quite a user of Humanity, let me tell you). He tried to drill sergeant us with the angry &quot;are you busy?&quot; Lol. Umm..you realize that our lack of things to do isn't our fault here. I am passionate about working, but your lack of planning is not my fault. I'm just a helper, yo.</p><p>Chris-M used a formula to calculate the weight of the pipe. I asked for it. Looks incredibly useful. Works for all steel.</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>Lucas and I talked about the unions, about the various companies at Eastman. Yates is high paying, but they only have their foot in the door here at Eastman, and they aren't all the way through the test (this is the test). TEC is the primary maintenance company. He said Chris and I are incredibly lucky to have this job. We might be the highest paid non-journeyman graduates from Tim's class from the sounds of it. Lucas attended 5 years ago, David 4ish years ago. </p><p>There wasn't anything to do at the header, so I went and helped Chris move pipe. It was the firewatch Lesbian grandma (who is unskilled at wielding the Lull as a crane), Chris, and me rigging and moving giant pipe. We moved 1 pipe into position from the &quot;townsquare&quot; (the center area between 290, 309, 233, 234, 291, which is why I'm calling it that) between 291 and 234. We then moved 4 other pipes to the side of 290 in order to reach the last piece we need to bring to 234. Jeff, a new journeyman, is apparently pissing everyone off. He's the one asking for this. I don't mind though since I'm gaining valuable skills and knowledge here.</p><p>Bear came over to show us what was what. He was obviously perturbed that we were rigging without his consent, expertise, and authority. Lol. I'm glad Chris deals with it. I'm just helping on this one. Hilariously, Bear was trying to flip the pipe over (that's what he was trying to show up), but in the process, he slammed it into + scraped it against the concrete block next to it. That is why I didn't want to flip it there. But, of course, this man who has been a rigger for 20-30 years (but still has the wrong attitude to become a foreman, clearly) is going to do it his way.</p><h2 class="">Lunch!</h2><p>I helped do the rigging under Bear's supervision. He decided it necessary to pull Dave over to talk shit about me in a meeting. Wonderful. I did as was required and headed back to Chris-M. Give me 5 years, and I'll be Bear's equal or superior.</p><p>We got the Victaulic fitup done for the first part of the header. I think I need a shackle for each choker. I did some of the rigging for it, and help the piece in place and has got the other half set. We had to flip the giant nuts+bolts after we got them set (took quite a while...these are fucking huge, and the ground ones can't even be finished). Of course, we don't have a 2-3/4&quot; socket yet, it's on req. </p><p>Also, another fitter who joined us, Greg, talked to me. He told me he was Tim's student. He talked about Tim's odd teaching style, but his appreciation for it. I'm not the first person to notice, clearly. Greg is not stupid; he saw the method to the madness.</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>Pushed Bricks.</p><p>Went to help Chris-M. We worked on putting the Victaulic flange on the end of the header. We tried a bunch of things. We didn't have all the rigging tools we needed. I went around to the riggers asking if they had a small chain pull, but the ones we had were all tied up. </p><p>I talked more with Lucas. He has been around the block. He's also looking to exit pipefitting for an office job. It sounds like he has been through the wringer though. I hope to escape that, but we'll see.</p><p>Dave asked me to climb the 40-foot scaffold to cap the pipe. I used duct tape to make a carrier/tote of the cap for my arm. I found out afterward that they should have had a retractable way up high for me start off with, which makes so much sense. I asked David-C, who told me this, to report it to the safety man. I'll ask him if he did later. I don't think I'll do that again. It was quite scary, and it wasn't a risk I should have taken. Dave &quot;thanked&quot; me later. He would not have asked his son to do that (his son has been following him around all day). </p><p>Dave is clearly butting heads with Chester. This makes it difficult. Dave was lamenting with me about it. Perhaps I've earned a modicum of respect from him, I don't know. I shouldn't have done it anyway.</p><p>Afterward, I went to help Chris-M for one last try before we rolled up for the day. It failed. We decided to wait until tomorrow and use the right tools. Take it slow!</p></div>
