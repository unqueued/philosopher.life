<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>One of the most elusive words today is the concept of relevance. What is relevance?</p><p>A dictionary says: the relation of something to the matter at hand.</p><p>This is fairly broad, fairly odd, but you can see that the dictionary‚Äôs definition is at least getting where we want to be going. However, the existence of a relationship between two things is not enough. Relevance is not just any old relationship, relevance must be more. It must be a specific measurement or degree of a specific relation.</p><p>As usual, I like to look at the synonyms of words to get a better feeling for what it is and is not. Context becomes fairly important. And, it could be the case that synonyms shows paths of relevance of a word. (Yes, the word ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù gets me giddy).</p><p>Synonyms include: applicability, cogency, connectedness, connection, connexion, materiality, pertinence, pertinency, point, reference to, regard to, relation to, respect to.</p><p>Further inquiries into these synonyms results in circular definitions all pointing towards relevance and relation (whether concerned with ‚Äòpractical‚Äô application or semantical connection). We‚Äôll just say that the world in general ‚Äúthinks‚Äù they know what is meant by relevance, even if they can‚Äôt define it.</p><p>Don‚Äôt worry, even the elite are confused.</p><p>For example, many philosophers and word scientists have suggested that it is a relation such as: q is relevant to p if q is implied by p. Logical implication still may not draw out the *ahem* relevant characteristic of relevance. There are problems with such a theory. For example, while [‚ÄùCircles are round‚Äù] may be eventually logically implied by [‚ÄùCats are mammals‚Äù] in the long chain of deductions that we call the ‚Äúconjunction of truths‚Äù, the logical implication, however ‚Äúclose‚Äù the relation, simply does not seem actually relevant. Relevance just isn‚Äôt captured by logical implication, it misses the point. The philosophers, who turn to man-made language, predicate logic, etc, to solve their problem, will not find solace in such a definition.</p><p>It was a nice try, but like the dictionary‚Äôs argument, it does not reveal the form of relevance. Perhaps, *cough, their definitions are not as relevant to the discussion of the meaning of ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù as these sources would hope. The missing piece to the logic puzzle is simple and elegant‚Äìmaybe even too obvious.</p><p>Relevance is about importance‚Äìrelevance is about value. Relevance is a value calculation. Let us see why.</p><p>First, I commend the sources of truthiness for pointing out a very relevant characteristic of relevance. The most concrete thing we can understand about relevance is that‚Äì</p><p>Relevance calculate a relations of two variables:</p><p>1.) The matter/object at hand (often misidentified and more complex that initially conceived).
2.) The relevant object (‚Äù&quot;).</p><p>There is only one specific type of relation (of the many that can exist between two objects) that we can call relevance. It is a value-linking relation, one of value-contributor and value-receiver or sum, that enables ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù to have any meaning at all. Relevance is a scaling term. Some things are more relevant than others to a matter/object at hand. To the degree that an object is necessary, fundamental and important to the matter or object at hand is the degree of its relevance. Explicitly:</p><p>Relevance is the value of the relevant object as related to the object at hand (not necessarily perceived by, rather actually contributed to ‚Äòthe object at hand‚Äô)</p><p>When I ask, ‚Äúwhat is relevant?‚Äù, I am actually asking, ‚ÄúWhat things have value?‚Äù Relevance cannot be understood outside a value-system. Relevance is more than a causal relation or logical implication. Relevance is meaningless outside of value. How an object contributes value to another is the calculable relevance of the contributing object to the object at hand. Let us go through a series of relevance questions to better understand it.</p><p>What is the relevance of cats to mammals? -&gt; What value does ‚Äúcats‚Äù contribute to ‚Äúmammals‚Äù? Take the sum value of ‚Äúcats‚Äù and that is what it contributes to the value of mammals. Insofar as mammal increases in value because of cats‚Äô value contribution to it, cats are relevant to mammals.</p><p>[Value of Cats]+[Value of non-cat Mammals]=[Value of Mammals]</p><p>Relevance percentile would look like:</p><p>[value of Cats]/[Value of Mammals]=Percentile relevance of Cats to Mammals.</p><p>These are basic (very basic) relevance-object and object-at-hand, with an easy to understand relation, and one of the easiest types of questions to understand relevance. The relevance-object and object-at-hand can become as complex and specific as any particular characteristic of anything. It can also be mundane and obvious. Regardless, all of them follow this formula. Relevance questions become slightly more difficult to understand when we ask more universal ones because we have to really accept the notion of universal value to make any sense of it at all (and that isn‚Äôt an easy task). Consider the question:</p><p>What is relevant about boats?</p><p>There is a hidden statement in this question, namely, while we have the relevance-object (boats), we lack an explicit object at hand. The object at hand, in general and in this question, is ‚Äúthe universe‚Äù (all existence, this actual world, etc.). The question should actually be read:</p><p>What is the relevance of boats to the universe?</p><p>The answer, of course, is that boats are only relevant insofar as they contribute to the sum total value of the actual world. We presume that the total value of boats is fairly small, but remember kids: it all adds up. Assuming the hidden variable‚Äôs value is the total sum value that could ever be considered, then the answer to [what is relevant about boats?] is the exact same question as [what is the value of boats?].</p><p>Notice that defining a hidden variables makes our job easy. Defining variables can become even more complex. We could, for example ask:</p><p>What is the relevance of [the value of boats] to [the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat is the relevance of boats to the universe?‚Äù]?</p><p>Obviously, ‚Äòthe value of boats‚Äô itself is really the key knowledge. We would say that [the value of boats] has 100% relevance to [the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat is the relevance of boats to the universe?‚Äù].</p><p>No matter how complex or simple the two objects or relations they hold, as long as you define the variables exactly, you can calculate relevance.</p><p>Essentially, the solution of any relevance problem requires the prior identification of the relevant elements from which a solution can be constructed. If you don‚Äôt perfectly identify your relevance-object and object-at-hand variables, then you can‚Äôt even form a true relevance question. Even when we can identify, we must evaluate each variable. Here we run into our lacking capacity to properly evaluate an object and knowing whether or not our perceptions of an object‚Äôs value conform to its actual value. That, however, is not the point of this article (even if it is a relevant issue).</p><p>[Value of Relevance-Object]/[Value of Object-in-hand]=Relevance</p><p>This is the fundamental equation to calculate relevance. Whether you show a relevance-objects value-relation to a particular object-in-hand or even the Universe in general, the equation gives you the mathematical framework to make a meaningful statement about the proportional value contributes of any one thing to another.</p><p>How valuable is P to Q? P/Q=the rate of value. Again, two types of relevance questions can be asked. I‚Äôll give an example.</p><p>How relevant was [George Washington] to [the American Revolution]?</p><p>How relevant was [George Washington] to [the universe]?</p><p>Notice how the ratios change. George Washington‚Äôs relevance goes from fairly high to fairly low depending upon the amount of value of the object-in-hand. GW might have been 20% of the Am. Rev‚Äôs value, and thus he retains 20% relevance to AR. As for the universe, GW might not have much relevance at all. Of course, he probably retains more relevance, proportionately, than some average Joe. Both types of relevance questions have their uses‚Ä¶that is to say, both types of questions remain relevant types of questions among the body of questions that could be asked.
I think the topic of ‚Äòrelevance‚Äô is‚Ä¶highly relevant to us because it demonstrates the mathematical strategy model and mental mode from which we can understand and calculate the comparative advantage of one value pursuit over others. It is the basis of our psychological decisions. When we choose one thing instead of another, we are making relevance and value-based calculations. Knowing how we go about making decisions through a clarified definition of relevance gives us an insight into both our responsibility and, more importantly, how we can be more virtuous. We must, therefore, be exceedingly careful in our use of the term ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù so as not to misattribute value to objects. Basic distinctions of perceived relevance and actual relevance must be brought to the forefront of dialogue if we wish to bring the former closer to the latter. Our minds are too easily clouded with misinformation and ‚Äòwell-intentioned‚Äô, relativistic non-sense to waste time with irrelevant definitions and choice-systems of ‚Äúrelevence‚Äù.</p><p>In the end, it is important that we attempt to answer: ‚ÄúHow am I relevant to the universe?‚Äù</p><p>To answer such a question we must use this definition of relevance. And, we will notice from our relevance calculations that we will also ask: ‚ÄúHow relevant SHOULD I be to the universe?‚Äù (explicitly: ‚ÄúWhat is the relevance of [the person I should be] to [the universe]?)
These are distinctly different value calculations. The actual ME is different that what I ought to be. Thus, the first is asking what about my current value, while the second is asking what value I should make myself (through spiritual-value growth‚Äìbecoming virtuous). This shows the degree of a sinnerhood. We can subtract the AM‚Äôs value from the SHOULD BE‚Äôs value, and realize how much we need God‚Äôs grace.</p><p>Anytime you look at something‚Äôs relevance, remember to do so from the perspective of a value-based paradigm. When you make relevance calculations, you must do so from the perspective of value-based morality exclusively. You will be asking: How this X relevant to God‚Äôs Will?</p></div>
