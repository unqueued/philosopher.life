<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Daughter:</p><p>2x mountains, lackey, mwm, matron, leader, krenko. You turn leader into inc, and I just came in my pants. I drop lackey, pass. She mirrors. I MWM. She drops port, vial, lackey. I matron-&gt;whirler (tough call, but I think SS is too fragile; whirler has lower risk). She drops chief, swings with all, I use tokens to block chief and allow lackeys to connect (risk), and she drops SGC+Sting-&gt;lackey. I drop whirler, then lackey. She drops crater and passes. I leader into 2x chiefs + inc (yeah, dat cash monies) and swing for 5 unblocked. She vials chief, pass. Upkeep ports my waste, and I waste it in response; drop mountain, inc-&gt;SGC (she doesn't sac in response), chief, swing with leader and whirler unblocked. She does nothing. I drop land, chief, MWM, krenko, activate, swing for baj7illions.</p><p>Daughter:</p><p>I mull twice (fuck me): mountain, waste, lackey, 2x leader. She chants &quot;don't have a lackey.&quot; I did. =) She topdecks one. I swing with mine, she blocks, I drop MWM. She drops crater. I pay echo, draw vial. You know, I'm regretting swinging with that lackey (I know better, and I don't see why I took the chance). She matrons-&gt;SS.</p><hr><p>Derailed. Son brought me the skullclamp sitting on a surface next to me. We talked about what made it such a godly card, how it dialectically inverts everything to various <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> in most metagames. It's banworthiness and explanations of the cost for that power with comparisons to Goblins took us down an excellent path. This got us into discussing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> and much more, yet again. </p><hr><p>My son revealed information about the gamestate, and we talked about the nature of cheating and information advantages.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button> I ended up playing with my daughter while my son was upstairs to demonstrate even part of it. I got my daughter from losing to winning unconditionally, I walked upstairs, and then I let make her mistakes and helped my son play from the brink of destruction. I was able to help him come very close to winning several times (though, he needed very little instruction...he talked the entire time about WHY he was doing what he was doing; it was brilliant). In the end, I was able to certain defeat to certain victory. Certainly, nothing is certain.</p><hr><p>Magic is about narrowing down all the possibilities to the ones that matter. It is sifting through the random chaos for the signal. Pick out what is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="salient.html">salient</a>. What is winning in magic? Find the necessary means to your ends, and sift through the remaining necessary combinations which form sufficiency to find that which is the meaniest of the means to your ends: those which have the highest empirical probability of achieving your <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="end.html">end</a>.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">d : </span> Indeed, the information advantages I hand over in this wiki are profound. One could imagine adversaries that could use this information to torture me, to manipulate me, to manipulate those around me. If we do not learn to quickly establish trust in this desert, then we will be forced to engage in the same memetic evolutionary processes that those ancient nomads underwent, a survival of the fittest which radically altered verbal IQs high enough to build <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="T2T.html">T2T</a> and then eventually <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. Unfortunately, the digital dialectic is too fast to enable that evolutionary chain to play out. Our margin of error is much, much smaller. </sub></p></div>
