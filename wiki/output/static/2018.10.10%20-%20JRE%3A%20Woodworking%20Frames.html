 Not an emergancy</code></pre><p>Somethin' ain't right with our carriers again. =/</p><p>My brother made picture frames today. Took him all day, so he must be kinda slow!<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button> Lol. He was telling me about making a mistake and rolling with the punches to make art from it. I think that is fabulous. I love hearing about woodgrain considerations, which obviously require real thought to handle. He's using spline joints. I had to look these up. My god, <em>that</em> is woodworking right there. I hope he showed 'em off on the outside. He's gonna send pictures. I'm excited.</p><p>We talked about timelines again. He said he'd keep a tally of every time I talk about it. I think that is a fantastic idea, especially with timestamps. We laughed. I suggested he just take pictures with the timestamps and directories. I hope he records the story of his life here. Future you will thank you.</p><p>We talked about McManus. He was interested. My brother is better at philosophy and political reasoning than he ever wants to admit, imho. He hit the nail on the head in identifying Peterson's prescription/description (his words) sleight of hand. He doesn't always want to systematically say what's on his mind, and I understand I'm &quot;over the top&quot; on this matter. Still, I'm grateful to think about his point of view whenever he offers it.</p><p>Talked about vitamins. My brother is very much against the cultic insanity of anti-scientific approaches to health. I appreciate that about him, and I hope to continue to see through his justified skeptical lens. I think I make him uncomfortable in this respect. He does a good job of hearing my opinion while pointing to the larger problem at hand. </p><p>I'm looking forward to pics. I'm hoping he will walk me through what he has made so I can see the story that he does.</p><p>Oh, he's gonna start building a giant tool/foundation thing. I should have questioned further on the matter. Links or names in writing help. When I'm walking around half a mile away from the house on my phone, I can't google as we talk. I hope he will show me his designs and reasoning for it in advance. I want to see the thing come alive.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button> </p><p>I wonder if he's going to find a place with lots of wood to cut for himself. </p><pre><code>

 I had to shit in a &quot;hat&quot; for my gi doctor (bucket that clips onto the seat) today.  Gotta collect 3 samples.  Definitely still have a gag reflex... I chose the wrong shit to try to collect.  It was so huge, looked like my body had been hiding every bite of curry I ever consumed to expel in one colossal shit. Had to poke it with a q tip and rub on a little cardboard sample matchbook looking thing
