<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>To Whom It May Concern,</p><p>I am writing today as an applicant for the position of Instructional Technologist. As you will find in my resume, I am committed to learning and to helping others learn; it is my vocation. While I‚Äôve enjoyed teaching for years, I also strongly value facilitating the learning process and building educational infrastructure. I recognize that this foundation is vital for creating a strong educational program in an increasingly technological society, and I believe I have the background and skills necessary to support Milligan‚Äôs mission in this position.</p><p>Technology has always been a passion of mine, and I love sharing it with others. I realize not everyone enjoys technology as much as I do or has had the opportunity to learn it as thoroughly, so I hope to empower them. I want to contribute to higher education by finding, implementing, and training others to use the right tools for the job. I hope to morally wield my passion for technology and enable others to thrive.</p><p>I have backgrounds in instruction and technology. I empathize with the needs of teachers because I‚Äôve been one for a long time. As a teacher, I tuned my learning management tools to fit my needs. I‚Äôve had to design courses I‚Äôve taught from scratch, customizing not only content but also the delivery and testing methods. Finding and implementing emerging technologies is something I‚Äôm constantly engaged in while homeschooling my children as well.</p><p>In most jobs I've had, I‚Äôve usually been one of the first contacted for technology problems by the people around me. I enjoy helping others make the most of their tools. I'm also not afraid to get my hands dirty, to improvise, and to research better methods for the technological issues embedded in the world around me.</p><p>I have strong opinions about privacy, open source IT, and moral rights to information access. Be it directly or indirectly, my goal is to get the best information into the hands of the people that need it as quickly as I can for the lowest financial and social costs possible.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I hope to hear from you soon.</p><p>Sincerely,</p></div>
