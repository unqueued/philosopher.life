I think it would be good for everyone to take a variety of courses, but that they should be aimed towards &quot;outsiders&quot; more.</p><p>Infinite Jest takes a lot of work to read, and if I hadn't heard how good it was I wouldn't have bothered. That's a big problem when you want to write something &quot;difficult&quot; (like your own mind-upload), people need to be convinced it's worth it to do the work. It's why I try to write in a user-friendly way. (Cool to hear that I remind you of your professor btw!)</p><p>I get that you're somewhat autistic (but it wasn't obvious or so) and nothing you've said or done has been rude. It does seem like you want to have a more involved, complex conversation than I have time and energy for in email form, so don't take it personally if I don't pick up every thread you lay down.</p><p>I'll say something about your last questions though: I don't thing &quot;objective meaning&quot; makes sense at all. Meaning is a judgment that feels like a perception. We can, however, identify what sort of things tend to feel meaningful and my best gesturing in that direction is probably the article about the Eurovision Song Contest as a &quot;Meaning-Making System&quot; and the article by Kevin Simler it refers to. About metanarrative I don't know.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>/John
