<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was a Friday, so it was short. It was, however, productive. I was loaned my elective course book, and I did some minor highlighting. There are many topics which I hadn't even known about in this book. I'll be glad to go through it. But, today I didn't study. Instead, I asked to work on my resume. That's what I did. I didn't finish it until I got home though. I think it looks quite clean. I'm not convinced by the coloration, but I really like the structure and appearance otherwise. The content is the best I can do considering a complete lack of experience in the industry. So, for now, it's all set. </p><p>I also ordered two different drug tests, since they can't always be trusted. I spent time sifting through reviews. I got a slightly more expensive one to make sure that DCK isn't setting false positives for PCP (otherwise, I'll have to stop taking it when we get around to interview time). I am not very concerned about DCK tests since it is only an analog and it doesn't get tested. </p><p>I also picked up a pack of THC tests. The expensive one, which I have assumed will be the most accurate from what I've gathered, will be what I use to test the viability of these cheap THC tests. If I show up negative on both, great. Otherwise, I hope to show up positive on both. The next worst case is that the expensive one shows it and the inexpensive targeted THC tests do not, in which case the inexpensive ones are useless (or perhaps require multiples). In any case, I won't be applying until I can pass the drug test. What's the point? Reputation and first impressions, even on paper, matter. I can't afford to screw this up.</p><p>We'll see how my tests go. Afterward, I will begin applying. I've gathered a list of pipefitter employers in my area. I'm shooting for $15 an hour, but I'd take minimum wage. I really do see myself as getting paid in experience here. The goal is to form a semblance of understanding of actual working conditions. I'd like to have a base comparison point to the union as well. Working conditions and power structures deserve analysis, and it will allow me to hit the ground running at the union. I have many possible ladders to climb, and I need to find the safest and most profitable route.</p><p>I need to start developing interview questions (from both sides, mine and theirs), and I need to practice in a few mock interviews. I need to be confident and absurdly believable. Interviews are sales, and sales are a form of deception (pure and simple). This is not my natural stance, so I will need to practice these encounters.</p><p>I would prefer to co-op. Even if they won't, I may ask my teacher if I could just have 5-days a week count as my co-op. This hasn't been done, to my knowledge. But, he may make an exception. Ideally, I will be certified, have finished the course, and not burn any bridges. On top, I'll have real-world experience and make money, which we desperately need. I'm not quite sure how I will handle AB&amp;T. It depends on how things pan out here.</p><p>Also, I saved the bolts/nuts from our torque class (because they were throwing them away). They are fairly small, but I think I could make dogs out of them. I'll do my best. =)</p></div>
