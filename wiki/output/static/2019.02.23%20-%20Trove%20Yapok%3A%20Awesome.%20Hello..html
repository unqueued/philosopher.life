Thank you for {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="contact.html">contact</a>}ing me, and please let me know if I can {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="help.html">help</a>} you! I have some guesses about your name, but I would love to hear your explanation.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hey, I'm just a 23-year-old college dropout who randomly stumbled across your wiki thing.
</p></blockquote><p>I feel lost all the time wandering in the desert. I'm a 33-year-old post-secondary education dropout as well. I prize my education, but I am extremely unhappy with academia. I don't know your circumstances. I hope it is not too painful to you. I'm here to listen to you, in any case.</p><p>Given the timing, I assume you stumbled upon this wiki via /r/TheMotte. If not, let me know! I have no idea how people reach me. It is a wonderful surprise to have people just reach out to me in the desert to say &quot;hello.&quot;</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Um, I wanted to know why you put so much effort into things.
</p></blockquote><p>The clearest answer I have is in {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>} and {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>}. My motivations are not easily explained, imho. I'm going to fail to do myself justice here by trying to summarize it too quickly, but I will try to do so for you.</p><p>I believe I have freewill, and my choices matter. My life is meaningful (even if I make huge mistakes). I can only do my best, and that's what I expect of myself (and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a>).</p><p>Why not put so much effort into things?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This is a really weird email to write, but I'm gonna go through with it anyways.
</p></blockquote><p>Oh, don't worry. I'm a heretical madman in the desert. I'm an outcast. Please don't feel unnecessarily uncomfortable writing with me. I think it's a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="good.html">good</a> thing that we can openly talk to each other about what matters most. We don't need to do some social-conventionally imposed song and dance, engage in useless <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="smalltalk.html">smalltalk</a>, or worry about weirdness here. My openness, disagreeableness, and neuroticism are off the charts; go ahead and assume I'm weird AF, please. You aren't being weird to me, and I beg you feel at home speaking with me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Maybe your answer could help me put effort into things too.
</p></blockquote><p>I am happy to help you as best I can. It may take quite a bit of dialectical work between us to get to the bottom of it. I have to warn you: I often have unpleasant answers and points of view. </p><p>What matters to you, what's your purpose, what's our purpose, and why? </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Anyways, I really admire everything that you've done on the wiki, but I'm afraid that I can't understand it.
</p></blockquote><p>That is high praise. Let me suggest you have only seen a tiny portion of it. It's much, much bigger than you might realize. I am sure there are parts of my wiki you won't admire as well.</p><p>I apologize for not making myself easy to understand. If you can believe it: I'm trying! You've inspired me to consider making a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="TLDR.html">TLDR</a> section of this wiki. I really don't like the fact that people hate my work, find it hard to understand, etc. That's not my goal. Some things are difficult to reduce. This will sound absurdly arrogant, but I think my point of view can be difficult to communicate to someone who doesn't have a background like mine in philosophy and religion. I will listen closely to your criticisms and preferences here. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It seems really neat and I wish I could understand it, but what if even after I try, I still can't?
</p></blockquote><p>Some writings have taken me decades to iterate upon to have the understanding I do. There are some risks I've taken in understanding a topic which failed too! Exploration is necessary. I think you've gotta be resilient, open, and do your best.</p><p>It's okay you won't instantly understand me, right? Engage in honest and passionate dialectics with me, and the process of empathizing with each other can be accelerated. It will take me quite a while to understand your point of view as well.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>That kinda thought makes me umm.. sad I guess. 
</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate your use of the word &quot;guess.&quot; What do you think of guessing? What role does it serve? Is there anything you are certain of? What is worth guessing about?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I should send this before I get too rambly.
</p></blockquote><p>Ah. It is highly unlikely you are going to be too rambly for me. I find your writing style different. It's squishy while also being caveatic. It's an interesting combination. You are also all too brief for my preferences. </p><p>I think the wiki is also a perfect way to start framing, scaffolding, relating, deconstructing and constructing. Think about grabbing one at <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://tiddlywiki.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://tiddlywiki.com/</a>. Speaking to each other over our wikis may be a useful way for us to understand each other. There are parts of my wiki which may be difficult to appreciate or understand without having practiced using a wiki yourself. I enjoy having <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hyperconversation.html">hyperconversation</a>s with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Public%2520Self-Modelers.html">Public Self-Modelers</a>.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Really sorry for weirding you out and probably wasting your time.
</p></blockquote><p>Please don't feel sorry. You have not weirded me out or wasted my time. I am listening to you.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Thanks, I guess, in advance,</p><p>- Zach
</p></blockquote><p>No problem! It's my pleasure.</p><p>This may be the last time I ping you with a message over e-mail. I will leave my correspondence with you on the wiki for you to find. You might consider bookmarking parts of the wiki for updates.</p><p>Please let me know if and where you want me to look for understanding who you are as well.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a></p></div>
