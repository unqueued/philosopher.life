<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>What is substance? What role does substance serve in Aristotle’s philosophy? What is the difference between primary and secondary substance? How does substance relate to the other categories? What is homonymy? How does Aristotle solve Meno’s paradox? How does Aristotle explain concept formation? What is teleology? What are the four causes? How they relate to one another and substance? What is the status of luck and chance? What is Aristotle’s account of the soul? How does he differ from his predecessors (especially Plato)? What are the different types of soul according to Aristotle? What is the causal structure behind his account of sense-perception? Is Aristotle a mental realist? Is he a functionalist? What is the relation between the intellectual faculty and sense-perception? What is the scope of Aristotle’s Metaphysics? How does it relate to the other sciences? What were the views of his predecessors? What is the significance of the aporiai? What is the significance of the Law of Non-Contradiction and the Law of the Excluded Middle? How does the metaphysical schema of potentiality and actuality operate and what problems does such a schema resolve? What is the status of universals? Are there such things as separable substances? Finally what does Aristotle’s god do, if anything?</p><p>Term paper due the day of the final.</p><p>Paper topics are coming out in two weeks.</p><p>Notes: August 23</p><p>Organon-Necessary things to do philosophy at all. What is the nature of substance itself?</p><p>Hellenic – Aristotle. Highest phil is metaphysics. Immaterial and material realms.</p><p>Hellenistic – Epicureans, Stoics, Sceptics. Highest phil. Topic is ethics. Material realm only.</p><p>Categories earliest work. Metaphysics is his mature works. Some of it in stark contrast and as a response to Plato’s doctrines.</p><p>Read for account of substance, quality, and quantity.</p><p>Category=Predication</p><p>Attributing properties to something.  In “The book is red.”, “red” is predicating book. The predication of book is “red”.</p><p>Predicating on substance.</p><p>You can’t do philosophy or science without “substance”.  The most crucial of categories, as the other categories are dependent upon this one.</p><p>Plato’s particulars are the same as Aristotle’s sensible substances.</p><p>Homework: August 23-25</p><p>Categories – pg. 3-17 </p><p>Notes – August 25</p><p>Divides up being (father of science). His metaphysics is Being qua (in virtue of, as) Being.</p><p>Aristotle (and Plato) consider the Sophists bad because they confuse the accidental with the essential. The Sophists have no framework to understand the Essential and how the accidental relates to what is Essential. Aristotle, obviously, is an essentialist.</p><p>Aristotle thinks the cosmos is eternal and unchanging. He couldn’t make sense of ‘ex nihilo’, for example. No creator, etc. for Aristotle’s worldview.</p><p>Category comes from categorema, meaning predications.</p><p>Aristotle is creating the formal structure of subject and predicate. Language and knowledge reflect the structure of being.</p><p>Epistemic states (to Aristotle) are the states of the soul. Our epistemic states refelect the ontological nature of the world. This is why Aristotle thinks the world is knowable.</p><p>Parmenides assumes that “Thinking and Being are the same thing”. Aristotle (and Plato) are responding, in part, to this pre-socratic thought.</p><p>Heracleitus says that “you can never step ito the same river twice”. Phenomena unifies opposites. Again, another influential figure/thought for Aristotle to contend with.</p><p>You can’t predicate a primary substance of a primary substance. You can predicate secondary substances of primary substances.</p><p>Substance is at the heart of Aristotle’s philosophy (even though the categories are an early work). Later, he will change the ontological status of secondary substance. He is using this initial view on secondary substances to deny major Platonic thoughts on Forms.</p><p>Homonymity has the same name, but are functionally different and different definitions of being. A picture of an eye, and an actual eye are homonymous. Picture is only an “eye” in name alone. It is representational of the actual the thing.</p><p>Definition is the essence. “Being of each”.</p><p>Synonymous, a genus has a special relationship with all species under it. Hallmark of an accident is that it isn’t universally applicable. “Animality” however, has some universal applicability to all animals (“Animal” being the Genus, “human” or “ape” or “parrot” being Species).</p><p>Substance and secondary substance does not admit of degree. The other categories do admit degrees.</p><p>Every substance has a specific essence. Substances are trying to realize that essence.</p><p>Aristotle is breaking down Language and Being.</p><p>How it is “things” can be said of “things. “of things” is part of the ontological structure.</p><p>Ontos = “to be” or “being” and Logos = “account”, “structure”, “image”, “word” (many more meanings)</p><p>Episteme = “scientific knowledge”</p><p>Language and Thought are intimately connected to Aristotle. 2-sides of the same coin to them.  So if knowledge isn’t possible, neither is meaningful language.</p><p>Deformity’s, for example, are accidental, and not part of the Essential.</p><p>What are the metaphysics behind how “something” can inhere in “something”.</p><p>Do not confuse the essential with the accidental.</p><p>Some properties are more important than others. Essential properties can’t be changed, but are obviously more important than the accidental properties, which can be altered.</p><p>Notes – August 31</p><p>Substance takes ontological priority (primary ontological standing) over the other categories. Language reflects the structure of being and reality (Ontology). The other categories predicate of Substance. While Aristotle/Plato disagree with Parmenides when he says “Thinking and Being are the same”, they will suggest that the “Structure of thinking mirrors the structure of reality”.</p><p>There is no distinction between a priori and a posteriori in Aristotelian thought. That is a modern distinction (think of Kant).</p><p>The other categories cannot exist outside of Substance. You can’t encounter “4-footedness” in the world, instead, you encounter 4-footed things (substances) in the world. All the other categories depend upon Substance to exist (except as abstractions of thought?).</p><p>The Platonic forms are like Aristotle’s secondary substances. Aristotle is empirical, in some ways, in that he only consider sensible substances (occupy place and time).</p><p>Truth values are only produced of combinations. Simples aren’t true or false. Combination of substance and predicate form truth values.</p><p>The genus governs a finite and eternal set of species. Secondary substance is 2 hierarchies, Genus and species.</p><p>If there aren’t any individual horses (primary substance of this type), then “Horse” as a secondary substance has no meaning.</p><p>Things are eternal and unchanging, otherwise it would undermine the notion of a thing’s essence.</p><p>An accident (like whiteness) can inhere in you “accidental to you” does mean you share the same essence or definition of whiteness. The set of attributes of Humanity relates to you as a human differently than the set of attributes such as whiteness. Accidental properties cannot express a substance’s essence.</p><p>Aristotle explores the notion of things inhering in substances. Things inhere in substances in 2 distinct ways. The first being the essential properties, and the second form of inherence in a substance, are the accidental properties. The status that these properties have are distinct (conceptually). You can lose whiteness and still exist, but you can’t lose humanness and still exist.</p><p>Color is essential to body because you’ll never find a body that doesn’t have color. Which particular color is accidental though.</p><p>Primary substance to Species as Species is to Genus. Much like Plato’s idea of “Good” being more than just being (as the other forms “are”).</p><p>Notes – September 1, 2010</p><p>Definition = Essence - Things only have 1 essence. Subjects are that which underlies and persists (through change of accidental properties, yet keep your self identity).</p><p>Essences are not necessarily realized in a particular substance, but the fact that they ‘should be’ realized is what forms the essence of that particular substance. The essence is very conceptual. A man lacking an essential property (rationality) due to accidental reasons is still a man; his essential property of rationality is just not being fully realized in him. (or so my professor says). Essential causes for a lack of an essential property would be a problem, but not accidental causes. Essential properties are things you “should” have, but not necessarily do have.</p><p>The definition of whiteness is not predicated of any other substances.</p><p>Species and genera are essential attributes.</p><p>Primary substances have a ‘certain this’, and is numerically 1. Secondary substances also have a ‘certain this’, but they also lend themselves to a certain division that the primary substances do not (being possibly numerically many). The unity of secondary substance is weaker than primary substance, as the secondary substance is spread across many primary substances.</p><p>White permeates throughout the entirety of you just as rationality does. They are not “parts” here.</p><p>Part is a limited scope and does not permeate throughout the whole. A hand is a part of your body, and  handness does not permeate your entire body.</p><p>Substances do not have opposites. No Star Trek rules or evil/opposite version of you in another dimension.</p><p>There aren’t possible worlds in Aristotle’s conception of reality.</p><p>Primary substances are equally primary substances. Horses are not more or less of a species than dogs, etc.</p><p>Substance has no opposites, but is capable of receiving accidental attributes with opposites (obviously, not both at the same time).</p><p>Statements and beliefs are not substances themselves. He distinguishes ontology from linguistics, etc.</p><p>Changes in attributes (even opposite attributes) does not change a substance’s oneness and retaining its essence and identity.</p><p>Discreteness has separate entities, continuous does not.</p><p>Quantitative dimensions are found in all substances in the natural world.</p><p>Place represents the limits of the body occupying it. Time like place are considered continuous.</p><p>Only the present exists (in time).</p><p>Notes – September 8, 2010</p><p>Time is a measurement of the motion that substances undergo. Time doesn’t inhere in the subject in the same way that size might. It is special. The past and future don’t ‘exist’ (strongly) to Aristotle. Even the ‘now’ is just a conceptual demarcation of past and future, but doesn’t ‘exist’ in the strongest sense of that status.</p><p>Parmenides’ Poem, Fragment 8: He sets out the nature of being, it is invisible and not temporal. Aristotle, in part, is responding to them. Parmenides and Xeno’s paradox, etc.</p><p>Phenomenal substances are quantity. Non-physical substances don’t necessary have quantity though. Matter and Body have quantitative aspects.</p><p>Quantity has no contrary (and this is one of the reasons it is listed so early). Like substance, Quantity has no contrary (which is extra-important for Aristotle).</p><p>Conceptual consequences of these various modifications of the substances.</p><p>Inches are not “relative” in the same what that “largeness” is relative to substance. Despite what the professor says, I think that “relative” Categories are those which show the relationship between 2 or more substances.</p><p>Equality and inequality are intrinsic to Quantity because they are forms of measurement.</p><p>Time is a form of measurement. It is an essential feature of the natural world. Motion is everlasting, and as a consequence, nor does time. Plato thinks time is an image of eternity.</p><p>Knowledge and Virtue are states. They are dispositions of the soul which (as it were) are more stable than mere conditions. States seem psychological, and conditions seem changing. They may have different domains in which they manifest themselves. States are more permanent and stable.</p><p>Virtues are states rather than conditions. They are extremely difficult to change. The soul develops disposition through habit (or the proper upbringing).  </p><p>Aristotle allows for Akrasia, unlike Socrates (Knowledge=Virtue), and thus upbringing and environment matter?</p><p>Homework – Aristotle Posterior Analytics, 114-118 (Chapters 1-3, 8, 33), Book 2 (Chapters 1-3, 8, 9, 19). Meno (Plato’s account of how we acquire knowledge) – For next Monday.</p><p>Notes – September 15, 2010</p><p>Posterior Analytics – Book 1 – Chapters 1-3</p><p>Episteme = Scientific knowledge</p><p>Scientific thought is about that which is eternal and unchanging.</p><p>Prior Analytics is about syllogistic logistic, the 4 types of syllogism. Syllogism pertains to sets; modern logic can predicate and quantity over individuals (which makes it a more powerful tool).</p><p>Middle term.</p><p>All men are mortal.</p><p>Socrates is a man.</p><p>Socrates is mortal.</p><p>The middle term is “man”.</p><p>The sciences will be expressed syllogistically.</p><p>The posterior analytics turns to the nature of knowledge in the formal sense.</p><p>Three uses of “to be”:</p><p>Existential use; “it is” </p><p>Predicative use; “it is F”; attributing F-ness </p><p>Veridical; “it is true”  </p><p>Aristotle is discussing knowledge in and of itself in the organon.</p><p>He is responding to Meno’s paradox in books 1-3. The paradox is that you are either born ignorant and remain ignorant, or born with knowledge and have no need to acquire it. Knowledge acquisition seems pointless or impossible in this paradox. Plato solves through “recollection” theory.</p><p>Two types of argument:</p><p>Deductive reasoning (putting forth immediate principles) to work downwards for conclusions.</p><p>Inductive reasoning works upwards, you grasp particulars and you work towards a universal.</p><p>You can’t demonstrate the existence of the physical world, it is simply a given. You can deduce things about it. You don’t have arguments about things which are immediately obvious, such as “the world exists”.</p><p>The conclusion of a deductive argument is less knowable than the principles from which that deduction is derived. Premises are more knowable and intelligible than the conclusion.</p><p>Inductive arguments also start with things we know, for instance, particulars. We recognize and grasp the 4-legged creature and its features, and from that we induce principles from it.</p><p>Simpliciter = absolutely</p><p>It is not the case that we are completely ignorant, simpliciter. We do move from having some knowledge to inducing or deducing other knowledge.</p><p>Aristotle makes the distinction between Potentiality and Actuality. These two concepts are crucial to understanding the ontological structure of things.</p><p>Actuality precedes potentiality, conceptually speaking, in his view. The “recollection” theory might be rejected, but it is still conceptually in accordance with Aristotle’s distinction.</p><p>God is not in a state of potentiality, for Aristotle, only Actuality. God is the eternal contemplating thing in a state of complete actuality.</p><p>You have to accept certain basic things, unqualified.</p><p>Once you understand the universal knowledge, you are able to understand incidental knowledge which might fall under it. Sometimes you grasp two things simultaneously due to close proximity.</p><p>You can see particular triangles and know some universal ideas of triangles such that when you see a new/never-before-seen triangle, you’ll know it is a triangle.</p><p>You can gain additional knowledge about a particular thing without contradicting what you already knew about it.</p><p>Sophistic knowledge is a grasp of something in an accidental fashion. These accidental things, however, can’t serve as the definition. These accidental things can’t form the universals because they aren’t essential properties. These can’t serve as scientific knowledge. Aristotle (and Plato) believes the Sophists conflate accidental and essential knowledge/properties; this is why they are against the Sophists.</p><p>In the case of knowledge, you are able to give a proper scientific explanation as to why that thing is the way it is.</p><p>We don’t have a science of a particular thing because particular things can be otherwise. Knowledge is of that which can’t be otherwise. Math is eternal, and thus it can be known. Episteme pertains exclusively to scientific deduction.</p><p>Nous – intellectual grasp of the immediate principles and axioms. It is the principle of knowledge. Knowledge at the highest level.</p><p>Episteme is mediated and deduced from the immediate principles to come to a conclusion.</p><p>Immediate principles are not demonstrated. You just intuitively grasp these things.</p><p>Demonstrations are a type of deduction. Proper demonstrations are never false. They consistently follow from the premises and the principles that govern those premises. Demonstration leads to scientific knowledge.</p><p>You must have non-demonstrated axioms and principles to justify demonstration.</p><p>You can’t demonstrate that human beings exist, but you can demonstrate that they have certain properties.</p><p>Episteme employs the un-demonstrated, but it is nous that allows us to know these axioms. Episteme’s realm is about that which is deduced from these axioms, but it isn’t about the axioms.</p><p>We begin with what is more familiar to us and less knowable in itself, and move to that which is less familiar to us and more knowable in itself. We begin with particulars and move to universal principles. Particulars have accidentals that aren’t very knowable, but universals are essential and very knowable.</p><p>(Supposedly, the Allegory of the Cave fits here; the shadows at the bottom of the cave are the particulars which aren’t entirely knowable, but as you get out of the cave, you come to unfamiliar but far more knowable “forms”.)</p><p>You can’t see the “law of non-contradiction” walking down the street or “the definition of human being” walking down the street, you only see a particular person walking down the street. So, while universals are hard to perceive, they are the most real and the most “knowable”.</p><p>Primitive, simple, and immediate are indemonstrable.</p><p>What is demonstrable requires mediation. Demonstrations are not about what is accidental, only universal.</p><p>There is no science of the accidental.</p><p>Dialectical argument explores and considers argumentative methodology.</p><p>Demonstration is actually looking for truth about the world itself.</p><p>Contraries and different form Contradictories.</p><p>Contradictories do not have a middle, are completely binary, either ‘alive or dead’, there is nothing in the middle. One side or the other MUST be contradictory.</p><p>Contraries do have middles and degradations, “white or black, and everything in between are degrees of grey”. This is a spectrum/continuum, it isn’t modular.</p><p>A definition explains what a unit is.</p><p>Notes – September 20, 2010</p><p>Conceptually, you can’t move from what is unknowable to what is knowable.</p><p>Primitives aren’t ‘unknowable’, they simply aren’t known through episteme, via deductive demonstrations, but rather, they are apprehended immediately, via nous.</p><p>Nous is our highest intellectual faculty.</p><p>Nous shares something in common with the content it is looking upon. It is the immediate intellectual apprehension.</p><p>There is an isomorphism of the epistemic states and the proper objects of those epistemic states. Thinking mirrors the nature of being or the objects upon which the faculties in question focus upon.</p><p>Episteme is deductive and mediated, where nous is an unmediated (immediate) intellectual faculty.</p><p>Primitives and immediates do not requires demonstration – they are the foundation. There is nothing behind them, they are ground zero, conceptually.</p><p>“man exists” is an immediate primitive which does not require demonstration.</p><p>Infinite regresses are unintelligible to Aristotle because it lacks a foundation. Science requires a given, non-demonstrated, immediate, primitive foundation. You either apprehend it conceptually or you don’t, but there is no way to prove it to you.</p><p>More or less intelligibility example: “definition of man” is more knowable than a ‘particular man’ because definition is just form, and a particular man is form and matter (and more complex and difficult to understand).</p><p>Principles and the deductions from them represent the ontological structure of things.</p><p>From nous, the episteme is deduced, and it represents the epistemic structure.</p><p>Note how both the ontological structure mirrors the epistemic structure.</p><p>Circular reasoning is incompatible with scientific thought. It can be reduced to tautology (a=a).</p><p>Posterior Analytics – Book 1 – Chapter 8</p><p>There is a science about perishable things, per se, particularly in there accidental things. A science pertains to what is eternally true about things (even perishable things). There is no science of the accidental.</p><p>Aristotle is concerned with the essential, not the accidental sorts of knowledge in the discussion of epistemology.</p><p>We are a composite of form and matter. Matter is the principle of individuation. Without matter there would be no human beings, only the definition.</p><p>The natural substances are species are eternal, but there are finite amount of particulars of these.</p><p>Centaurs and ghosts are abstracti</p><p>ons from human beings and non-human properties (or some combination of sensible particulars). Artificial definitions exist for these, but there is clearly no science for this.  </p><p>The existence of accidentals ARE crucial.</p><p>While eclipses are occurring, there is a science of eclipses. When there aren’t, there is no science of it.</p><p>Notes – September 22, 2010</p><p>Posterior Analytics, Book 1, Chapter 33</p><p>This is a response to Plato’s two world theory, 474BFF Rep5</p><p>Necessity is an intrinsic aspect of the content that knowledge focuses upon. Opinion, however, lends itself to that which can be otherwise.</p><p>Opinion is about that which can be either true or false, whereas understanding is about that which is true. There is no false understanding. Opinion is linked to appearance.</p><p>The epistemic state mirrors the nature of the relevant ontological state.</p><p>Just as the epistemic state of opinion is unstable, so too are the objects upon which is focuses.</p><p>Opinions are unstable because you can change your mind. Knowledge, however, does not have the changeable property.</p><p>You are aware when you put forth an opinion, and you are aware of when you are putting forth scientific knowledge. Both opinion and knowledge are pregnant with consciousness.</p><p>You can know X and you can have an opinion X. The difference is not an ontic one, only an epistemic one. The manner in apprehension with respect to object X is different for ‘knowing’ and ‘opinion’.</p><p>Nous analogously stands to episteme in the same way that premises stand to conclusions.</p><p>You cannot opine X and not opine X. Aristotle may be countering Pythagoras’ ‘measurement doctrine’.</p><p>Ontology is primal to epistemology.</p><p>Book 2 – Chapter 1</p><p>Four equal things must be understood: the fact, the reason why, if it is, what it is.</p><p>Descartes severs ontology and epistemology. This is why he was revolutionary. Aristotle saw that ontology informs epistemology. Descartes thinks epistemology informs ontology.</p><p>It makes no sense to deny the ontological aspect of things for an ancient because the self is a product of the ontological foundation of things.</p><p>Notes – September 27</p><p>Aristotle thinks that the possession of ‘nous’ is on a continuum for children.</p><p>Children think in terms of particulars, and not necessarily in terms of universal principles.</p><p>Poetic/Spiritual ‘knowledge’ falls into neither ‘nous’ nor ‘episteme’.</p><p>Tragedies are particular stories will particular individuals from which some principles of ethics can be extracted. They aren’t scientific accounts of ethics though. They are merely accidental extractions.</p><p>Posterior analytics, Book 2, Chapter 3</p><p>Not all definitions have demonstrations.</p><p>Definitions are universal and affirmative. The essence or essentials of what a thing is.</p><p>Demonstrations are not always universal and affirmative, thus it is different from definition.</p><p>Both are required though. You can do science without demonstration, and if you can’t grasp the definition of a thing, then you are obviously can’t do science.</p><p>Experiencing a substance has stronger awareness-factor than just being told the definition of a substance. Perceptual cognition is a crucial step in epistemological development for Aristotle.</p><p>Experience particulars to develop and understand the universals of those particulars.</p><p>The principles of demonstrations are definitions. Definition itself is not a substance, it is a definition of a substance (until the metaphysics). Definition is the intelligible structure of substance.</p><p>Demonstration assumes definitions, and in virtue of definitions goes on to demonstrate things.</p><p>Necessary for science: Categories (ontological framework) and Posterior Analytics (epistemic framework).</p><p>Scientific thought explains ‘that it is’ and ‘what it is’.</p><p>There are demonstrations without definition, and there are definitions without demonstrations. They are separate. Both are required for doing scientific thought. Nous and episteme are required for engaging in scientific thought.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Not all deductions are demonstrations.</p><p>Demonstrations and deductions occupy different segments of the scientific landscape.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>In Plato, two accounts of recollection theory:</p><p>Epistemological account – Meno’s account. If you have Socrates ask someone the right sorts of questions, that person will be able to recall what is in the soul, and as a result be able to discard their false beliefs and convert their true beliefs into knowledge. The soul has a prenatal existence in which it had all scientific knowledge, but through birth forgets it.</p><p>Ontological account – Phaedo account. The soul prior to being born is in direct contact with the platonic forms. When it sees instances of (imperfect) things like “justice” or “equality” in the world, it compares those instances with their corresponding forms (which are the perfect instantiations of those things). Unlike the epistemic account, this one obviously needs the Platonic forms.</p><p>Aristotle thinks these are unnecessary to layout the epistemic foundation of Knowledge. He is responding to the platonic account of concept formation. The account does not require some prenatal existence.</p><p>Reading – Physics Book 2</p><p>Notes –September 29</p><p>Aitia = Cause (explanation) – This is wider notion than our contemporary view.</p><p>Readings for the Midterm – Categories, Posterior Analytics, Physics (Books 2 and 4)</p><p>According to Aristotle, It is absurd to claim that we do have knowledge of the immediates but not be aware of them. If you know a thing, you are aware of it. There is no subconscious.  Intellectual apprehension entails consciousness of a thing.</p><p>What is the epistemic landscape of the middle path between not knowing simpliciter and knowing simpliciter?</p><p>Aristotle denies our prenatal existence, but rather posits a capacity (dunamis, or potential) to come to know.</p><p>The capacity is not more valuable than the realization of that capacity. The capacity is not as precise as the actualization of that capacity.</p><p>Actual knowledge is better than potential knowledge of the principles.</p><p>Both animals and humans are capable of perceiving, but only humans are capable of making sense of those perceptions in terms of genera and species, references and classes.</p><p>Some animals have memories of perceptions, but only the sorts that can classify those perceptions into genera and species are actually intelligent and have ‘knowledge’.  Only humans have concepts. Concepts and Perceptions come first, and then memory for Aristotle (This is opposite of Plato’s recollection theory).</p><p>Very Loosely empiricist.</p><p>Our concepts grow out of and make reference to sense perceptions. Sense perception is the beginning of our epistemic activity.</p><p>Sense perception and intellection breaks down in both potentiality and actuality.</p><p>The generation of these classification-concepts of genera and species form Nous.</p><p>Experience presupposes a certain cognitive activity. It isn’t simply you acting in the world. E.g. you have to be able to retain perception as memory. These are somewhat like Kant’s a priori presuppositions of the mind.</p><p>Not all animals are capable of experience according to Aristotle because they lack those foundational cognitive capacities. Experience is more than mere immediate awareness and interaction. While sentience and interaction are necessary for Experience, they are sufficient for experience, more aspects are necessary.</p><p>He is drawing the line between practical and theoretical wisdom. Certain universals must be stabilized in your soul for both of these.</p><p>The concept of horse is the ‘one’ from the ‘many’ horses which has stabilized within your soul. This is the stabilization of mental content in your soul. This is directly when you’ve come to gain knowledge. The process of abstraction and classification after many perceptions of the a class of things is what is stabilized in your soul as knowledge. The concept of ‘horseness’ is what stabilizes in your soul. That is what it means to acquire knowledge.</p><p>A plurality of concepts becomes intertwined and classified amongst themselves as well.</p><p>The soul is the patient, and the world acts upon the soul. The concept of ‘horse’ is not floating around in the world. It is something that pertains to the soul. Concepts occur and are internal to rational creatures.</p><p>Definitions and universals have no ontological status (like the Platonic forms) outside of the rational mind. They belong to the epistemic domain. Concepts are pieces of mental furniture in your soul/mind.</p><p>When you perceive Callias you are perceiving the concept of that man insofar as the universal of ‘man’ is found that in that individual (which aint much).</p><p>There is a gradual epistemic development of our concepts.</p><p>The posterior analytics:</p><p>The faculty of nous and episteme differ from one another.</p><p>Demonstration requires non-demonstratable primitive principles.</p><p>There is an isomorphism between nous/episteme and the two types of primitives, that which is deduced/demonstrated.</p><p>Difference between demonstration and definition.</p><p>Demonstrations are principles of definition.</p><p>Deduction is wider in scope that demonstration. Not all deductions are instances of demonstration, but  all demonstrations are instances of deductions.</p><p>Notes – October 5</p><p>The difference between artificial and natural substance: Tables are artificial substances and humans are natural substances.</p><p>A natural substance has internal to it the principles of motion and change (change in place, quality, etc.).</p><p>Artificial substances don’t have these principles internal to it insofar as it is artificial, but it does insofar as it happens to be made of natural substance.</p><p>Physics is very much interested in change and ‘being and non-being’.</p><p>You are actually here, but you are potentially there. “being and non-being” defines change in this way.</p><p>Luck is chance.</p><p>Physics, Book 2</p><p>Cause – uitia</p><p>Explanation is also proper.</p><p>Change is accidental to artificial substance, while change is essential to the natural substance.</p><p>It is accidental for a human to be a doctor, and not essential.</p><p>Change is when a substance loses and gains accidental features. Change in place, etc.</p><p>Aristotle is responding to Parmenides and Xeno, who claim there is no change. He needs to spend time defending change so that he can actually do science. If these eliadics are correct, and change is incoherent, then the science of physics can’t be accomplished.</p><p>Aristotle believes in levity. Things have a natural place. Some things have a natural tendency to move towards. Fire up, leaves down.</p><p>Recognizing the existence of the physical world is immediate and obvious. It needs no proof. It is axiomatic, and nous.</p><p>The monists were only stating ‘material cause’.  “Everything is water”, etc.</p><p>Aristotle thinks the natural substance is a composite of form and matter. This lends intelligibility to my substance.</p><p>Form is associated with something’s actuality. Each of us has the form of human being inhering in us, and as a consequence, we are human beings. You can’t just ‘potentially’ be a human being.</p><p>The wood of a tree is potentially a bed, but it is not actually a bed simply because it is wood. The carpenter manipulates wood to receive the form of bed.</p><p>Form and matter is applicable to all possible substance. You’ll never find a substance, sensible or otherwise, that lacks either form or matter.</p><p>Matter can be both physical stuff and in terms of potentiality.</p><p>The notion of privation is vital. It represents a specific unrealized actuality. Right now I am not at home, but I have a certain potential to go home. This is not privation in the absolute sense, only in a particular sense. I don’t have capacity to go just anywhere (like Juptiter), but I do have the capacity to go to specific places, like my home. Privation is a specific qualified sort of lacking. It entails a limit on our capacity, a limit on our potentiality.</p><p>The four causes are laying the conceptual foundation of sensible substances. All causes are applicable to all sensible substances; likely all substances.</p><p>Chance is a species of spontaneity because one involves reason and rationality, while the latter doesn’t necessarily. Aristotle will say chance and spontaneity aren’t real causes, just pseudo causes. They have a certain sort of explanatory capacity, but only in terms of their parasitism on the four causes. Aristotle thinks it is crucial to understand the status of chance and spontaneity because if we take these away from the natural world, then everything is determined. Things are predictable. Chance and spontaneity can’t be too important to the world, because otherwise the entire world would be too unpredictable and random, and you couldn’t have science of the natural world.</p><p>Aristotle wants a middle path between the extremists of determinism and skeptics who claim the world is utterly random and chaotic. Two (or more) distinct causal chains just by happenstance overlap (this is chance). The causal tracts can be account for by the four causes, but at the point of contact of multiple casual chains is an event of chance or spontaneity.</p><p>Events between two entities which are none-rational agents, it is spontaneity. Natural event.</p><p>The sort between rational agents is chance.</p><p>Matter – hule</p><p>Form – eidos (or sometimes, ‘shape’, morphe)</p><p>Hilomorphism/Hylomorphism? is what Aristotle claims. Unlike Dualism, the form and shape of soul and body are interconnected.</p><p>Bronze is the material cause of the statue. The statue happens to be made of bronze.</p><p>Notice that explanation works as well. Explanation, however, can be misleading in some sense. It has too much of an epistemic flavor to it (while this is clearly ontological). The four causes represent either represent how we understand the world, but more importantly, how the world is in itself. The four causes take ontology be primal. The four causes are part of the ontological structure of the world.</p><p>It isn’t simply how we apprehend the world, it represents the true structure of the world. Cause is better than explanation because ‘cause’ transcends the distinction between the ontological and epistemic sides the four causes. Cause captures both, and it captures the primal ontic aspect or side. Explanation doesn’t do this as well.</p><p>The formal cause represents the essence of something. It is the definition of a thing. If the fur, flesh, and hooves are the material cause of the horse, then the essential definition of horseness, four-legged, sentient creature is the formal cause. It is the arrangement of matter which has the essential f-ness properties inhere in it.</p><p>The formal cause is the specific intelligible potentially.</p><p>Material cause of house is bricks and timber. Formal cause is the place a human should live.  The final cause is the actual living in the house.</p><p>Formal cause is the potential f-ness, final cause (telos) is actual f-ness.</p><p>Reading: Physics, Book 4: Chapters 1-4, 10-14</p><p>Notes – October 7</p><p>Aristotle says that Plato has only material and formal causes (which is uncharitable).</p><p>Efficient cause – it is what we normally think of as a cause in modern day. The Efficient cause of a house is a housebuilder. The efficient cause of myself would be my parents.</p><p>For artificial substances, the idea of the house is external to the house, and it inheres in the artificer/technician/the agent engaged in applying techne (art or craft) to bring that artifact about.</p><p>Techne- agent, means, and an end.</p><p>Natural substances are brought into being (have efficient causes) by other natural substances.</p><p>The agent is that who brings about motion or change (in a loose sense).</p><p>The matter required for healing, medicine, is the material cause, a necessary condition for healing to occur.</p><p>Final Cause is the end. It is central to the philosophy of nature.</p><p>In the case of the house, the final cause is the realization of the formal cause, namely people living the house.</p><p>The Final cause is the realization of something essence. The formal cause sets out that essence.</p><p>Everything is seeking to fulfill its final cause. The fact is that everything is seeking to do so. Final Cause is a teleological.</p><p>In chance, neither casual track entails overlapping another. If it did, then it wasn’t chance.</p><p>The four causes are applicable to substance, but they are equally applicable to activity.</p><p>Activity = energeia</p><p>Telos = end (in the sense of perfection) It isn’t a temporal end, it is realizing specific capacities/definition.</p><p>Everything is trying to imitate God. To be perfect. To be the end.</p><p>There are activities where means and end coincide, and those where they don’t. Those which don’t coincide a weaker and not complete. Activities need efficient causes, namely agents seeking to bring about what is caused. It isn’t accidental.</p><p>Formal is potential, Final is actualization. But, even if it isn’t actualized, Final cause isn’t a potential, it is actual.</p><p>No substance, sensible or otherwise, is outside the domain of these causes.</p><p>Chance is a species of spontaneity.  What is common about both of them, both can be understood indirectly in terms of the four causes. Each causal chain has its own four causes. The four causes are applicable to all activity that substance engages in.</p><p>Chance for rational agents.</p><p>I didn’t goto the store to payback 50 bucks to someone I met there by chance. I had different ends I was trying to realize that was completely independent of the chance phenomena that emerges.</p><p>Chance occurs at the single point of intersection and contact of two independent causal chain. Each causal chain had specific ends independent of this crossroads of chance. The chance event is the coincidental overlaps of these independent causal chains.</p><p>Chance is understandable in terms of each of the independent causal trains.</p><p>The point of chance-contact (or lucky event) itself is not a proper cause though.</p><p>The chance explanation is parasitic upon the other four causes being in place. Chance events only emerge when the four proper causes are already being applied to the two independent causal chains. Chance pre-supposes the four causes. Because chance is parasitic on the four causes, it is merely a pseudo-cause. Strictly speaking, chance is not a cause though.</p><p>Chance= Causal chains of rational beings.</p><p>Spontaneity= Causal chains of non-rational beings.</p><p>Chance and Spontaneity emerge from the application of the four causes to substances. It is entirely coincidental. Chance and Spontaneity are only explainable in terms of the four causes.</p><p>It is coincidental because nothing about either causal chain entailed that it would overlap with the other.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>In nature, certain things re-occur. E.g. it is necessary that the sun rise tomorrow (unlike Hume). Nature has built into some necessary components.</p><p>If the phenomena of the world weren’t intelligible and necessary to some extent, then you can’t do philosophy or physics or science.</p><p>Levity – bodies in the natural world have a natural place. Fire moves up. Earth moves downwards.  </p><p>Enlightenment science called Levity and Teleology ‘bullshit’.</p><p>For certain things to come about, they require certain materials to be in place.

A housebuilder has the definition of house inhere within him – house is an artificial substance.</p><p>Hypothetical necessity sets out what is necessary for something to come about.</p><p>1.Material Cause – what it is made of         </p><p>2.Formal Cause- the potential purpose, definition of the thing </p><p>3.Efficient Cause-the agent which brings it about </p><p>4.Final Cause-the realization of the purpose, actuality of the definition </p><p>Notes – October 11, 2010</p><p>Time is an image of eternity. Parmenides denies time though. Aristotle thinks that time is the measurement of change.</p><p>Physics, book 4, chapter 4:</p><p>Place is not a part of the object. It is that which surrounds the extremities of the object. It doesn’t change alongside an object which is moving.</p><p>Place is something that always accompanies an object. You’ll never find an instance of a sensible substance which isn’t in ‘place’. In part, that is what it means to be a substance, to occupy place.</p><p>In time, the now is a demarcation, a value, a separating value between past and present.</p><p>Place is essential to the notion of motion and change. You can understand locomotion without understanding place, for example. Place, like time, pertains to this notion of measuring. Time is how ensouled creatures measure change; time presupposes and depends upon alteration, including alterations in place.</p><p>Place is not shape. Shape moves with an object, but place does not. Place is still a boundary though, just not a boundary like shape.</p><p>Place is separable from the thing and what contains it, but not matter.</p><p>Place is not part of the body. Locomotion is the changing of place.</p><p>Place is neither form, nor matter, nor extension.</p><p>We can measure things in time (in virtue of place). Place and time are both necessary components if one is going to understand sensible substance.</p><p>The area/extremities an substance occupies is place. It is inseparable from you, but not a part of you. You can’t properly understand yourself without allowing for the notion that you occupy place.</p><p>Locomotion is understood in terms of actuality and potentiality. Locomotion is an incomplete form of actuality because it isn’t completely realized because you have the potentiality to be somewhere else, but you are actually here.</p><p>Place is a thing’s boundaries. You don’t have boundaries surrounding nothing, only boundaries surrounding things that exist.</p><p>Place isn’t a part of an object, but you can’t understand an object without an account of place.</p><p>Place is conceptually necessary distinctions required for change. The physics is primarily about change.</p><p>In the physics, even though God is not spatial or temporal, God presents itself in Books 7 and 8, God’s presence is still felt in the sensible realm in terms of being an unmoved mover. God is tied into Aristotle’s teleological account of nature. Everything is moved by God, and everything is trying to be like God. In the metaphysics, God will be self-thinking thought, but from the perspective of physics, we see God as the unmoved mover.</p><p>Midterm responsibility: Category, Posterior Analytics, and Physics Books 2 and Book 4, Chapters 1-4, 10, 14</p><p>The now is what demarcates the past from the future. The status of the now is interesting because, in a way, it isn’t a part of time, but rather it is a boundary. This is similar to how place is not a part of an object.</p><p>The future and the past don’t exist. The ‘now’ is where the past ceases and the future begins. Time is parasitic upon change. We use it to measure change.</p><p>Time is the number of change.</p><p>Change is wider in scope to Aristotle than mere change in place. It must also include change in time.</p><p>Time encompasses all types of movement and all types of change. There isn’t a different time here and a parallel time somewhere else. Time is the number qua change.</p><p>Time is the measurement of all types of movement and alteration.</p><p>Time is one in kind. Two sets of ten dogs, what they share in common in their ten-ness. Two different events related to time in the same way. There is only one ten, there is only one time.</p><p>Sensible substances cannot be properly understood without time, just as place. Time and place are the necessary conditions for properly comprehending the nature and state of sensible substances, they are in a state of change.</p><p>In two causal chains where one is a sentient and the other not, we can view this event from either chance or spontaneity, depending on which chain you focus upon. Chance and Spontaneity have explanatory force, but they aren’t strictly causes because they are contingent upon the four causes being in place. Each causal chain can be broken down in terms of the four causes—in this case, chance/spontaneity are external.</p><p>Primary substance, particular sensible substances, members of the various species. Actual physical object.</p><p>Properties inhere a subject, but you aren’t that quantum or property. It merely inheres in you. You are much more than that. They aren’t your essence, they are accidental. They are essentially accidental though, in that you have to have them. They are accidental in that you are not a specific weight in virtue of being a human being. They are essentially accidental in that you have to have instances of those properties, e.g. you have to have some weight.</p><p>Whiteness doesn’t walk down the street. You have white things walking down the street. The crucial thing of substance is that it is the subject of which things are predicated of it.</p><p>Concept formation is when a concept is stabilized in your soul. Usually a plurality of concepts are formed at once. The have the capacity to acquire concepts.</p><p>For the paper:</p><p>Is there a difference in how the four causes relate to primary substance and secondary substance?</p><p>For secondary substance:</p><p>Formal cause is species, Matter is material cause. Final and efficient are conceptually there. God is efficient cause as highest logical principle, but not the creator of the species. God grounds them. The final cause is the realization of those species.</p><p>What were the exact passages for the four causes, chance/spontaneity?</p><p>Physics, Book 2?, Chapter 3 and 4.</p><p>Reading - De Anima – Book 2 – Account of the soul, also Book 3, Chapters 1-5;  Sensible substances qua soul.

The two capacities they have is the capacities they have are the ability to take in nutrition and reproduce.  </p><p>The second level is ‘animal’. They have additional capacities that the vegititive creatures do not (but also include the vegititive capacities). Animals have the capacity for sense perception, and also motion (excluding sponges, which aren’t capable of locomotion, but certainly have touch – it was a mindfuck for Aristotle).</p><p>The top of the pyramid would be humans (and God), they have all the capacities below them, but they also have the capacity for intellection and rational discourse.</p><p>God is awkward here in that he has intellection, but lacks a body, and so doesn’t have the capacities of the lower creatures on the pyramid.</p><p>Chapter 7 of book 1 will explain 2.5 – It shows the difference between psychological alteration and physical alteration. One is about contradictions destroying each other (coldness destroying the hotness in a thing), the psychological alteration sets out something different in this case.</p><p>The hylomorphist position will see the soul as a certain sort of potentiality of a certain sort of body. The soul will represent certain psychological capacities. This is done in 3 steps. The definition of soul:</p><p>1st Potentiality       </p><p>1st Actuality/2nd Potentiality (they are the same thing) – Having knowledge but not exercising it. - E.g. the Sleeping geometer</p><p>2nd Actuality – Actually exercising the knowledge you have. – e.g. the geometer at work</p><p>This is the soul and all of its functions.</p><p>The soul is the form of the relevant matter (the body). Aristotle is responding to the Platonists (dualists) and certain presocratic thinkers who reduce soul to material?</p><p>Ensouled entities are compounds, both form and matter.</p><p>Matter can be spoken of in two ways. 1.) The material cause. The physical stuff. The stuff of which things are made. 2.) The notion of potentiality. The intellect in terms of potentiality is the material intellect. This isn’t the intellect made of physical stuff, but rather the potentiality (which serves as the material) of the intellect.</p><p>For Aristotle, dealing with Hypothetical necessity entails that all souls must inhere in a specific sort of body. Andriods, for example, cannot have a soul because they don’t have the correct sort of body.</p><p>You can make a saw out of wool, but it is a terrible saw.</p><p>The soul represents the specific psychological capacities that a specific composite body possesses and the way in which it can act.</p><p>The faculty of sight, for instance, although the power to see is distinct from the organ which empowers it, it is nevertheless completely dependent upon the organ (the eye) to exist. Most capacities, with the exception of the intellect, require an organ or a physical component, and essentially, a certain sort of body.</p><p>You need the relevant body/material cause in question to have the capacity.</p><p>Soul is the first actuality of a certain sort of body.</p><p>Aristotle has the soul at the 1st actuality so you can ‘go to sleep’ and not always having to fully realize your potentiality 24/7.</p><p>The notion that the soul and body could be distinct is just a notion. It is the ability of rational creatures to abstract in thought alone…conceptually we can do it, but in reality we cannot.</p><p>Certain forms require matter, but cannot be reduced to that matter. The soul and its capacities cannot be realized without specific matter (a certain sort of body). But, the soul can’t be reduced to it.</p><p>The capacity of sight requires eyeballs, but it can’t be reduced to eyeballs. If they were, then you could rip out some eyeballs, and those eyeballs could still see.</p><p>Corpses aren’t human beings because they no longer the relevant capacities to be human. They lack vegititive states, sense perception and intellectual capacities.</p><p>Soul + Body = animal, to be alive</p><p>The axe, obviously doesn’t have a soul. We can only speak of it analogously.</p><p>Many things are developed from have sense perception, including imagination and appetition; pleasure and pain; and desire.</p><p>Aristotle is claiming that Plato’s dualism makes the soul’s body accidental.</p><p>A soul requires a certain sort of body that can actually have the necessary capacities.</p><p>Plants – Nutrition</p><p>Animals – Nutrition, Sense Perception</p><p>Humans – Nutrition, Sense Perception, and intellection.</p><p>Book 2.5: sets out the clear conceptual distinction about how sense perception operates.</p><p>The perceiver (the patient) and the perceptible object (the agent which acts upon the patient).</p><p>Sensation is a change in quality or alteration – affection – of the perceiver.</p><p>Perceptibles are external to the perceiver.</p><p>The perceptible goes under a pseudo-change when it is perceived. It moves from potentially perceived to actually perceived.</p><p>Likeness and unlikeness are essential to both perception and intellection. Prior to perceiving the whiteboard vs. actually perceiving it.</p><p>You acquire sensible forms, becoming like it.</p><p>In some sense, the perceiver is ‘whitened’ when perceiving a whiteboard.</p><p>Notes – October 25</p><p>1st potentiality is the most removed, the 2nd actuality is the most realized.</p><p>1st potentiality and 2nd actuality are the same thing.</p><p>Agent and perceiver are both changed.</p><p>Aristotle is showing us the nature of perceptual affection, as opposed to nature of physical affection that happens in the world (whereby you see one contrary destroying another contrary). This is not how perception affection/alteration occurs. For Aristotle, Perceptual affection is not a matter of one thing destroying another, but rather, it is a matter of something’s capacity being realized and preserved.</p><p>Aristotle has in the mind is one’s awareness of the object you are perceiving.</p><p>The five senses are all analogous to each other in their structure.</p><p>Sight, patient is seer, object is the colored thing, the medium is the transparent.</p><p>For Aristotle, ‘the void’ is impossible because it would undermine perception as a whole. Therefore, we say Aristotle is a “plentum” theorist.</p><p>The colored thing moves the transparent which then affects the faculty in question, namely sight.</p><p>If there was a void between the colored thing and the faculty, you couldn’t perceive and the colored thing couldn’t affect the perceiver because there is an incommensurable gulf between the two.</p><p>There is a change in quality with respect to the perceiver. The perceiver takes on the relevant form. Sight becomes ‘colored’ in someway by the colored object affecting sight.</p><p>Perception is a certain sort of causal process whereby the perceptible acts upon the patient. The whiteboard acts upon me (the perceiver). The perception occurs in me. The whiteboard affects my faculty of sight. I move from potentially seeing something to actually seeing something.</p><p>To perceive is to take on the sensible form of something. Do you literally do it? Metaphorically do it? DO you literally become colored? In what sense are you colored? How do you cash out the “taking on the sensible form” of that which you perceive. You do become aware of the thing you perceive in a strong sense. Perhaps, there is a ‘color’ occurring within the eye itself.</p><p>Prior to perceiving the whiteboard, your faculty is unlike it, but potentially unlike it. Once you start perceiving it, your sight becomes like it. It takes on the sensible form of it. Going from the state of being potentially like the sensible form to actually like the sensible form is what is happening in perception.</p><p>The nature of physical thing doesn’t change, only the ‘potentially seen’ to ‘actually seen’.</p><p>Your faculty of sight is whitened when looking at a whiteboard in terms of the sensible form. The whiteboard, however, always has that whiteness.</p><p>The 1st actuality isn’t extinguished when you move to the 2nd actuality, as you still maintain the capacity of the 1st actuality.</p><p>There is a causal structure to two types of change. Perception, as patients/subjects are aware of the alteration which are conscious of the change, undergo changes different from the sort whereby contradictions destroy each other without awareness.</p><p>Perception is of particulars. Knowledge is of universals. The objects of knowledge aren’t external to us in the same that the objects of perception are external to us. Intellection is different from sensation in this way, but structurally, they are similar.</p><p>You cannot hear colors, or see sounds. Each of the five senses has a proper object that is unique to it; special sensible. There are also common sensibles which are accessible by more than one sense. E.g. you can see, hear, and feel emotion at the same time.</p><p>You can’t be wrong about taking on the sensible form in perception. You aren’t wrong about perceiving an actual object, but you can be wrong about the judgments you make from that perception. The fact that the agent acts upon the patient, you can’t be wrong about. You are ‘aware’ that you’ve been affected.</p><p>Perception is pregnant with awareness.</p><p>Common sensible are accessible to more than one sense in any particular instance.  Color is special because you can only see it. Being the son of Diares is incidental to whiteness inhering in him. Whiteness could inhere in most anything. To perceive the object as the son of Diares is incidental, to perceive the whiteness.</p><p>Structure of perception: Agent, medium, and patient.</p><p>In some way the transparent between my sight and the whiteboard is altered. Exactly how the medium is altered is fairly controversial.</p><p>The object sets in motion the medium which enables the medium to affect me the perceiver. A 3rd party can’t see whiteness traveling through the air at my faculty of sight, so the medium is only affected in a certain way.</p><p>You can’t see the transparent in and of itself, you only see what the transparent conveys. Transparency is not the color, only that which serves as a necessary condition for the color. Think “Sun” analogy.</p><p>Both air and water can serve as the medium – anything which has the property of transparency can serve as that medium.</p><p>Transparent isn’t a body, otherwise you can’t see through it. It is only that which can transmit qua medium the relevant properties of the agent. You can’t have two substances in each other, metaphysically speaking.</p><p>If the transparent were a particular color, then it would not have the capacity to be the color of something else.</p><p>Notes – October 27, 2010</p><p>The Theaetetus is limited exclusively in scope to the domain of knowledge. And, this is why it is so influential to the De Anima. 3 accounts of knowledge are considered. Knowledge is sense perception; knowledge is true belief; knowledge is true belief with an account. These are refuted by Plato (through Socrates’ mouth).</p><p>The sense is never wrong about the special object in question (2.6) – he gets this from Plato. Plato denies ‘being’ in the predicative sense to the five senses.</p><p>Plato says the following:</p><p>Being in 3 senses:</p><p>Predicative – X is Y</p><p>Existential –X exists</p><p>Veridical – X is true</p><p>Because the senses cannot be wrong, it can never formulate a proposition. You can’t be wrong about a color, so you can’t state a proposition about the color. As soon as you can formulate a proposition, falsity and truth come into play. If you say ‘the moon is flat’, you are making a proposition, which is subject to truth values.</p><p>Truth is not applicable to the senses, to Plato. Sense perception, then, cannot be knowledge. Knowledge does not occur at the level of the senses, only at a higher level.</p><p>Aristotle responds to this. Aristotle has the ‘common sense’ as the focal point of consciousness where the senses meet.</p><p>Aristotle is a Plentum theorist, there is no void, otherwise the causal structure would be destroyed.</p><p>Color sets the transparent in movement, as a result, the seer can see it.</p><p>Is the seer metaphorically or literally colored? B2.7 seems in favor of the literalist view.</p><p>The reason I don’t see the greenness of the wall transmitted through the transparent towards some other patient is that I’m not at the right angle, and that patient is.</p><p>The color itself is in no way affected by you seeing it. Green of the wall doesn’t fade because we are perceiving it. The transparent doesn’t see the green because it doesn’t have the proper apparatus required for sense perception.  The medium does not sense.</p><p>Where I recognize a thing is what it is, and how we join together sense perceptions of a thing is the common sense.</p><p>Perceiver consists in the organ and the form of that organ. Form is the power of the organ, and it is not reducable to the matter. Organ is a necessary condition for the ion of its form. Organ and form of organ should not be conflated. The form inheres within the organ.</p><p>B2.12 – You receive the sensible form without the matter. You are don’t become the whiteboard, but you take on the sensible form without the matter. Become aware of the white thing without becoming a white thing.</p><p>The excess of using a faculty can damage it.</p><p>He demarcates these distinct causal paths of each of the senses. When the air moves and splits the tree of thunder, but you hearing the thunder is a distinct thing.</p><p>Perception is taking on the sensible form without the matter.</p><p>Each sense has access to a specific sensible form. That sensible form is unique to that sense. You don’t see sounds, you don’t hear colors, you don’t touch flavors.</p><p>3.1 – The senses have equal epistemological status. None of the senses take precedence, epistemically, over the others.</p><p>Earth is the crudest of the four elements. Organs are made up of one of the natural elements. Earth, Air, water, fire. All organs are physics. The organ represents the material cause.</p><p>Notes – November 1, 2010</p><p>The focal point of perceptual awareness.  You are conscious that the bile is bitter and yellow. You don’t think it is two things just because it has two properties. The properties aren’t identical with each other, but they do both exist within the same entity.</p><p>If we didn’t have this common sense, we couldn’t function in the world. What you would be lacking is an apprehension of the unity of substance. If you lack that apprehension, you’ll bump into a lot of things. You will lack the notion of ‘thingness’. It is fundamental to our perceptual awareness.</p><p>In 3.2, he explores how we can have the unity of our senses without undermining the Aristotelian rules of perception operate. We can be aware that we are seeing without falling into an infinite regress.</p><p>The focal point of consciousness occurs at the unity of the sense perception.</p><p>The senses don’t form judgments, they can’t be wrong. If you don’t have awareness in a sense, you have to continually look for what is aware (infinite regress).</p><p>Sense perception and intellection are object oriented. You can’t understand the epistemic acts without making reference to the ontic world.</p><p>You can’t understand the self in isolation from the world.</p><p>1st and 2nd actuality is applicable to both the object and the perception. A sounding object isn’t being fully an object with sound if it isn’t being heard.</p><p>Excess senses destroy the perception.</p><p>The five senses do not generate 5 selves. If they did, then you couldn’t intelligibly perceive the world.</p><p>There is a conceptual distinction between the senses, not an actual one. They are actually unified, and they also have a unifying concept.</p><p>Senses are unified in the soul – it is the common sense. Common sense is over and above the 5 senses, namely the awareness that you are sensing the same thing with your different senses.</p><p>The unification of the common sense enables Aristotle to deny that you have 2 or more senses for the same object (and has 2 or more selves).</p><p>He treats the senses as having the same structure, as if they all adhere to the same conceptual apparatus.</p><p>Built into sense perception is awareness; it is pregnant with awareness. Sense perception is to be aware of an object you perceive.</p><p>Identity is central to understanding the intellect. He raises “self-intellection” itself. This is natural from “intellection” becoming its object. Intellection becoming the object of intellection.</p><p>Notes – November 3, 2010</p><p>Passive and Active intellect – 3.4 and 3.5</p><p>Koina aesthesis (common sense)</p><p>The data from your senses is unified at the perception level. Common sense is part of that perception level. The 5 senses give us the data, the common sense unifies the data. Each of the five senses is incapable of falsehood. At the level of the 5 senses, propositional judgments are not formulated.</p><p>The intellect does not have an organ.</p><p>The intellect can’t be affected be affected by perceptibles or take in nutrition. The intellect is only capable of being affected by intelligibles. Can’t think of perceptibles insofar as they aren’t intelligible.</p><p>Particulars are intelligible are understandable insofar as they participate in the forms.</p><p>The intellect couldn’t think all things if it is actually a thing. It couldn’t think about the thing it is. It is potentially all the intelligibles, but it isn’t actually any of them. 1st potentiality intellect here.</p><p>The intellect has the capacity to take on the intelligibles. Material intellect, the power to take on actual intelligible form.</p><p>The form of the intellect is such that it isn’t found in an organ, whereas all the other powers other soul require an organ or physical component.</p><p>The intellect is pure potentiality. Nature is like a blank canvas in that it has pure potential to take on the intelligibles. It is passive in the sense that it is strictly the capacity to think (not perceive or anything else). It is passive because it is a capacity, passive because it has the potential to be realized and actualized and have a greater ontological status.</p><p>The lesser intelligbles are deduced from the higher intelligbles (principles). So, to focus your intellect on the higher intelligible will allow you to understand the lesser intellible more clearly. This isn’t, the case, for perception.</p><p>Once you have acquired knowledge (1st actuality) you are able to think of those things on your ownb, you don’t need to be retaught. “through yourself” The intellgibles have become a part of your mental furniture.</p><p>For us, we are first potentially intellectual and only later actually intellectual. For other things in metaphysics, though, it must first be actual. God is always actual and active, not passive or potential.</p><p>You have the capacity ot think of waterness in isolation from the external world, but you also have the capacity to understand and apprehend the water in the world.</p><p>Matter is the principle of individuation.</p><p>Factors: Epistemic thought and the subject which thinks them. To be a subject and to be an object are distinct conceptual things.</p><p>What is the locus of the intellect? What is the mind/body relationship?</p><p>Notes – November 8</p><p>What is the thinkable about a thing is not qua matter, but qua what is intelligible.</p><p>Tabula Rasa is the intellect at the level of the 1st potentiality. When the tabula rasa is written upon, it becomes different, the 2nd potentiality. Even though it is written upon, the tabula is never reduced to what is written upon it, otherwise you couldn’t think about anything else.</p><p>The intellect does become its object when it is actually thinking. Just because it becomes its object, the intellect, however, is more than just that object (otherwise you couldn’t take on other objects).</p><p>The intellect is not always self-aware. When it is thinking of itself, it is opaque, and it only incidentally ‘becomes’ that very thing. It thinks of intelectness.</p><p>Intellectual geography of subject and object.</p><p>Intellection is object oriented. Objects take precedence over subjects.</p><p>How is the intellect impassable? It can only be affected by intelligibles. It can be affected qua sensibles, only qua intellible form. It is passable in that it can undergo alteration. From potentialities to the actualities.</p><p>The passive intellect is like the matter, which the active intellect forms and arranges. An agent and a patient. The passive intellect is the potentiality which can be actualized. The active intellect which brings that about.</p><p>The art serves as a necessary condition to the potentiality of the material to be converted to actuality.</p><p>The active intellect is like light. It is like that which brings about or enables the passive intellect to be realized. Active intellect is like the sun – the necessary condition to activating the potentiality of the passive intellect into actuality. It enables the intellect to realize and fulfill its end (teleology).</p><p>An aspect of the active intellect is in us.</p><p>We don’t seem to be aware of the active intellect within us. Sometimes we are aware of being active, and sometimes not. So this seems awkward. It is unclear as to the relationship between the passive and active intellect, particularly with regards to our apprehension.</p><p>Active intellect is certainly God (Aristotle’s God).  It is the divine intellect.</p><p>Actuality comes first. God is eternally in this state. There is a never a point in time at which God is not in a state of actual intellection. Metaphysically, actuality has to be prior to potentiality. If it wasn’t, and potentiality was prior, then why would things start?</p><p>If you do have a part of the active intellect, it isn’t what we understand by ourselves or our personal history of thought and intellection.</p><p>Notes – Missed Class</p><p>The Metaphysics</p><p>Book 1 chapter 1</p><p>Being qua being Aristotle’s metaphysics is what he regards the highest science because it looks at being in its purest form. Unlike the de anima, we will encounter God but will do so by looking at God’s unique activity.  We will look at God is his purest form.</p><p>Book I looks at Aristotle’s predecessors.  The first set came up with material cause then formal cause.</p><p>All men by nature desire to know.  Human beings by nature desire to know; according to nature, we desire to know.  That is the sort of creature that we are. From an Aristotelian perspective human beings evolve.  We are rational creatures. </p><p>Sight is apprehends things in their unity and division simultaneously.  Sight is also an event that you engage in for its own sake.  You appreciate the beautiful landscape.  It is an end in itself. </p><p>The ancients love bees because the beehive is a very organized setting where everyone has a proper function.  The hive as a whole produces honey. </p><p>Animals other than man is not capable of reason.  Experience requires reason because there is a certain coherence to  experience.  It is not simply a series of disconnect events.  That is why reason is required.  Of other animals they have little experience and their experience is contingent upon memory.</p><p>Many memories produce a single experience.  If experience were simply a series of completely disconnected happenings, it would not have that coherence. Concept formation  in the metaphysics is going to be the conceptual odyssey.</p><p>This is a matter of art (techne) reason is organizing and arranging the matter to come up with a certain end.  The art of medicine embraces every member of that human set.  Experience pertains to that to particular where techne is to universal.  In the practical domain experience is more beneficial than techne. </p><p>The formal have conceptual grasp of the specific, of the causes of the specific domain. </p><p>The men of experience Techne they grasp the causes the why of that domain. One can be said to have knowledge when we grasp the cause.  He is setting up the intelligible structure. </p><p>Ousia is derived from the Greek participle.  Each of us as a substance is a being. Each of us is something which is.  In this context, we are looking at substance in its purest form. </p><p>The senses do not give us wisdom because they only reveal that X is the case but not why X is the case.  For why you have to grasp the conceptual knowledge.  the cause of something.  it explains for example the house.  Only when we have the four causes that we properly understand what the house.  Sight tells you that it is but not the causal structure.  Only the latter that offers us wisdom.  Having theoretical grasp of houses; the senses are not sufficient.  Aitia=cause or explanation. </p><p>The crucial distinction the techne that deal with utility are lesser.  Their techne are not a means to a certain end.  Things that deal with utility are simply a means to an end.  Things that do not deal with utility are an ends in themselves. Physical education you exercise as a means to an end to be in shape and healthy. The art of metaphysician as an end in itself, you do not do it for some other end. Certain activities in which the end is external to that activity, that activity is simply a means to an end.  You do not engage in metaphysics for an end which is external to that activity.  In that activity the means and an end coincide.  This activity the (energia) where the means and the ends coincide it is a more unified activity. </p><p>The higher activities are only accessible to those who are at leisure.  That is why Aristotle cites the Egyptian priest class; whereas those that are simply driven by necessity cannot engage in that activity.   Life of Socrates had wealthy friends who had a lot of money, Socrates does not have to have a job. </p><p>You judge the intrinsic value of an activity whether the end and the means coincide or as a means to an external end. </p><p>First causes and principles of things.  Metaphysics focuses of first causes.  That is why he goes through the history.  The first are the materialist, he then turns to Plato, et al. there we see the formal cause.  None of his predecessors, from Aristotle’s perspective properly had a grasp of the four causes.  It is necessary to have a grasp of all four causes.  If not you are not capable of grasping being as such. </p><p>Theoretical knowledge is more value than practical knowledge.  you do not build houses for the sake of building houses but to produce things for human beings to live in.  in the case of the theoretical sciences they are an end in themselves. Metaphysics is the highest theoretical science.  More than any other science has the claim of wisdom.</p><p>Science of getting a hold of its causes and its principles.  That is why this science has the greatest claim on wisdom.  We are looking at substance in its purest form.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Book II, chapter 1(a)</p><p>Aristotle is setting up his predecessors where he says it is easy to hit on an aspect of the truth.  It is hard to get the entire picture.  As a whole they contributed quite a bit, but not individually.  Although, he got the idea of the four causes from Plato.</p><p>He is setting up the entirety of truth with respect to being.  That is what he means by setting out all of the causes and principles. </p><p>The paragraph starts with Perhaps. We move from the most intelligible to us to the least intelligible to us. (Reference to the Posterior Analytics) This he gets from Plato.</p><p>Aristotle sees his predecessors certain essential contributions, they offer necessary building blocks. </p><p>Theoretical knowledge grasps the eternal necessary truths.  Practical knowledge pertains to that which can be otherwise. The law of non-contradiction is not sometimes true and other times not.  It is always the case.     </p><p>In the De Anima when you grasp things that are more intelligible, things that are less intelligible derive from the things that are higher.  Lesser are dependent upon the higher, logically speaking.  When you get to the intelligible world being an truth are intimate. </p><p>Book II, 2</p><p>For Aristotle the causes cannot go on ad infinitum.  That results something being unintelligible.  Everything has a first cause. If you take away the first cause you destroy the causal structure.</p><p>Read for Monday through the end of Book 4.</p><p>Notes – November 15, 2010</p><p>Can’t have infinite regress of causes. Otherwise, science is unintelligible to Aristotle.</p><p>Book 4, line 1. Metaphysics is being qua being. Studying ‘being’ (substance) in its purest form and its attributes. All the other science deal with ‘being’ in its particular substance/context. Physics, being in terms of motion and change. De anima, being in terms of the soul. This is being qua being.</p><p>God is the pinnacle, the highest substance, of metaphysics. Plato would say ‘the good’, but Aristotle has self-thinking thought.</p><p>The law/principle of non-contradiction is essential to theother science. The metaphysics outlines it. Without that principle, you can understand ‘being’ and ‘substance’ in general.  The sophists sometimes failed to realize this in their own philosophies, thus they were fundamentally flawed (their arguments, at any rate).</p><p>Can’t hold contrary beliefs simultaneously, at the same time, in the same way.</p><p>Relativism leads to inherent contradictions. “Every belief you hold is true”, then the belief that the claim is false is then true, and thus it is self-refuting. Thus, plato/Aristotle, think that Protagoras was wrong.</p><p>Aristotle is setting out the foundation for the highest science. The other science have to presuppose these principles, the science of being qua being actually addresses these principles.</p><p>The law of contradiction gives a framework for us to interpret ‘being’ and ‘not-being’ and how things relate in this way.</p><p>You can potentially be X and not X, but you can’t actually be X and not X.</p><p>In Book 4.7 – Contradictories and contraries are different. Contradictories, one has to be true, and one has to be false. There is no middle ground. Contraries have a middle ground, such as black and white, but none of it “has” to be true.</p><p>Contradictory – One predicate is true and the opposite is false. No middle ground. One or the other.</p><p>Contrary – Middle ground between the extremes. A continuum.</p><p>Law of excluded middle shows how contradictories are such that A or ~A. This law is the opposite side of the same coin.</p><p>Language reflects ‘being’ and ‘not being’.</p><p>Book 6:</p><p>Aristotle sets out why Physics is not a part of metaphysics. Metaphysics can’t be reduced to physics or mathematics.</p><p>If there were only natural substances, then physics would be the highest substance. As there are unnatural / non-physical substances, then metaphysics is the highest.</p><p>There cannot be a science of the accidental. The categories, substance, potentiality, and actuality are all necessary conditions to understanding the highest science. You can’t, however, have a science of the accidental.</p><p>Notes – November 22</p><p>Book 7:</p><p>Finding a this, but not in the same way that natural substances are a this.</p><p>Techne applies the form to the matter.</p><p>Form doesn’t have to refer to matter. Pure form, for example. Matter in this context isn’t a constituent of a composite.</p><p>Metaphysically, the whole has to be prior to the parts. A this, the substance, is prior to the parts. The parts are understood in relation to the whole.</p><p>What ontological requirement to universals lack: independent existence. Whiteness itself is not independent, but the whiteness that inheres in me, in some sense, does exist independently?</p><p>Substance which consists of form is eternal and doesn’t break down in the way that sensible, composite substances breakdown.</p><p>There is not a formula of substances that have matter. There isn’t a definition and science of an individual substance insofar as it is accidental. We come under a formula as a member of a set or species. There is a science of human beings, but not of any individual human beings, otherwise that individual would exhaust the definition of (e.g.) human being.</p><p>In the case of these primary substances, the essence and the substance is identical. That is different from what we see as primary substance in the categories.</p><p>Sensible substance, form and matter.</p><p>New sort of primary substance is obviously different (between Metaphysic and categories). Primary substance is just form, it doesn’t have the same sort of relation to matter as the sensible substances.</p><p>Insofar as it is matter, it is an object of thought. Each of us are not thinkable in the same way that the concept of the species of human is thinkable. Sensible things aren’t limited to and exhausted by their intelligible aspects.</p><p>Natural substances no longer qualify as primary substance for Aristotle in the metaphysics. Here we enter the domain of being qua being. We need a new type of substance that can operate in this domain. There are various reasons we need this new substance.</p><p>This new sort of substance serves as an object of thought in a way that sensible substances do not. There are certain requirements to “energai” or “activity” of the highest substance such that it might be able to have as its proper object a certain sort of object. Pure form substance is very related to thinking.</p><p>The notion of a definition is what is one as such. He is revising what Plato discusses about how parts relates to the whole. Is there a unity in a different manner? The nature of unity is being worked out here.</p><p>Matter now takes the form of genus. So, it isn’t like the matter of sensible substances.</p><p>Chapter 13:</p><p>Universals do not properly qualify as a substance.</p><p>Chapter 15:</p><p>Formuli, primary substances are eternal. They are the proper objects of intellection.</p><p>In one interpretation, they are what they highest substance will contemplate.</p><p>Substance does not admit of agree, so these aren’t more substance-ey than the other substances. They are simply different. The domain of being qua being requires this new type of substance.</p><p>Natural substance is the proper subject of being qua being because they possess things which fall outside that domain. Accidental attributes are unintelligible aspects of these natural substances, which makes them unfit for being qua being.</p><p>Natural substances are destructible. Knowledge is about what is eternal (otherwise is like opinion). Knowledge of natural substances is problematic because natural substance can both be and not be. Knowledge about the pure form primary substance makes sense because these will be eternal.</p><p>The true actuality of these pure form primary substances is having them be thought by God, highest substance, self-thinking thought.</p><p>There is nothing higher than God’s activity.</p><p>Divine activity is theoretical contemplation. That must be God is doing. If we partake in that divine activity when we are thinking, then a bit of God is in us.</p><p>Chapter 17:</p><p>The divine substance has to be a first cause; not in the sense of creator, but in the Aristotelian scheme, God can be thought of the first cause because He is that in virtue of which things can be properly understood. Unmoved mover. Everything is trying to reach God.</p><p>Primary substances aren’t properly discreet parts. They seem to be unified in some way. My form and matter, if so, I would cease to be a substance. The sense in which my parts of form and matter are not separable is also found (in a parallel way) in primary substances (the new).</p><p>Is the whole reducible to its parts, or is it over and above its parts. Aristotle thinks that metaphysically-speaking it must be the latter. In what sense is a substance ‘one’?</p><p>We are both ‘one’ and ‘many’. We can dissect a substance conceptually, by its parts. But, in another sense, you are unified and you can’t actually separate them.</p><p>God is the ultimate form. The ultimate ‘why’. The ultimate cause. God is the ultimate final cause.</p><p>Thin interpretation: God isn’t thinking about the intelligible structure of reality, just thinking about Himself. It lacks explanatory force in answering the causal questions that the richer interpretation has.</p><p>God must necessarily think of Himself; we ask, “what is meant by that?”</p><p>What is more knowable, the whole or its elements? In a sense, the elements because they are simpler. In other sense, the whole. Substance, like the whole, seems most knowable.</p><p>Notes – November 29</p><p>Book 9 and 10 setup the potentiality and actuality distinction.</p><p>9.2 – The doctor potentially makes you healthy or sicker. It is accidental when the doctor makes the mistake, he doesn’t intend to make the mistake or make you sicker.</p><p>A shit doctor and shit diagnoses is accidental to the art of medicine.</p><p>Substance in its truest form are separable material substances. ‘Being qua being’ is more applicable to those sorts of substances than sensible substances.</p><p>Platonic forms belong to the realm of being; eternal, unchanging, and simple. Things of this realm are the ‘realm of becoming’ in a constant state of change.</p><p>Ice only cools things. Fire only heats things. Reason has potential to go in different ways.</p><p>Science is a rational formula.</p><p>With respect to my teacher misinforming me about Aristotle, that would, so to speak, to contrary to the rational formula of Aristotlian reality.</p><p>Megaric school denies the role of potentiality. Right now I am a student in class, but when I am home, I am no longer a student. I only am what I am doing. The megaric’s only allow for actuality. The problem with this is that it so to speak creates a staccato existence where you immediately appear and disappear.</p><p>“To be a builder is being able to build”, not necessarily currently building.</p><p>Megaric’s school undermines any notion of coming into being. This is a crucial conceptual misstep.</p><p>9.6</p><p>Actuality is full realization</p><p>A block of wood, qua statue of hermes, is potential. After it has been crafted into a statue of hermes, it is actual.</p><p>Motion is a form of incomplete actuality. Contemplation is complete actuality because the means and end coincide. Doing philosophy is an end in itself.</p><p>There isn’t an actual infinite.</p><p>You don’t diet for the sake of dieting. You diet for the sake of getting thin and in shape, which is external to the act of dieting.</p><p>God has no potentiality to be something he isn’t already.</p><p>Notes – December 1, 2010</p><p>10.4 – Contrary and contradictory play a central role in his view of the universe.</p><p>Grey isn’t the contrary of black or white. Black and White are the contraries of each other, they are the ends of this spectrum.</p><p>One thing in one genus is not comparable to another thing in another genus. Animality (genus) and Rocl-like substances (genus) can’t be compared, outside of saying that both are substances. One is ensouled and living matter, the other is inert and inanimate.</p><p>There is no middle term between ‘being’ and ‘not being’, therefore they are contradictory. Importantly, one of the two have to be true, unlike contraries, whereby you don’t have to be either black or white.</p><p>Aristotle is working out the metaphysics of not being. That is what the discussion of privation is about. Privation is about, in some sense, the state of non-being. If you are cold, then you are not hot. This is part of the coherent and proper account of the science of being, you also have to offer an equal account of non-being. And, if you can’t offer that, then your metaphysics is inadequate.</p><p>10.7 – In order to have a middle term, you have to be within the same genus.</p><p>10.10 - The imperishable things are by necessarily so, and also for perishable things. This demonstrates a rigid ontology, that they necessarily must be the way they are.</p><p>12.7 and 9 – the eternal things are the way they are by necessity</p><p>Mental realist, the intelligible structure of the universe is such that it has its own ontological structure.</p><p>Aporiai force us to articulate, as philosophical puzzles, the nature of potentiality and actuality, contrary and contradictory, etc. in order to do metaphysics.</p><p>Are there such things as separable substances, book zeta.</p><p>Metaphysics Book 12 (lambda, CH 7 and 9) –</p><p>Reading: Chapter 1, Book 1 – History of presocratics and Plato.
