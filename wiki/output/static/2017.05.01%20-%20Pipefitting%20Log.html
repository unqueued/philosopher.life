<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was kind of a letdown. </p><p>I drove my wife to work this morning. We had our usual argument about the nature of humanity. She still has faith in humanity, and I do not. Did this color my perception? Did I just pay more attention to it? Or is this coincidence? Or both? I told her I have faith in her, and even myself (even if only out of practical necessity we must take up that mantle of faith). I honestly believe we pursue the truth. It's why we change. I'm not convinced the probability of others changing is high enough to warrant faith in them. I feel justified in choosing to have faith in individuals, but I'm not required to (especially not by any rational standards I can find).</p><p>So, I walked into class and we sat around. We studied for a math exam. Chris thought it was a shame that we had to study for this and that people failed it (algebra and geometry). It is the kind of math that everyone should know. I just moved onto studying for the next exam on pipe threading. It was a joke. Chris and I talked about the plans for the class. It's clear that after buttwelds and this 2nd pipefitting book (the last book of the standard class), we'll actually be done. Effectively completing the extra pipefitting books as an elective isn't something our teacher really wants to do, although I will try to do it.</p><p>We were ready to take the exam immediately, but the teacher decided to give us the answers first and then to let us study until lunch (obviously unnecessary). He's purposely holding us back. I eventually just grabbed my computer to surf. Meanwhile, the guys started talking about politics. What were otherwise just normal stupid people became violently stupid people. They praised Trump. They adored his attitude and aggression. They really do see immigrants as their enemies. They despise gay people. They hated Obama without reason. They openly admitted they knew little to nothing about politics, but still felt justified in their opinions. </p><p>Look, we're thousands of miles away from my view of the world here. I can't expect these retarded kids to ever get anywhere close to where I'm at besides basic socialism (which they've been trained to hate from birth). I would interrogate them with the Socratic method, and it was obvious that they didn't give a shit. They were fundamentally anti-intellectual and proud of it. I could see from their glances and body language that I was failing their good ol' boy conservative shit test. Lol. I am disgusted by these human beings. </p><p>Look, I'm more than qualified to argue on the topic. But, there were so many things going wrong in their arguments that there was no way to distill it and walk them through it. It was a logistical nightmare. We couldn't evaluate or argue. Reason and facts didn't matter.</p><p>I can forgive much. Willed-ignorance I will not forgive, especially not habitual ignorance. Virtue is Knowledge.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> I'm more than willing to concede that they would never be as knowledgeable or as intelligent about these topics as I am.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> I do expect people to do their actual best. I know they can do better, wildly better. They don't and they won't. I will not accept it, although I will not articulate anything of the sort directly to them.</p><p>Luke and Chris are the only remotely sane individuals, and even they are dumb as fuck. It's disturbing. I know, I'm redpilled, and I believe people are evil. Loss of innocence, yadda yadda. Somehow I'm still blown away. I need to develop a game plan to deal with stupidity. Obviously, I cannot tip my hand anymore. </p><p>I'm dealing with human garbage here. I will respect them and be kind to them. I will seek rights for them that they surely haven't earned simply because I think it is demanded by the golden rule. I can forgive stupidity about most topics, but not broadly normative topics like politics. </p><p>I am fairly alone out here. It sucks. And, you know what, it's not my fault. I hate (in the sense of like, not love) people because they really are bad. A part of me mourns the end coming to swallow up our species. But, part of me is happy to see the Human Disease, as a species, die off.</p><p>Also, I'm so thankful we are homeschooling. Avoid the fucking trash. </p><p>Anyways, before the exam, the teacher had a guest come in to have him sign paperwork. This grown woman could barely use her computer. The illiteracy was annoying. The teacher had me come three times to help, and eventually, I just did it for her. </p><p>We took the exam. Simple. I also asked about the Precision Measurements and Torque seminars that are sometimes made available to pipefitting students. I know my teacher doesn't get along with these other teachers so well, but I would like to have the opportunity to learn these things. You never know when they'll come in handy. Apparently, getting the Torque technique down correctly will be very useful, particularly in professional pipefitting environments that require you to sign off on your work.</p><p>Afterward, I watched others for a bit. The teacher finally gave Luke, Mel (Keaton), and me an assignment. We were to take down the 2&quot; simulator screwpipe down and replace it with an identical socket weld fabrication. Eventually, Chris and Nash were assigned the 1&quot; (it appears they avoided rolling offsets entirely). Luckily for everyone, I kept my isometric drawings for each simulator fabrication. </p><p>I went ahead and measured mine out to make sure the drawing was accurate (because I somehow don't trust myself: I felt rusty today). Our teacher had to help us find flanges for this large pipe. We dug around and found 2 stainless steel socket weld flanges, but the third had to be a slip on. This made our takeouts abnormal. Also, I asked if we should put a valve on this. We found a socket weld flange for 2&quot; pipe, a very tall looking valve that I couldn't identify. </p><p>I did the math a couple times to make sure it was right. We had to add-on instead of take out for the valve. Noteworthy, while for fittings I can trust my book for the 1/8th of an inch heat expansion on my takeouts, when I calculate them by hand, I must remember to do this. I forgot the 1/8th of an inch for the socket weld flanges and the valve. It wasn't hard to adjust for it though. It's super important that we get the math right. I had to convince Luke of this, and I did it by showing the center-to-end measurement minus the complete takeout to the wall of the recess. It was off by 1/8th of an inch from our book. Then I explained how our other pieces required we do the same. Mel didn't give a shit. He's a retard by choice.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Hanlon, suck my dick.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span>  Pause for humility complaint; let's be clear, even I am deeply ignorant even though I strive not to be,</sub></p></div>
