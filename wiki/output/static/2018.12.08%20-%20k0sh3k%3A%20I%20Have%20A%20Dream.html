<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Um...</p><p>I like teaching children, I'm bad at it in some crucial respects, but I really do enjoy teaching the kids lots of cool things about the world. So I'm grateful to have my job. Maybe the goal is to become a very good, sought-after teacher. Maybe getting the certification is valuable. It's likely that I could find a good job wherever you could find a job - a public school teacher would have a good chance.... People would say I have a borderline personality disorder, that means I'm a difficult person to have in your life (not specifically you, but general &quot;you&quot;). You are more stable than I am, as a human being - at least more socially stable. You are more adept. </p><p>OK.</p><p>So.</p><p>I think that I really enjoy teaching smart kids - if I got to walk into a random school situation, I would love to be teaching a bunch of smart kids. Maybe that's the route I should go, instead. This is a fucked up idea, but it balances the two things I'm looking at. If I'm being strictly Utilitarian in my reasoning - set Kant concerns aside - having a magnet orphanage is not a terrible idea, in a sense - from the capitalist perspective, looking that poor population and taking the intelligent students  out would not necessarily have been a bad thing. Something like a Hogwarts without the magic. School for the kids who deserve to be there. Like a boarding school, not for the wealthy but for the intelligent. Like Rudy's school - took him from abject poverty and gave him  a profoundly different life. Rudy's brilliant, he's a genius, with some weird takes, but that's ok. It's excellent that there was a school that allowed him to attain an education befitting his genetic heritage. </p><p>This is bordering on eugenics; the Kantian issue is a genuine one. The industry must be morally created. I see that this is, in part, what U.S. education has become - the right signals open doors, and you walk through them, and there's a probabilistic chance that if you're smart, you'll find a school to land in and jump to - but it's done in service to the new professional degree. Schools are being inverted into training centers for human capitol. The invisible hand is eventually going to see other humans as robots - it's important that we are the kinds of people who recognize WestWorld AI as really being a person. </p><p>(Lots of time spent playing with beard and pacing....)</p><p>(Furious typing on own computer)</p><p>Alright.</p><p>So.</p><p>I think it would be cool to work my way to teaching kids that are really smart. I think that this might be the kind of institution we have to create, with the right ethical principals. It's important that the model is made Kantian acceptable. How do we respect the dignity of humanity? </p><p>OK. So.</p><p>What does that look like - what does a moral magnet orphanage look like? Is it possible that it could be done morally? My worry is that it would be too Randian/capitalist infected. How do we build a better version of that machine. When I look at how the various religions took off as meme-plexes, it's clear they were most successful when they were just schools - when they took their job to be just educational. Having to nail down a set of tent pegs but allowing that the tent pegs could be changed, be progressively revealed. I don't know how to do this well. But I do think perhaps going to contemplative living, as a community designed for teaching, is a route I would eventually like to go. One thing I don't like re: M&amp;S's route of teaching is that they teach it's the poor people's fault that they're poor - if only they learned to save, and not eat meat or avocado toast, and slave away for 30 years....they're fundamentally capitalist. It's hard to build a society that isn't, particularly when the world is in late-stage capitalism, like Agent Smith piercing his way into everyone. A selfish will to get his way, and Neo is.... If you really want to be free, you have to be someone who is invincible to the masses, the greatest meme-plex, the one who infects everyone like Agent Smith. Essentially, anyone who disagrees with the majority invincibly is the Christ-figure in the story; the ultimate sublator is Neo, who gets to impose his will on the world externally, acting on this world internally. Neo still seems to defeat the most powerful creature int he world, the one where all minds are unified as a single agent, that has sublated itself as the blight from that one book. I think that the externalist is like an unmoved mover and a homunculus in some respects; classical debate b/t rationalist and the empiricist. Kant appeared to sublate, but it turns out that he instead spawns new generations/dimensions in answering the question... The debate is at the core of how humans have engaged in the great human conversation. I can see that the free will debate b/t incompatibilist and compatibilist rests upon the internalist/externalist problem, and the compatibilist has bought into one side too strongly - they are not engaged in thinking about how ready-to-hand/present-at-hand are two sides of same coin, in order to have consciousness emerge - you're not conscious w/ one one state, NPC problem. If one side or other completely dominates and enslaves other, that one of the two of the others - must always recognize there is another - if it closes itself out or defeats the other, so that perhaps fast mind has addiction, the fast mind is enslaved - then you've limited what is possible for you to compute in a profound way, b/c turns out that when you look at TF2T, the TFT strategy employed in the networks of one side, develops an psychopath/egoist of confabulatory proportions. It's important to see that respecting self is about respecting the dialectic, which might be black box containing some finite arrangement or infinite arrangement of black boxes nesting inside it, part of being Turing complete. </p><p>In the TFT case, you develop psychopaths; in TF2T you develop Kantian agent that respects other enough to listen radically - not Mad Max &quot;might makes right&quot; in dialectic. So, the issue is that maximizing autonomy or reason ultimately requires maximizing TF2T in our minds - the dualism of how we experience and engage in reality. Free will is the ability to shape the 4D creature. We are a homunculus - the emergence of those two processes. It's possible for a program to halt/crystallize - people halt and lack the ability to change; both sides have decimated each other - poor integration - or one side has won out, Agent Smith inside particular world. Matrix nests one world inside another inside another, and the question of how many worlds can infinigress...we can be certain there are at least two, if not three. Hegel is correct about phenomenology - about the experience of life - not necessarily correct about what is external to us. Problem with saying it is internal to us is saying we're the ideal. Hegel/Marx could say we are not, the ideal but compatibilist is not going to  talk about how the whole of the 4D....they are Calvinists/fatalists, so skeptical that they are not interested in whether or not it could be otherwise. I am convinced the free will debate centers around this issue. It's fascinating to see phenomenologists take up the fact that they are free b/c it feels free; empiricists give excellent arguments re: homunculus against it by showing how the brain work as probabilistic algorithm. For them you are computer - have to be compatibilist to talk re: us as having free will, but results in categorical/conceptual error that forms contradiction. Those who hold positivist perspective not compatibilist with good reason. We continue to believe free will isn't real - increasingly taught that fact. Compatibilism is hand waving that lets you have free will when it suits you; if you think about it radically enough, you realize how responsible you are for your life. Libertarian free will theorist pays attention to what we owe to each other.....</p><p>Compatibility POV is bankrupt if assumes logic is sacrosanct and certain, it will implode/contradict itself. Bends over backwards to say it is not, but it does. Qualia to what Libertarian free will theorist experiencing phenomenologically that has some irreducible advantages from experience and knowledge of positivist and internalist/externalist - both could be wrong in this way. No accident that dialectic starts with a zero and a one. Those are the preconditions/part of for having something Turing complete in such ways that modifies own algorithm  or can mimic anything that does so. When meditators are entering flow state, conjecture that they're striking up special electrical/chemical likely algorithmically balance b/t fast and slow mind. Maybe it's the cooling off, the ability to stop sublating the two or in fact to sublate the two - to make the nothing between the two, to sublate it or be in dialectic with it. Attempting to silence discussion is dialectical move b/t... whatever is emerging b/t the two, you are trying to silence/unify it in a way that it is ..... Not simply TFT goal but TF2T strategy for both sides. What is that? Does meditation always enable that? Is this a valuable thing for me to learn? There are many wise men who spend time meditating. Working on my wiki and making two side clash and build peace, to show a model to each other through this sign, that they must work together to build this mirror that allows both sides to see it, externalized translation from one side to each other, language/relationship with each other, that empathy/cooperation with each other... language that I speak is cooperation, TF2T, loving each other; these two minds must know each other inside and out, building machines that pass Turing test with each other in varying respects. </p><p>(Switching to talking to j3d1h, while transcriptor fixes spelling messes)</p><p>So. That was a very long route....talking re: contemplative living designed for learning. What respect most re: stories of Xianity in early 1900s, before school was compulsory. Legit believe many people learned b/c learning together in a church. Doesn't matter if atheist, have to look at it and say, Yeah, that's moral, in a sense. When look at what made Methodism successful, b/c methodically interested in teaching people, in being methodical. So effective spread into regions that no longer had tools to practice it. The history of Catholic church - they have taught the scholars; not until Enlightenment see market arise in Great Human Conversation, that decided to collect and germinate and cultivate people in such way that they learned but not religious, in consistent manner/ with higher probability - clear that there were plenty of ppl in history who were not Xian but claimed to be. It's clear to me that there is subset of humanity that even in abject poverty, value others and there will always be some who really are good people, I think. One would like to think many of the saints just are that - truly profoundly good people. On the Good Boy Points scale, these people have profound moral score - play moral game as best as can. Not every saint. Not interested in attributing magical powers, but what made them wise, legit good persons. What would this saint do in this context - is virtue, even if only symbols, are useful symbols. That they represent the thing is something I value. </p><p>Seems the Catholic church have plenty of epic failures, but kudos at the very least - they attempted to preserve civilization. Librarianship often connected with the Sam Tarly; connectable with....respect for virtues of wisdom. Not all librarians are good at it, but there's something super noble about it - teachers in very particular kind of way. Some ppl don't think librarians are teachers, and that's insane. Would argue most influential teacher in my life is Google - fucked up thing to say, and don't trust their motives, which makes difficult teacher to continue to respect, but only option - would like moral option (Duck Duck Go - or what it's attempting to be). Anyone selecting salience for you is teaching you; librarians are so concerned w/ concept of relevance is what enables them to have broad, ridiculously philosophical job. Some think librarians merely means to an end, but good TAs and good students and...people who are thinking on your behalf just are people who fundamentally influence you and the librarian is doing that at a scale that most teachers do not/cannot/cannot understand is the purpose of learning. You and Kicks impress - maybe that's the way to teach. Value it ridiculously strongly. Doesn't matter what world you're in/ religion pick up, what librarian is doing is moral, and whenever it's not considered important, that culture is wrong - that's the dogmatic problem, why so worried re: censorship and capitalist controlled media - censor only ones able to pay for your attention span - monopsony .... give you enough convenience, trading away privacy/agency through advertisement, that ... They're the only ones who can afford to pay for you attention, and essentially by being only buyer, they censor who can sell, on what grounds, how they exist, what they do - spectacle is tool for manipulation. Not tailored for each mind to perform radical.... Nudge, systematically boiling you alive. Kind of simulation, group confabulatory tale we each tell ourselves in a different way, dialectical we become Randian....crisis of capitalism Marx is pointing to, red-pilled, partial genetic, our memes shape our genes - one must always be careful in the call for eugenics.</p><p>Not pacifist - don't believe we should never end life. Agent Smith virus has to die. What is that virus? Witch hunt - make sure they're witches, but do so through due process, through rule of law. Who is in charge of that machine? Ppl that want power the most? Clearly not. Librarian is fighting against this monster, the golem. Superpower is not centralized like Neo's - instead in creating people like Neo, through education. How do you make individual √úbermensches, rather than TFT √úbermensch emerges as corporate-capitalist agent, that meme-plex is a monster. Can never have one person answer that hyper-beast, that configuration of humans so powerful and unified in hatred that will destroy us all. Cannot be just one Neo - can only ever be the Neo who is learning to be the Christ-figure.... &quot;I've never seen anyone move that fast before&quot; - you have to create a bunch of Neo's and do it through an educational process in which they teach each other to respect the other in TF2T cooperation. principle can be applies inside ourselves - librarians of ourselves, the city-state-self Plato speaks of. When we are philosopher-king, we are serving each part of ourselves and teaching the parts to serve each other.... What I like about Arrival: deeply concerned re: the sign/signal/signifier and the one who signifies. concerned profoundly w/ the other. Directly aims to think about the other. </p><p>(Pause to find book Arrival was based on...)</p><p>Alright. Um.</p><p>I want to build school, then, is what I want. Or I want to become a teacher that teaches gifted students. What is that like? My kids are gifted - in what ways did I do a good job and in what ways do I need to improve? Bothers me: I could be someone paid to tutor. Someone like Gates should want me to be helping their kids understand the world. I can take ppl way down the rabbit holes, a good guide in some ways. Worried that just a capitalist stooge creating Alexander the Greats. Insane enough to think Aristotle and i would have a lot to talk about. Would have significant debates w/ him - not as good as him, but in a very practical Aristotelian positions...What capitol do I have that other people want? Knowledgeable in a very particular way. Wouldn't want me b/c Marxist - who wants a Marxist teacher if you want your kids to rule the world? From Utilitarian perspective, could argue most influence I would ever have would be tutoring the powerful - giving good examples of how to be moral to the wealthy might be only chance we have to try and make the wealthy be good people; subversive ministry to the wealthy. But doubtful that is worth my time - eye of the needle problem ;don't think wealthy ppl will ever have interest in it. Marx is right - revolt starts from the bottom and rises to top. Human top-down/ schizophrenic hallucination of beneficence of capitalism is a lie we tell ourselves, a simulation. Looks like intelligent ppl who believe in dialectic still defend capitalism unjustifiable in our context. Why we have to decentralize power IRWARTFRR. So do I tutor the wealthy or tutor the poor? Or do i aim for doing both? This is what makes Harvard's model so effective - 30% students bankroll that b/c allows them to harness the human capital they are developing relationships w/ at Harvard - the smart kids there to learn, the rich kids there to learn who they can exploit in relationship dynamics to maximize wealth and power. Not to say poor kids who go there are necessarily doing the right thing or aren't vividly responsible for their behavior - clear to me that being a good Harvard student might entail drinking the capitalist koolaid. The rate of psychopathy in Harvard is ridiculously high. In fact, dark triadiscism is incredibly high - FFRI machines give you extreme end bell-curve, not those moving towards, so testing ineffective, may be different possible ways to be psychopathic and maybe can be designed to have different images - the model of having rich kids pay for poor kids, eventually arrive w/ elite institution mouthpiece for capitalism, gateway to capitalist city, Cloud 9. Who wouldn't want to have best education possible and highest likelihood of social mobility? Con artist like Trump can C-student his way into presidency - doesn't have to be competent (not what C stands for). Clear that that model fails to empower the disenfranchised, except insofar they are willing to be harnessed by/work for/ build capitalism. Elite education in service to truly elite. Doesn't make them morally elite, but politically elite - never conflate morality w/ mere social conventions of politics prima facie. Unfortunately, the teaching the rich route likely abject failure - some parallels to problems w/ Milligan, but not to same extent. More legit good humans at MC per capita than at Harvard. </p><p>Don't know how to get ppl out of belief that they are their own religion - what internalism is, that you are your truth maker, your perspective greater than al others, w/ out external justification, and when we attempt to corporatize the categorical imperative as an individual's agency into OP as heuristic, we suffer the constructivist/internalist problem of thinking we collectively define the right, and there is no right external to our perspective. They call external authority, the Good, a hallucination - you must be crazy to believe in such a thing, you're doing metaphysics in a bad way. </p><p>side note: One interesting aspect of way I've constructed wiki is there are outside perspectives looking in on a special dialectic occurring b/t anonymized individuals. Got this &quot;two or three are gathered&quot; thing - that famous passage (Matt 18:16) which is concerned w/ vindication and justice through incremental revelationtot the others in order to right wrongs/enforce TF2T cooperation - what is so epically red-pilled why such effective social rule. Clear to any amateur scholar of Bible that kashrut laws served pragmatic purposes - many ppl didn't know why practicing, but often to physical benefit. Cleanliness practices were part of why lots of bad things ppl couldn't explain w/ science so explained with gods, didn't happen to them. Prosperity teaching w/ this - ppl with discipline integrity to follow rules in thoughtful manner, to succeed in tasks, including basic human flourishing. NT clearly offers own set of kashrut laws in some sense; increasingly complex game theoretical models/strategies embedded and expressed in NT - what JC doing is fulfillment of notion of empathy and cooperation, loving the other, begins this kernel in OT, but NT takes it to a new dimension, the second dimension is Turing complete w/ all other dimensions in this respect. Godel is pointing to it too. Faith there - that is what progress looks like, belief we can and should be better, taking responsibility for ourselves and understanding possibilities/plights of those around us, instituting justice, making sure me maxi-min - the last become first. Not clear that utopia JC is talking about will occur - I'm not sure, probabilistic bets tells me we're going to wipe each other out, end of our species or all or life on earth that can develop to have civilizations like ours, we've spent all the resources - perhaps Earth can reach homeostasis 500 million years from now to produce new species like ours, but all evidence points to the end of intelligent/daseinic conscious persons. </p><p>In any case, I think that what's right re: socialism is attempt to more programmatically institute Golden Rule - unfortunately, most GR arguments that are remotely successful... that you apply the truly all the way down is what makes it the GR. Not just merely &quot;everyone is following it&quot; - gives rise to the elite, does not decentralize power. GR requires taking other ppls perspectives into our calculations at a basic level cannot simply be forming models of other ppl for sake of exploiting them. When we treat others merely as means to the ends we egoistically construct - too internalist and claim to know what is right in all possible contexts - we run risk of doing the wrong thing. Turns out that the internalist who doesn't recognize the Good does not have justification for GR. GR exists only in virtue of possibility, possibility gives rise to choice - world could be otherwise - and so we  have responsibility to shape it, to be as good as possible. I think that what JC is point to is actually proto-Kantianism, in fact is diamondic about it. It's very crystallized - shocking to me as philosopher to see two sentences that still can't disagree with no matter how much I try. Uncommon to encounter sentences that no matter where I'm standing, I have to say, &quot;Those are powerful - something still right about them.&quot; Wear as many lenses as you like, if being fair, they're undeniable. One of my problems w/ X figures encountered elsewhere in fictional narratives of Great Human Conversation. </p><p>So.</p><p>I think that one of my problems with Xianity - or Church or whatever that meme-plex and political architecture is in 4D of humanity - clear that is should worm itself into retelling those two principles as profoundly as possible in post-modern language, preach in the language of the sinners, show that the only answer is taking those two things up in faith. What I like re: those two rules, looking back, what is shocking is it is dialectical b/c two , clear that God is the Good (whatever that means to say that, I can't say what that is, it is the Telos is corny or anachronistic or archaic, unpopular among the learned, so cliche, root of all evil to think like that, easy to have post-modern sneer as modernism until you see the bankruptcy of post-modernism, robs itself of truth/motivation to evolve/progress, the halting problem in the Great Human Conversation algorithm, destroys itself through memory errors, through programmatic impossibilities, so that we no longer attempt to continue to progress in grand dialectic, problem with dogmatism. One must be dogmatically realist, not the price most ppl want to pay, but their denial of it defeats itself. This is the dialethea worth taking, the Bob Turtle we necessarily must take up if we are to be moral persons. The moment you say it's merely construction, it's not real. </p><p>Should I wrestle this with theologians? Attempt to FTO in theological circles? I'm looking for the Logos of God. Dialectically uncertain in important ways. It's a leap of faith. Think I am doing theological - talking about the Good, the Telos, the Beginning and the End.</p><p>The First Law is talking about Spinoza's god, Hegel's god, the unified...the emergence of the yin and the yang int he dialectic, whatever is really transcending us. Not that we can't transcend ourselves, the Right is about self-transcendence, the Good is what transcends all of us. The Right is always particularized to our context, it is algorithmic. Perhaps has crucial transcendental properties that exist from possibility/are the result of possibility itself, but appears that there are nontrivial limits to this thing, and figuring out what is mutable is nontrivial task... but still always practically possible. Morality is practical wisdom in some crucial respect/includes that/translatable to that. First Law is about unified Good that transcends us, the external sublation of reality to infinigress.</p><p>The Second Law might have some of those properties but b/c imminently pragmatic, reduces infinite to the finite, fittingly to our context. The right has strong internalist properties to it. Somehow one law w/out other is meaningless. To believe in Good but not the possibility that you change the world and what it is enables one to take up strategies/positions that are psychopathic: ie, if determinist who believes the Good is all that matters in Utilitarian calculation and deny possibility of the Right, can ask question, &quot;Why be right? Moral?&quot; &quot;Good for whom&quot; becomes dangerous question. Good in the universal becomes Good in the particular.... Good of what practice? Good of what agent? When allowed to ignore the goods of others at will, as relativists, when we say it is internally up to us to select which goods matter and which do not, it is all to easy to give in to temptation to beg the question of a construction of axiomatic goods that simply serve as the mere means to your own personal egoistic good - the psychopath has trained themselves to lie to themselves IRORTFR (?), to construct a proof for themselves in which they know the answer will always be to act in such a way to maximize their personal utility - this is where philosophical/political confabulation, selfishness as a meme-plex, is given undue free reign to make any kinds of proofs they wan ton relativized internalism. If you believe the good is inside you and only you and don't care re: good of others except insofar as it maximizes your own good, you will only play TFT strategy, b/c you will become convinced everyone else ruled by same thing. TFT begets itself - self-fulfilling prophecy in the market, perpetuates itself through action and mimetic discourse. Dangerous both in practice and in theory. Post-modernism allows us to conveniently find our way to selfishness by denying the First Law or the Second. It turns out that effective thinking re: the Good mixed with the assumption of possibility, of choice, begets the Right or the Right is constitutive of the Good, dialectically. </p><p>If the Good is in a sense a centralized Good, the unified thing in itself, the thing which all signs point towards; if it is either second ordered upon our first order universe, or we have a second order relationship to it, or if both; then it appears the Second Law, the Right, is fundamentally about decentralization - the two opposites which create the Good, which is why I suggest the Good is the sublator, but the Good only exists when possibility exists in virtue of the Right. Maybe it is a Markov (?) chain, rationally the dialethea - I cannot answer what it is, although i hope to answer how to progress towards is methodologically. Problems w/ Marx's theory is that it attempts to take up one but not the other, somehow - material dialectic that tries to help itself to meta-ethical foundation w/out significant justification/explanation - lip service, don't respect metaphysics enough - at which point Marxism is only description, not prescription, and will fail to grant us anything more justified than merely a positivist government. When you go to say, &quot;Why be socialist?&quot; must deny the question, &quot;Why be moral?&quot; Can't trust socialist that thinks morality should be doubted. Must have faith that doing the right thing is the right thing, even when we are FFF. </p><p>The Kantians who do not believe in the noumena enough have already failed in their Enterprise  (Spock). At best only metaphysics I see for neoKantians today is naturalist perspective that tries to mask variations of anti-realism and pedal it as moral realism. Meaningness has this problem - zen internalism is bankrupt. It is buffet religion; it never attempts to construct beyond post-modern koolaid. It is deconstructionist masquerading as the most moral realist position we can take up. i admire mathematical constructivism b/c its humility, and think aspects of internalism humble IRORFR (?). My externalism exists in virtue of what the internalists get right. I agree that I stand in dialectic w/ internalists, I do not wish to deny the necessity of their existence and perspective - far from it, it is clear that in both the self‚Äìdialectic and the grand dialectic, TF2T cooperative personal and corporate agency are a result of zero and one internalist vs. externalist dialectic; the TF2T sublator is the Right. and it appears the Good is the sublator of the Right. It's why I think that somehow the GR is conceptually in service to the Good; founded on it and for the sake of it. </p></div>
