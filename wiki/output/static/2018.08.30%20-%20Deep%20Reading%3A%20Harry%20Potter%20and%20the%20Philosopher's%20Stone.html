<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The cloak is almost classic Ring of gyges, but the mirror is a kind of Ring of Gyges as well. Intention shines through. I'm very surprised that it would be made even remotely available to others kind of freely. I don't know why they didn't use it as a teaching tool. Hell, I don't know why it wasn't used for far more kinds of problem solving. Rowling introduces insanely powerful mechanics, but doesn't follow through on how it would modify the world. This always bothered me. I look at it now, I'm glad that she at least wields it. </p><p>This is the problem I run into in DND too. I break the game because I understand the limits of the constructions which arise from the mechanics. I wonder how going pure narrative will play. My goal isn't to ludologically win. I have no idea what I'm really doing in the story. What will my telos be? To help my children have a good time, of course!</p><p>As an avid stealth-mechanic player in many of my games, the cloak is lovely to me. It's such a powerful CC (which, I realize parts with the traditional conception of CC, but it is). ...I have mechanics on the brain this morning.</p><p>Dumbledore sometimes seems to see through everything. It's never explained besides &quot;he's really powerful.&quot; Lol. Harry Potter really is an exploration of power, but not systematically so.</p><p>The tribalism is normalized. I guess I don't mind so much, as long as the lines are drawn on moral grounds (which isn't to say Rowling succeeds at all on this front).</p><p>Why the philosopher's stone is not pursued more radically is annoying to me... Look at our world today, even guaranteeing 10 more years of life would be something you could charge almost any amount for.</p><p>I'm curious (but not enough to search) to know when Rowling knew Snape would be redeemed.</p><p>I do love how bad people get away with it in the short term. That good wins out in the end makes it a child's story.</p><p>The relationship between the powers/magic of the Centaurs, humans, and all the other species is an interesting one. </p><p>Rowling did the classic, perilous forest justice.</p><p>The high stakes testing is not something I appreciated well enough. But, frankly, I had an atrocious education. I'm lucky I can read, lol.</p><p>The focus on animals in this universe is wonderful. I can't say I'm a huge animal person; I prefer to enjoy them from a distance, with the exception of my cats.</p><p>Ron's chess prowess doesn't make much sense.</p><p>How did he know what earwax tasted like? I've licked my wife's ears plenty, but I have strong doubts I would know from a piece of candy.</p><p>Points, as always are forced. The fix is in. Also, I think the quidditch vs real danger/problems point assessment makes no sense at all. Keep your sportsball to yourself, please.</p><p>Alright, this sounds terrible, but I hope I never read this book again. Glad I did, and I think it's time. Battlestar Galactica had the same problem, yo.</p></div>
