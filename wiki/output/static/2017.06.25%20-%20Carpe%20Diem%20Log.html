I surfed while people trickled down. </li><li>I watched a bit of league too!</li><li>After everyone left, I took my DCK and watched Rick and Morty until it started to hit. </li><li>I was already set up to meditate in my room. That's what I did. <ul><li>It was hard work, and I'm glad I did it.</li></ul></li><li>The family arrived before my meditation ended.</li><li>My son showed me what he and his sister had made in Sunday school. It was cute and interesting. He put on a show.</li><li>I came downstairs and finished my DCK writing. </li><li>My daughter started her schoolwork, and my son went out to play (since he had finished his). </li><li>I set up power and ethernet cords around the house.</li><li>I tried calling the Landlord (corporate HQ really), but nobody answered. I'll try again tomorrow.</li><li>We went shopping for groceries. It went by quickly, and it was fun.</li><li>We put groceries away. My son came back to help us. <ul><li>We've been giving him more roaming freedom.</li><li>He now marks on the chalkboard where he is in addition to telling us.</li></ul></li><li>We made chili and cornbread for later in the evening.</li><li>I made the sexy times with mi amor.<ul><li>I am surprised that I can achieve it through the DCK afterglow now.</li><li>It is possible the effects are weakening on me. In any case, things seem to be working.</li></ul></li><li>My wife and I talked. We planned our DND game.</li><li>I planned and wrote about it. Everyone had a blast building characters.<ul><li>The kids were excited to the point of being rude actually.</li></ul></li><li>We had our family meeting while we ate.</li><li>I chatted briefly with my friend ALM.</li><li>I'm writing this, getting some water, and gonna watch some Rick and Morty while I try to fall asleep. <ul><li>DCK's ability to prevent me from sleeping is still there.</li><li>I will assume it is harder for DCK to disassociate me now. I believe I am more integrated than I was.</li></ul></li></ul></div>
