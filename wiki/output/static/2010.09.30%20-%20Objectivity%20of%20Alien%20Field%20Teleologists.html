<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Okrent introduces a novel thought experiment of the alien field teleologist observing Earth who objectively distinguishes meaningful intention from what is meaningless accident and happenstance.1 He believes this exemplifies the sort of thinking process a teleologically-primitive (pragmatic) view of the mind must employ to objectively observe and empirically understand intentionality and determine which objects are intentional and which aren’t.</p><p>This is a potent thought experiment (in my view) because it reduces the variables of a physicalist’s consideration of intentionality to something quite primal, objective and third person; physicalists are forced to only allow for the deduction of the ontological reality of ‘goals’ and purpose without the entanglements (or presumptions) of the usual sort, such as the contextual bias and background information that we bring to the table in our consideration of intentionality. The thought experiment appears to point towards a strict form of objectivity when discovering and defining intentionality, and I admire this.</p><p>What I considered most profound was how this thought experiment points out some very serious flaws in naturalistic accounts (more narrow than just a teleological account, as property dualism can theoretically do just this) of intentionality, and arguably, I think the thought experiment may detract from (rather than support) Okrent’s conclusions. I think Okrent’s thought experiment demonstrates the need for an objective stage upon which the physicalist can describe intentionality, but I don’t believe it will arrive at meaningful, goal-directedness or any sort of intentionality with normativity.</p><p>Regarding the naturalistic account, this thought experiment involves a number of complex issues. How should one define the ontological status of normative claims and objects? Do normative-based intentions (the only sort of intentions in the eyes of Okrent) possess a similar ‘realness’ as a rock or tree in a naturalistic world? Surely these normative properties aren’t subjective (subjective normativity is simply the denial of normativity in my view), but actually grounded in some ontological mechanism (which isn’t necessarily a physical one) which makes meaning and value a very real thing. Are some aspects of normative intentions both non-physical and real? If so, can we really say that a belief in normativity is compatible with naturalism or physicalism? Would we not say of any sort of naturalistic empiricism deducing metaphysical objects (such as normativity) that we’re being objectively led away from naturalism? If normative intentions are metaphysical (rather than physical) objects (at least in part) with relevant ontological status, aren’t we outright forced to deny naturalism?</p><p>In my view, a proper physicalist’s implementation of this thought experiment will demonstrate objectivity in some unorthodox and generally unconsidered ways. For example, for us to be objective, like the effectively alien physicalist, we must shed our own bias for carbon-based life forms and those animals which are like us – we must not appeal to our own mental experience and processes of sensing the world and project these properties upon other things. We are likely even limited in what we are objectively allowed to say about ourselves in this manner.</p><p>If you can imagine the sorts of aliens in science fiction which sense the world differently, they may not even believe we are ‘life’ initially (just as we would perhaps mistakenly assume the alien isn’t ‘life’ as well). From this very objective view, how is the alien field physicalist in a position to sort through the objects on earth? In my view, the objective physicalist’s measurement of intentionality, as demonstrated by this thought experiment, boils down to observing patterns in the statistical natures of bodies in motion, appeals to complexity and system theories, and perhaps measurements of entropy. There must be a physical formula (or perhaps many) which describes intentionality.</p><p>Okrent denies reductionism, and he may have the popular opinion in doing so. I disagree with him though, and I think the objective physicalist should be reductionist in this fashion. While I agree we have no current account of how one science can be reduced to another, this is strictly different saying it isn’t possible to do so. I only need to posit the theoretical (not the feasible) reductionist claim to maintain that the physicalist really must provide a formulaic account of intentionality.</p><p>In the exploration of earth, the objective physicalist will observe some unique, extremely complex, compact objects, but I see no reason to think the objective physicalist will deduce them to be especially ‘meaningful’ objects or different from rocks and elements, except for complexity. These objects do as they must. They all are a part of mathematical equation, and unique occurrences of complexity will necessarily arise within the turbulent formula. We need not be surprised that these complex things arise; we should not claim they are special. They are simply necessary. Essentially, complexity isn’t enough to justify metaethical value or meaning. To the objective physicalist, these objects are statistical occurrences in nature, nothing more. Any appearance of ‘value-based’ specialness is an illusion (and frankly, not objective from a purely physicalist perspective).</p><p>Further, some may be inclined to invoke ‘whole is greater than the sum of its parts’, but the thought experiment puts a serious dent in the physicalist’s account of intentionality as this ‘value-added’ beyond the sum isn’t physical, it is metaphysical.</p><p>It is my view that a naturalistic/physicalist account of intentionality must analyze physics without the presupposition of ‘value’ and ‘meaning’ and then deductively and objectively discover the existence of ‘value’ and ‘meaning’ in physical terms. And by ‘value’ and ‘meaning’ I think we are talking about metaphysical properties of objects. Importantly, we would be concluding something quite non-physical as the result of a naturalistic/physicalist account.</p><p>Frankly, I am very skeptical that a truly objective physicalist can provide empirical evidence for intentionality, ‘goals’, or ‘meaning’. As Okrent admits, intentional ‘aboutness’, ‘goals’, ‘being for something’, and ‘purpose’ is founded on normativity and ethical evaluation (I agree). I don’t see how an objective physicalist can posit intentionality or normativity. Normativity isn’t a physical science, it is a metaphysical one.</p><p>Naturalistic accounts of intentionality (which maintain compatibilist illusions of meaning and normativity) are innately subjective accounts. We are imposing our bias of ‘specialness’ and assumptions of value on true physical empiricism.</p><p>By granting equivalent ontological status to metaphysical normativity (as one would to the physical realm), Okrent could make sensible claims about how physical and teleological explanations of intentionality will lead us to understanding the metaphysical descriptions of the normativity of intentionality. If he granted some variant of dualism, he could still take teleology to be primitive, and still arrive at the normativity of intentionality.</p><p>1 Mark Okrent.
