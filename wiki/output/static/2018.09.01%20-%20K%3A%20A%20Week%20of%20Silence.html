 Wonderful. I‚Äôm still thinking about your list too. Emoji image of 'thinking_face'
5 hours ago
 How are you today?
5 hours ago
 Oh, yeah, lol. What you thinking about that list?
5 hours ago
 what classes are looking like your favorites, and why?
5 hours ago
 I want to make sure I give you a diverse range of music and not just things I like.
5 hours ago
 I‚Äôm loving Eastern Mysticism. I think it‚Äôs a class you would really enjoy too.
5 hours ago
 I'm doing well, monthly wiki audit and responding to a number of folks, my Find The Others axiom has exploded.
5 hours ago
 Thinking about thought and different kinds of thought as well as abstract ways to perceive the world. It‚Äôs wonderful.
5 hours ago
 Fantastic! Sounds like life is as busy as ever. Haha
5 hours ago
 Yeah, I was looking through your books. I'm lucky enough to live next door to an expert, so I get to talk about it with him as well.
5 hours ago
 I'm happy with whatever you give me, even if they are just what you like. I think it's interesting you will try to add things you might not like, lol.
5 hours ago
 No one has ever done that for me.
5 hours ago
 What is your strategy and reasoning for it?
5 hours ago
 Next time we meet up we‚Äôll definitely have to talk more about it. 


I‚Äôm thinking about music that has touched my heart, or shaped my tastes into what they are today. There‚Äôs a lot in between that I‚Äôve enjoyed but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it‚Äôs the best of the best.
5 hours ago
 Ah. I take it this project is going to take quite a bit of time then, eh?
5 hours ago
 Unfortunately yeah. Emoji image of 'sweat_smile'
5 hours ago
 I don‚Äôt wanna half ass it
5 hours ago
 I know that feeling, lol.
5 hours ago
 well, if you feel like just doing it piecemeal, sending a song when the occasion arises, that's also fine. It is a cool project, of couse. =)
5 hours ago
 In that case, start with To Zanarkand by Nobuo Uematsu. It‚Äôs one of the main themes of Final Fantasy X which I also happen to be replaying right now. It‚Äôs truly a work of art.

 De nada. How are [[k0sh3k]] and the kids?
5 hours ago
 [[k0sh3k]] is starting the second year of her confirmation class teaching cert, drove to Knoxville today for it. Will see her sister. She's been busy with the new school year. This time she has built curriculum and testing to train and figure out who should be doing the work which requires trust.
5 hours ago
 Kids are doing well. We read The Hobbit and are doing the LOTR now.
5 hours ago
 [[1uxb0x]] bought his own laptop to replace his dead one. He's been working on it.
5 hours ago
 [[j3d1h]] took my archived snapshots and wrote a complex set of scripts that would emulate a date as an environmental variable as it iterated through each daily snapshot for git commits (retroactively submitting commits), since we started the git processes about a year after I started taking snapshots. She then cloned these to multiple gits, accounts for everyone, and fixed my nightly snapshot script for everyone.

 How about your family? Your brothers enjoying school with you?</code></pre><p>Gotta admit, I think he's avoiding a conversation here? The &quot;Next time we meet up we‚Äôll definitely have to talk more about it&quot; sounds like a gentle misdirection? Almost no responses to me at the end. Ever the paranoia: it feels fake =(. </p><p>I'll make whatever relationship I can with him.</p></div>
