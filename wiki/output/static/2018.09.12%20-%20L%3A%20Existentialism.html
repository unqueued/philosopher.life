2 hours ago
 They’re an interesting bunch... very argumentative when all together, but when you get them on their own they are far more agreeable.
2 hours ago
 They sound like engineers
2 hours ago
 It’s interesting to me to see how differently they behave as a group versus one on one.
2 hours ago
 aye
2 hours ago
 do you feel the same in your interactions?
2 hours ago
 how many other female engineer friends do you have?
2 hours ago
 Not many, truthfully.
2 hours ago
 One I have is very introverted and keeps to herself for the most part. When she does open up though she’s got a fiery personality. Interesting dynamic.
2 hours ago
 The other is SUPER outgoing and always traveling/doing new things.
2 hours ago
 Both of them are very genuine people though, which I appreciate.
2 hours ago
 what makes a person genuine to you?
2 hours ago
 I can’t say I’m particularly close with either of them though. I do consider them friends, but they don’t often open up to me. It’s something I’ve grown used to.
2 hours ago
 A desire for honesty and the willingness to reciprocate it.
2 hours ago
 When I ask them how they feel on a subject, they give me the honest answer even if it’s not always “nice”.
2 hours ago
 And they don’t shut me down when I give my honest answer either. It’s a mutual respect.
2 hours ago
 an evil person can be quite genuine on your definition then?
2 hours ago
 Certainly.
2 hours ago
 It reminds me of the &quot;Authenticity&quot; paradigm of autonomy.
2 hours ago
 How so?
2 hours ago
 I was just about to ask your opinion on what I said. Tell me things \o/
2 hours ago
 I'm not entirely sure what I think about it. Obviously, I appreciate radical honesty and T42T cooperation too.
2 hours ago
 I think it's important to &quot;be ourselves&quot; in many cases, although it's clear that not everyone has a moral right to be who they are to varying dok (probably all of us).
2 hours ago
 What I appreciate about the notion of genuineness you've offered is that socializing is not a mere game, not simulation of one...it's two people literally trying to connect, possibly empathize, and it doesn't seem as prone to be the abuse of treating others as mere means through deceptive communications.
2 hours ago
 The &quot;keepin' it real&quot; authenticity seems often necessary but insufficient for autonomy that matters.
2 hours ago
 part of the problem in the honesty issue is that I can communicate things which are true, but they aren't actually the most salient pieces of information to me or to you (if you had known what I knew)
2 hours ago
 honesty is complex here because it requires a special kind of motivation to defeat the problems I associate with deception through omission
2 hours ago
 I have a similar worry about the undefined nature of &quot;reciprocation&quot; here.
2 hours ago
 It's fascinating to watch you &quot;walk&quot; through my messages on your screen through receipts.
2 hours ago
 Hehehe
2 hours ago
 I know my definitions tend to be loose. It’s always interesting to talk to you about things such as this, actually, because it forces me to do so and reconsider.
2 hours ago
 I feel like the conversations we have even briefly go WAY more in-depth than many of the ones I have with friends closer to my age. They often seem unwilling to have the nitty gritty conversations... it’s frustrating.
2 hours ago
 I know that frustration!
2 hours ago
 That’s not to say they WON’T have them or give me their honest opinion, it just takes a lot to get it out of them.
2 hours ago
 That's part of my Find The Others goal to some extent.
2 hours ago
 But the conversations I have with you and [[JRE]] get to the heart of the issue pretty quickly. It can be jarring, but very helpful.
2 hours ago
 perhaps there's a spiral of silence kind of element to it
2 hours ago
 I despise smalltalk.
2 hours ago
 lolol
2 hours ago
 But [[h0p3]], don’t you want to hear about the weather up in Louisville?
2 hours ago
 even when I meet strangers, my goal is to break the ice hard and fast. I want to know who they really are.
2 hours ago
 Lol =)
2 hours ago
 If it matters to you, yes. =)
2 hours ago
 https://philosopher.life/#Party%20Videos:%5B%5BParty%20Videos%5D%5D
2 hours ago
 Meh, sometimes it does.
2 hours ago
 Not usually.
2 hours ago
 Aye. Really bad weather is usually something that matters the most to me.
2 hours ago
 Sometimes I feel like an old man in how I discuss, aiming for the heart of the matter. The &quot;Jarring&quot; thing.
2 hours ago
 I can’t get your link to open rn... I’ll have to do it in a bit.
2 hours ago
 Lol... it’s something I miss in people these days though
2 hours ago
 Very rarely do you find people around my age who will ask you good, deep questions to stimulate conversation.
2 hours ago
 Admittedly, that's people in general.
2 hours ago
 IT’S SO ANNOYING
2 hours ago
 I think most people live invalid, simulated lives.
2 hours ago
 WHY
2 hours ago
 It's very painful to pursue the truth.
2 hours ago
 It requires sacrifices, including shedding parts of our identity.
2 hours ago
 Perhaps. Maybe that’s why I’m always so frustrated with my friend Anessa...
2 hours ago
 True that. Definitely wrestling with some real things rn, but you already know about them.
2 hours ago
 What's frustrating about Anessa?
2 hours ago
 She lives a very shallow, boring life. For as much as she enjoys anime and manga, she has a very two dimensional life. It’s getting better now that she has found a wider community of people through cosplay, but for awhile there she was very stagnant.
2 hours ago
 I have a hyperreading assignment for you.
2 hours ago
 It was frustrating to watch because it became very hard to get her to try new things, meet new people, or have discussions about nitty-gritty stuff.
2 hours ago
 Yeah? :o
2 hours ago
 You want some good Christian reading; research Kierkegaard. In particular, you will want to consider his existential modes/stages: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.
2 hours ago
 I cannot say he has everything right. But, the notion he presents has something obviously correct about it.
2 hours ago
 It is a crucial lens through which I interpret myself, others, and the world around me.
2 hours ago
 [[k0sh3k]] will kick herself for not having included Kierkegaard on her list.
2 hours ago
 (she may have, I do not know)
2 hours ago
 Anessa doesn't like change.
2 hours ago
 I bet it depends on the topic for the nitty-gritty. If you talk about the particulars of something she adores (Manga), she probably has a great deal to say. Unless you mean something specifically existential by &quot;nitty-gritty&quot; here, and that makes more sense.
2 hours ago
 More existential
2 hours ago
 Yes, she will talk a great deal about her interests. She does NOT enjoy talking about the harsh realities of life unless confronted by them in other ways.
2 hours ago
 Like a pet dying or someone treating someone else a certain way.
2 hours ago
 escapism
2 hours ago
 I know that drug.,
2 hours ago
 It's hard to be honest about what matters most.
2 hours ago
 Yeah...
2 hours ago
 I realized the other day that I have a very different approach to death than most. I know we’ve talked about it before, but it’s the most obvious thing I’ve noticed.
2 hours ago
 I’m not totally sure why or where I got it from.
2 hours ago
 But I think it makes a lot of people uncomfortable.
2 hours ago
 wait, I don't remember!
2 hours ago
 hehe
2 hours ago
 Please remind me, what is your approach to death?
2 hours ago
 I’ve observed that I tend to handle death better than most people. Rather than viewing it with dread and morbid anticipation, I see it merely as an experience we all share as mortal beings.
2 hours ago
 Yes it can be VERY poorly timed and even sad... but it’s not as soul-crushing to me as it is to a lot of people.
2 hours ago
 I have not experienced death enough in my life to know. Grandma was probably the closest person to me to have died.
2 hours ago
 Perhaps that’s why?
2 hours ago
 And, part of me was happy to see her pain just end.
2 hours ago
 Very true.
2 hours ago
 I take it back.
2 hours ago
 I have seen death before.
2 hours ago
 Hm?
2 hours ago
 In Thailand. A family thrown from their motorcycle. A child's brains on the ground.
2 hours ago
 Death is a fact of life, but I can't say I'm comfortable with it.
2 hours ago
 Yikes. Not pleasant I would imagine.
2 hours ago
 horrifying
2 hours ago
 I think it helps that I have influences in my life that talk about it in a positive way?
2 hours ago
 You know, most people do not face their own deaths until they hit their 40's and 50's.
2 hours ago
 Everyone knows they are going to die, but they don't fully know it.
2 hours ago
 There is something correct about the trope of the YOLO youth who feel invincible.
2 hours ago
 There’s obviously the Christian belief side of that, but I also follow a creator on YouTube whose channel is called “Ask A Mortician”
2 hours ago
 I agree that death is part of what gives our lives meaning. I agree it's part of the circle of life.
2 hours ago
 Yeah.. perhaps I am still too blinded by my own youth to fully appreciate it.
2 hours ago
 I see [[k0sh3k]] wrestling with this in her own faith.
2 hours ago
 Yeah?
2 hours ago
 I can't speak for her here, but to my understanding, she has let go of her belief in heaven and hell.
1 hour ago
 It's very clear from the New Testament that a focus on the afterlife completely misses the point.
1 hour ago
 knows not the hour or day
1 hour ago
 etc.
1 hour ago
 Right.
1 hour ago
 It’s not about waiting for what is to come but living out what should be here and now
1 hour ago
 Or perhaps more about that...
1 hour ago
 yup, making heaven on Earth, bringing the Kingdom of God here, building the Body of Christ now
1 hour ago
 Which we are just doing a fantastic job of these days. /s
1 hour ago
 ha
1 hour ago
 I do not know if and when the existential whirlwind ends, of even if it should.
1 hour ago
 or*
1 hour ago
 I think it’s important to take pauses from it
1 hour ago
 Hell, I’ve been doing that a lot lately myself. Have been distracting myself from the harsh realities of how I feel by diving head-first into the bazillions of D&amp;D things that I have going on. (Working on your all’s stuff in the background too, when I get the chance.)
1 hour ago
 I had a rough conversation last night with [[K]] about how it seems to be “the only thing I talk about lately” and I told him it was because if I started talking about else in my head I’d start crying.
1 hour ago
 =( I'm sorry
1 hour ago
 I needed the reminder though. Can’t escape it, have to face it.
1 hour ago
 I'd give you a hug if I were next to you.
1 hour ago
 I appreciate the sympathy. But I am not lost to my sorrows just yet.
1 hour ago
 Talking with you, [[JRE]], and [[K]] has helped ground me and remind myself that I can’t just sit around and let life blow by me even if it hurts.
1 hour ago
 The problem is defining the correct decision procedure for taking pauses from it. There's a slippery slope where we can confabulate our way into justifying not actually spending much time in that place. I don't know how to draw those lines wisely enough (only the wise can define wisdom, unfortunately). I know you aren't out of control, but still...it looks painful.
1 hour ago
 Anessa would be very comfortable in this conversation!
1 hour ago
 Even if it hurts to change I mean.
1 hour ago
 If by comfortable you mean she would hate every second of it, I agree. XD
1 hour ago
 Okay my phone is being weird and not sending/receiving right away so apologies if I seem to fall behind.
1 hour ago
 I've noticed some bugginess in Signal (despite plenty of polish). That would be my guess.
1 hour ago
 Maybe.
1 hour ago
 Either way, the older I get the more I realize life becomes exponentially more difficult than they ever warn you about as a child lol
1 hour ago
 Lol
1 hour ago
 True that.
1 hour ago
 I need to make my way to the bookstore/library for all these things you and [[k0sh3k]] are telling me to read.
1 hour ago
 https://gen.lib.rus.ec/
1 hour ago
 I asked you to hyperread. Just go research on the interwebs.
1 hour ago
 You should build your own library.
1 hour ago
 I would very much like to give you an invite to myanonamouse too
1 hour ago
 You'd have to seed to maintain your account.
1 hour ago
 But, I think you would find it extremely valuable.
1 hour ago
 That is one thing which I'm very lucky to have: access.
1 hour ago
 I have it with profound immediacy. I want to read a book, I have it 30 seconds later.
1 hour ago
 Truth.
1 hour ago
 A very hard thing to come by sometimes.
1 hour ago
 I’ll have to open this on my PC at home because my phone is like “hell naw”
1 hour ago
 plus, having a library wife who does ILL for living means I have access to hardcopies of anything I can't pirate too.
1 hour ago
 sorry, lol
1 hour ago
 No worries!
1 hour ago
 what is your phone doing? I'm curious.
1 hour ago
 It’s telling me the connection isn’t strong enough to open the webpage.
1 hour ago
 Which is believable because I’m having trouble sending/receiving today.
1 hour ago
 I think once I step outside the reception hell-hole that is my office building it’ll straighten out
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 Sidenote: I think my musical tastes have been “tainted” heavily by video games. I listen to official soundtracks more than modern music by a long shot xD
1 hour ago
 Ha
1 hour ago
 I have noticed something like that. [[K]]'s recommendation was also a game soundtrack.
1 hour ago
 He and I have been diving head-first into them.
1 hour ago
 I think it's difficult to peel apart what parts of the music take us back into our past experiences with it from the universal appeal of the music.
1 hour ago
 The D&amp;D influence doesn’t help either.
1 hour ago
 For example, there are particular songs which are burned into me from grinding in Everquest, playing Tribes 2, and Diablo 2...
1 hour ago
 We like to build atmosphere in-game with music so I’ve been creating an extensive list of atmospheric pieces.
1 hour ago
 just listening to the song transports me back
1 hour ago
 I'd be interested to see how you organize it.
1 hour ago
 It’s part of why I love music, honestly.
1 hour ago
 It's a problem I keep running into
1 hour ago
 Hahaha
1 hour ago
 It’s a google doc, first off.
1 hour ago
 Because then [[K]] can easily access t.
1 hour ago
 well, there are other ways to make it so he can easily access it* =)
1 hour ago
 True, but he prefers this method.
1 hour ago
 If you’re interested: SNIP!
1 hour ago
 It’s a long document. Sorry in advance.
1 hour ago
 LOTS of links.
1 hour ago
 I would know this was your work if I stumbled across it randomly in public
1 hour ago
 Yeah?
1 hour ago
 Are there [[L]]-isms all over it?
1 hour ago
 [[K]]isms too, imho
1 hour ago
 Dealing with Different Kinds of Players is funny
1 hour ago
 I will once again recommend Kierkegaard.
1 hour ago
 It has been SO helpful to view my players this way.
1 hour ago
 Or think about them in this way perhaps?
1 hour ago
 pigeon-holing models help
1 hour ago
 It means when we disagree I think about their way of thinking and try to address it. Sometimes disagreements are simply a misunderstanding of descriptors or overlooking a minor detail.
1 hour ago
 It reminds me of the ethics of engaging in dialectics.
1 hour ago
 Games are rhetorical dialectics.
1 hour ago
 I love thinking about how different characters in my favorite shows would slot into these models.
1 hour ago
 if they were playing DnD
1 hour ago
 It gives me as a DM perspective into what my players want
1 hour ago
 Which pigeon-holes do you and [[K]] tend to fall into?
1 hour ago
 And helps me craft a game they are more likely to enjoy
1 hour ago
 I appreciate that. =)
1 hour ago
 I am most likely an Actor, and [[K]] a Story-Teller
1 hour ago
 I am a mix of Actor/Storyteller perhaps.
1 hour ago
 I enjoy the roleplaying aspect (as I’m sure you’ve realized lately) and don’t mind making risky decisions for the sake of story.
1 hour ago
 I also view invincible characters and frustrating. If I do something dumb, let me die.
1 hour ago
 you said the magic words
1 hour ago
 &quot;for the sake of&quot;
1 hour ago
 Hehe
1 hour ago
 As* frustrating not and
1 hour ago
 I imagine you are likely a Power Gamer or something very close to it
1 hour ago
 what is the objective &quot;for the sake of&quot; DnD?
1 hour ago
 I'm a power gamer who finds have the game is trying to understand why to play the game.
1 hour ago
 half*
1 hour ago
 I'm trying to not be a power gamer, but I don't know which role to play.
1 hour ago
 In a sense, the pigeon-holes are metaroles.
1 hour ago
 the game reifies something about who we are...how we play the game defines us
1 hour ago
 Hmmm... the objective of D&amp;D...
1 hour ago
 I think lots of people play D&amp;D for different reasons, so it’s hard to say.
1 hour ago
 But I appreciate that it provides a space for us to think through a different person’s eyes, feel what they feel, etc.
1 hour ago
 But that’s the roleplaying/storyteller in me.
1 hour ago
 I could probably write a whole paper on the reasons why I find D&amp;D useful... but idk if it would totally answer your question.
1 hour ago
 It's okay. I do not think my question can be answered by us.
1 hour ago
 We can only get closer.
1 hour ago
 Hehe.
1 hour ago
 I do know it and similar games are valuable though. And I hope they last.</code></pre></div>
