<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Job is a book abundant with explanations for the suffering of Job. Job had four friends (not very kind either) that attempted to demystify why Job was suffering.</p><p>Job’s first friend, Eliphaz, seems to say that because Job is guilty of sin, he may undermine his religious freedom to complain about suffering. Eliphaz goes on to explain Job’s “guilt” when he says, “Your mouth condemns you, not I, your lips testify against you” (Job 15:6). Obviously Eliphaz holds that Job is corrupted with sin and has no right to complain about his deserved suffering. Eliphaz interesting explains that a spirit told him, “’Can mankind be just before G-d? Can a man be pure before his Maker? He puts no trust even in His servants; And against his angels He charges error” (Job 4:17-18). Is Eliphaz also explaining that humanity is condemned to be evil before it starts? It sounds as if mankind is bound to do wrong, but that we still cannot complain about the consequences of doing evil. This argument is not an adequate justification for the problem of suffering because it does not explain why we are simply ‘bound’ to do the wrong and how we still can be held accountable for evil.</p><p>Bildad is another of Job’s “friends.” Bildad says that Job is to blame for his own suffering. Bildad explains, “’If you would seek G-d and implore the compassion of the Alimghty, If you are pure and upright, Sure now He would rouse Himself for you” (Job 8:5-6). G-d protects and restores the righteous. Bildad believes that evil and suffering doesn’t happen in the righteous person. G-d seems to reward the faithful, and allow suffering as just to fall upon those who are not righteous. This argument greatly falls short of properly addressing the problem of suffering because we seem to find righteous people that still suffer, which is quite contradictory to his claim.</p><p>Job’s third friend, Zophar, is just as unencouraging as the others. Zophar says, “For you have said, ‘My teaching is pure, and I am innocent in your eyes.’ ‘But would that G-d might speak, and open his lips against you, and show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom has two sides. Know then that G-d forgets a part of your iniquity” (Job 11:4-6). Zophar seems to say that Job is getting off easy. Is Zophar pointing out that G-d is merciful even to the wicked, that not all sins are justified through suffering, and that maybe Job has it much better than he deserves? Zophar goes on to explain, “This is the wicked man’s portion from G-d, Even the heritage decreed to him by G-d” (Job 20:29). Zophar believes that Job has been fated this lot of suffering. Given that G-d would not fate us a lot of suffering and evil, Zophar’s claim seems to attempt to redefine both G-d’s and our purposes.</p><p>Elihu is a different breed than Job’s other three friends, possibly because he is younger. Elihu says, “Let his flesh become fresher than in youth, Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor; Then he will pray to G-d, and He will accept him, That he may see His face with joy, And He may restore His righteousness to man” (Job 33:25-26). Elihu holds that suffering is G-d’s form of education that changes the sinner into a righteous person. Suffering is a means to the righteousness for mankind. Interestingly, Elihu says, “’Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, For G-d is greater than man.’ ‘Why do you complain against Him, That He does not give an account of all His doing’” (Job 33:9-13)? Elihu alludes to the idea of a transcendent G-d, a G-d that needs not explain why things are the way they are. Elihu has the most interesting of the four claims. Ironically, he seems to know that G-d allows suffering as a device to educate the evil into righteous, yet we somehow cannot know this because G-d is transcendent. The argument from transcendence is from first appearance a cop-out, and suffering as an education-device is inadequate when it seems that G-d simply could program our environment to teach us in other, non-suffering ways.</p><p>Luckily for Job, he doesn’t need to rely solely on his friends’ advice; Job has a dialogue with G-d. G-d answers Job in terms of transcendence. Who is Job to question G-d? G-d explains, “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth” (Job 38:4)? G-d can do as He wills because He wills only that which is perfectly good. Imposing suffering at particular moments seems to be a necessary aspect of what a perfectly good being does. No doubt, we are left in awe at G-d’s answer. Who are we to so boldly answer these questions, when only a perfect being such as G-d may know them?</p></div>
