5 hours ago
 I am trying to save money for Thailand trip.
5 hours ago
 It's hard to explain.
5 hours ago
 I'm sorry about the plumbing =/
5 hours ago
 that gets expensive fast, from what I understand
5 hours ago
 So I am here by myself at a Thai restaurant. To feel the Thai smell.
5 hours ago
 lol
5 hours ago
 What funny?
5 hours ago
 That is sad. I'm sorry.
5 hours ago
 Sometimes sad things are so sad they become absurd.
5 hours ago
 I didn't mean to offend you. Sorry.
5 hours ago
 No no, why is it funny? I really want to Know.
5 hours ago
 I know it's absurd.
5 hours ago
 I did try so hard to not come to this Thai restaurant often because I don't want to spend too much money. But now I just have to come.
5 hours ago
 I can see that. I'm sorry that you suffering. I can feel it.
5 hours ago
 I wish you guys were closer so we can share the food.
5 hours ago
 I tried to look at the good side that we had money to fix it.
5 hours ago
 hell yeah
5 hours ago
 You must be quite frustrated. =/
5 hours ago
 I owe you an explanation about the absurdist humor, about handling farce and darkness. I have a lot of sadness in my life (I spend a great deal of my time studying what is wrong with the world), and sometimes the only way I can maintain my sanity is to laugh at it. Sometimes evil and suffering become almost meaningless because I can't make rational sense of it.

5 hours ago
 This will help.
5 hours ago
 
5 hours ago
 I am glad you enjoy that dish. It is not for me!

 I'm ridiculously picky about my noodles
5 hours ago
 I think my autism makes me hypersensitive to certain textures.
5 hours ago
 You are having a feast though, lol.

 What texture?
5 hours ago
 I do not wish to disturb your meal. I'm hard to gross out.
5 hours ago
 slimeyness of noodles is too much for me to handle
5 hours ago
 Hahaha
5 hours ago
 I find several asian cuisines accept a level a slime that I can't; though I aim to be grateful and would never show my disgust when served it
5 hours ago
 I cook my noodles Al dente.
5 hours ago
 Uncooked
5 hours ago
 lol
5 hours ago
 How are your kids doing? I've not heard word from either of you for quite a while about them.
5 hours ago
 What's Melissa been reading?
5 hours ago
 How's Sarah's gifted program going?
5 hours ago
 Have they been using [[ALM]]'s older computer?
5 hours ago
 Well they're doing great for school. When ever they go to after care with me all the teachers say they are such a good kid but when they get home I guess they just want to be themselves.
5 hours ago
 lol
5 hours ago
 I know that feel.
5 hours ago
 Hahaha

 My brother said something pretty similar to me recently about his foster son.

5 hours ago

5 hours ago
 Oh
