<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I saw a video a while back about it. I thought it would be worth checking out. I won't be be doing any summary repo work on it.</p><p>I am reminded how one can have a reasonable mile-high level model without having a models with justify and explain it (both below and above it).</p><p>Cute little claim that bankers are mini-unmoved-movers in the way they create money from thin air (at least initially) in their computing systems.</p><p>I really wish this book existed when I was a kid. It would have saved me a great deal of time and heartache.</p><p>I am reminded of the fact that people who defend capitalism collapse is/ought. Because the world is this way is the reason why it should be that way, etc. But, in reality, contingent truths, possible worlds, the nature of possibility itself just &quot;is,&quot; that is to say, possibility is part of describing our state of affairs. Thus, there is a descriptive nature to prescription, but they are separable.</p><p>I'm pleased to see the Redpilled notion of money and political power being inseparable on a large number of fronts. Money is just a facet, a window, and method of power. He does a solid job of explaining the necessity of politicized money, of the inability to fully privatize any major problems. I think we're in set theoretic territory here.</p><p>I think the author does a poor job of explaining the altruism/cooperation issue. He isn't an amazing philosopher though, and this is a very tough problem in metaethics.</p><p>I'm so pleased to hear him claim: &quot;democratize everything.&quot; He's right that we can't commodify everything because ultimately &quot;value&quot; must come from something outside the market itself.</p><p>We cannot allow wealth to count as having more &quot;votes&quot; in politics. Money must be silenced at the root of our political process.</p><p>He uses Nozick's Experience Machine argument throughout the book! Constant references to my favorite movie, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Matrix.html">The Matrix</a>, is going to win you point in my book. I adore it.</p><p>I love how he is telling us to become philosophers, to have earned the right to trust ourselves as authorities, to participate as informed citizens in democratic decentralization of power.</p></div>
