We‚Äôll talk about it, and hopefully you‚Äôll understand it better. You may find that reading the second time, you‚Äôll understand even more about it. Sometimes it will be by studying other related topics that you‚Äôll gain insight into your original topic as well. I‚Äôve read some of these passages more times than I can count. Certain things stand out more than others each time.</p><p>Metaethics</p><p>Meta-Ethics is the subfield of moral philosophy that focuses on questions and issues concerning the ultimate status or nature of morality (objectivism vs. subjectivism), moral motivation, etc.</p><p>In short, it deals with metaphysical and epistemological issues concerning morality.</p><p>Moral realist vs. Anti-realist</p><p>Moral realism is the claim that at least one substantive moral proposition is true.</p><p>Is morality something that exists independently of human minds but which it discovers through reason, science, revelation, etc.?</p><p>Or is morality a human invention that is dependent on human beings in some way?</p><p>Is morality objective and universal or subjective and relative?</p><p>Are there moral truths and obligations that are universally binding on all human beings or only moral values particular to individuals, social groups, cultures, etc.?</p><p>Is morality universal or relative?</p><p>When you make a moral evaluation (express a judgment that X is morally right, wrong or permissible, good or bad, virtuous, vicious, etc.), what do you take yourself to be doing?</p><p>Expressing a personal opinion, preference or attitude that cannot be objectively true.</p><p>Expressing a cultural norm.</p><p>Expressing a truth-apt claim that can be objectively true and not merely an expression of a personal preference, attitude, etc.</p><p>The Problem of Objectivity in Ethics:</p><p>1. ‚ÄúThe Earth is a sphere.‚Äù</p><p>2. ‚ÄúLying is wrong.‚Äù</p><p>If #2 is objectively true it does not appear to be not objectively true in the same way that #1 is objectively true (i.e. empirical verification).</p><p>Does the fact that moral judgments cannot be empirically verified mean that moral judgments cannot be objectively true?</p><p>Moral Realism</p><p>Ethical Naturalism</p><p>Ethical Non-Naturalism</p><p>Theological voluntarism, divine command theory</p><p>All of these theories contend that there is at least one objective, universal, and necessary moral truth.</p><p>Moral Anti-Realism</p><p>Ethical Subjectivism</p><p>Ethical Relativism</p><p>Non-Cognitivism</p><p>Moral skepticism</p><p>Moral nihilism</p><p>Error theory</p><p>Immoralism</p><p>All of these views reject moral realism and claim that morality is dependent on the individual, culture, etc. (which are subjective/relative, particular, and contingent).</p><p>What is Good and Bad?</p><p>Flower example. ‚ÄúGood of‚Äù‚Ä¶Good in itself? Etc.</p><p>What is Right and Wrong?</p><p>What is Happiness?</p><p>How are these concepts related?</p><p>What are the foundations of morality?</p><p>Agency, Freewill, etc.</p><p>Is it objective, socially constructed?</p><p>Why should I be moral?</p><p>Metaethics and Normative ethics is what we‚Äôll cover today. Applied ethics the next.</p><p>Morality and Happiness: Plato, Republic</p><p>Socrates, Plato‚Äôs mentor, is famous for saying: Knowledge is Wisdom.</p><p>The only reason people do bad things is because they don‚Äôt know any better. If they knew how to act, they would do better. There isn‚Äôt much space for freewill here.</p><p>The Good</p><p>1st class: Harmless pleasures with no consequences</p><p>2nd class: Instrumental+Intrinsic goods, like sight and health, and knowledge</p><p>Intrinsic vs Instrumental Good</p><p>You want health for its own sake, but it also brings about other goods. It is an instrument, as well, basically.</p><p>3rd class: Sacrificial Instrumental goods, like sacrificing our pleasure in doing it for some other good.</p><p>Justice</p><p>Justice is a codeword for being moral here.</p><p>Which of these 3 is justice?</p><p>Origins</p><p>Law exists to protect goods, prevent evils.</p><p>Justice is something we are forced to do, but don‚Äôt really want to do. It isn‚Äôt in our self-interest directly.</p><p>It is in our interest to be just from appearances on the outside, else we‚Äôll get in trouble with other people. But, the ‚Äúbest interests‚Äù here is based on social coercion and compulsion, not on what you really want to do. It isn‚Äôt good in an of itself, at least some might argue.</p><p>Ring of Gyges</p><p>Put on the ring, more than invisible. You can do whatever you want without the consequences you don‚Äôt like (but, you can get the consequences you do want).</p><p>It‚Äôs a ring that lets you get away with injustices, if you so choose.</p><p>Traffic light, small town, 3am.</p><p>People who appear just may put on the ring and become unjust people, since they were only being just because it was necessary to appear just.</p><p>Universal voice of mankind, the real speaker of this piece:</p><p>A really just person who put the ring on wouldn‚Äôt have any change in their behavior. They wouldn‚Äôt go out and do unjust things.</p><p>Ethical Virtue: Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics</p><p>Questions:</p><p>What ought we do?...Virtue is about ‚ÄúWho ought we be?‚Äù</p><p>Virtuous and vicious agents</p><p>Virtue ethics is hard to pin down. Some are anti-realists, some realists. There is a wide variety. It is the oldest of the tripod: Virtue, Deontology, and Consequentialism.</p><p>What do we really want?</p><p>To be happy</p><p>Eudaimonia</p><p>Teleology: ends</p><p>Our flourishing rests upon fulfilling our function.</p><p>Thinking things. Thinking in the right ways.</p><p>Our function gives us the capacity to be moral agents. To habituate virtue.</p><p>Virtue</p><p>Necessary, but not sufficient condition for Eudaimonia</p><p>Ar√™te, Excellence</p><p>Disposition</p><p>Not solely intellectual.</p><p>Desires, intuitions, beliefs,</p><p>Aristotle claims they aren‚Äôt feelings</p><p>Modern virtue ethicists disagree with this.</p><p>Aristotle is unclear on this point, but I part of the reason Aristotle doesn‚Äôt want to think of feelings as being moral may be because we don‚Äôt have control of them. But, we don‚Äôt seem to have control over our dispositions either.</p><p>Picking out salient features</p><p>Blink, Book. Forgery example. Virtuous (virtue of the practice) Art historians just have a feeling when something is a forgery, even without being able to articulate why.</p><p>Not a decision procedure</p><p>Doesn‚Äôt give you an algorithm for determining what is right ro wrong.</p><p>You can ask the Virtuous agent though.</p><p>They will give you certain reasons, even if they aren‚Äôt the reasons which make sense to vicious agents like us or reasons we‚Äôd like for decision procedures.</p><p>Cultivation/Habituation</p><p>Virtuous dispositions are based on patterns of actions</p><p>Like an excellent musician, being a good person requires training, practice, etc.</p><p>Training from childhood. If you weren‚Äôt born into the right setting, you just can‚Äôt be virtuous, and you can‚Äôt really be happy either.</p><p>The mean</p><p>A mean of virtue between two extremes of viciousness</p><p>Excess and deficiency</p><p>The Virtues</p><p>Cowardice ‚Äì Courage ‚Äì Recklessness</p><p>Insensitivity ‚Äì Self-Control ‚Äì Self-Indulgence</p><p>Stinginess ‚Äì Generosity ‚Äì Extravagance</p><p>Extreme Humility ‚Äì Truthfulness ‚Äì Boastful</p><p>Shamelessness ‚Äì Modesty ‚Äì Prudishness</p><p>Laziness ‚Äì Self-motivation ‚Äì Ambitiousness</p><p>Apathy ‚Äì Gentleness ‚Äì Quick-tempered</p><p>Boorishness ‚Äì Wit ‚Äì Buffonery</p><p>Doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, etc.</p><p>Salience</p><p>Vicious agents should overshoot the mean, toward being vicious on the other side. Their vicious natures will draw them back toward the mean.</p><p>What ought we do when Virtue seems to not make us happy?</p><p>Luck</p><p>Difference between maximal Eudaimonia and what is practically available to us. Why be moral? Aristotle doesn‚Äôt answer well enough. He seems to think it is part of our function, but it seems like happiness is disconnected from our function of thinking in some ways.</p><p>I can verify for you that thinking does not make you happy, although it may be necessary for virtue.</p><p>Common Criticisms of Virtue Ethics:</p><p>No clear normative guide for dealing with moral cases, problems.</p><p>Criticisms of teleological views of human nature.</p><p>Situationist objection undermines the notion that human beings have stable character traits as presupposed by Aristotle‚Äôs version of virtue ethics.</p><p>Utility and Common-sense Morality: Sidgwick, Methods of Ethics</p><p>Teleological</p><p>Consequentialism: the view that moral theories should stress the results of actions; invariably associated with utilitarianism.</p><p>According to utilitarianism, the aim of morality is to maximize utility.</p><p>Maximizing utility: bringing about the greatest sum utility or pleasure in the world.</p><p>For what time frame?</p><p>For whom?</p><p>How do you measure utility?</p><p>Epistemology problems</p><p>What counts as Utility?</p><p>Distinguishing Higher &amp; Lower Pleasures:</p><p>Better to be a Sad Socrates than a Happy Pig</p><p>The calculus, lookup table</p><p>Is it subjective? Or, how does subjectivity play a role?</p><p>Act utilitarianism vs Rule utilitarianism</p><p>Act utility:</p><p>an act is morally right if and only if it produces at least as much happiness as any other act that the person could perform at that time</p><p>Rule utility:</p><p>an action is right if and only if it conforms to a rule that leads to the greatest sum happiness</p><p>Act utility is too particularistic, too complex. No human could possibly go through with it.</p><p>Rule utility is easier. We can follow rules.</p><p>Self calculated or Globally calculated</p><p>Expect/predict problem</p><p>Railroad example</p><p>Common Criticisms of Consequentialism:‚ÄØ</p><p>Deontological objections (intentions, some actions are inherently wrong)</p><p>Predicting consequences</p><p>Calculating happiness</p><p>Robert Nozick‚Äôs ‚Äúutility monster‚Äù</p><p>&quot;Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters who get enormously greater sums of utility from any sacrifice of others than these others lose . . . the theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed in the monster‚Äôs maw, in order to increase total utility.&quot;</p><p>Bernard Williams‚Äô Jim in South America:</p><p>‚ÄúJim finds himself in the central square of a small S. American town. Tied up against the wall are a row of 20 Indians, most terrified, a few defiant, in front of them several armed men in uniform. [. . .] However, since Jim is an honoured visitor from another land, the captain is happy to offer him a guest‚Äôs privilege of killing one of the Indians himself. If Jim accepts, then as a special mark of the occasion, the other Indians will be let off. Of course, if Jim refuses, then there is no special occasion, and Pedro here will do what he was about to do when Jim arrived, and kill them all. [No plausible way of escaping the choice.] The men against the wall, and the other villagers understand the situation, and are obviously begging him to accept. What should he do?‚Äù</p><p>Harris‚Äô Survival Lottery:</p><p>‚ÄúY and Z put forward the following scheme: they proposes that everyone be given a sort of lottery number. Whenever doctors have two or more dying patients [who did not bring their misfortunes on themselves] who could be saved by transplants, and no suitable organs have come to hand through ‚Äònatural‚Äô deaths, they can ask central computer to supply a suitable donor. The computer will then pick the number of a suitable donor at random and he will be killed so that the lives of two or more others will be saved. [. . .] With the refined of transplants procedures, such a scheme could offer the chance of saving large numbers of lives that are now lost. Indeed, even taking into account the loss of the lives of donors, the numbers of ultimately deaths each your might be dramatically reduced, so much so that everyone‚Äôs chance of living to a ripe old age might be increased . . .‚Äù</p><p>Duty and Reason as the Ultimate Principle: Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals</p><p>Deontology ‚Äì duty science</p><p>Generally concerned with respecting persons</p><p>Mere Means vs Ends in themselves</p><p>On Kant‚Äôs view, one of the central components of ethics is to respect other people‚Äôs autonomy or their ability to give themselves the moral law (i.e. moral maturity).</p><p>On Kant‚Äôs view, so long as people reasoned rather than simply emote about morality, then we will ‚Äì by using our own ability to reason using universal categories ‚Äì arrive at the same basic conclusion about what is morally obligatory, etc</p><p>Uncompromising. Deep look into metaethics, groundwork of ethics.</p><p>Dr. Sensen said he had a sore neck today because he spent so much time ‚ÄòNodding‚Äô his head while reading Kant this morning.</p><p>Universality</p><p>What distinguishes morality from other areas is that it is unconditionally binding.</p><p>Not making exceptions for yourself ‚Äì that is part of the universality.</p><p>Action = Act + Intention</p><p>Reason is specially defined.</p><p>It recognizes its goal as the good will.</p><p>Whenever you have a good will, you are reasonable. You aren‚Äôt being rational otherwise.</p><p>Persons, by definition, for Kant, have reason.</p><p>Kant redefines who we really are to get where he‚Äôs going. The authentic, autonomous self is very key to understanding him.</p><p>An intention is the aim, plan, or purpose of an action. Intentions demonstrate the ‚Äúfor the sake of which‚Äù of an action. While actions can fail or succeed, intentions don‚Äôt admit of failure or success in the same way. An intention seems to be an expression of our motivations. Ultimately, an intention is the result of a choice concerning what one will pursue and why, and it is obviously a significant, practical aspect of moral philosophy.</p><p>In standard forms of utilitarianism, intentions are morally irrelevant, as only the results of action have any value. In virtue theories, intentions are morally relevant to some extent, as they are crucial to the psychology of the virtuous agent.</p><p>Kant begins the Groundwork by priming our intuitions about the nature of the good will. He says only a good will is good and nothing else is absolutely good without limitation. In contrast to the good will, other mental talents, inclinations, and psychological characteristics can be desirable (even encouraging the good will), being contingently and circumstantially good, but they aren‚Äôt necessarily and always good because they can be used for evil and by an evil will. Even actions have conditional moral value. Only a good will is necessarily, unconditionally, and always good.</p><p>A good will is not good because it causes some other end, rather it is an end in itself. Even a will which isn‚Äôt efficacious is still good, shining by itself like a jewel. This is a key consideration for answering our question concerning the moral relevance of intentions in Kant‚Äôs theory. Note that whether or not action bears the sort of fruit we expected, as sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, a good will underlying that action remains unblemished and just as morally potent and worthy. In contrast to utilitarianism (a theory which Kant seems to have anticipated), Kant‚Äôs theory is far less concerned with consequences of actions, and far more concerned with the will which expresses action. In this light, good intentions seem to have similar characteristics to the good will, and thus intentions seem morally relevant in Kant‚Äôs theory.</p><p>We come to realize that the good will is unconditionally valuable because it is determined by reason and the moral law. Obviously, action need not be determined by reason or the moral law. We may act from our inclinations, our instincts, and other sentiments. Actions, unlike the good will, are suspect. To be clear, I am not saying that actions cannot be valuable or have merit. Actions certainly can have moral worth according to Kant‚Äôs theory, but only under certain conditions. Our duty, which springs from the moral law, is essential to understanding the relationship between good will and action.</p><p>We must act from, not merely in accordance with, duty. An action has moral worth only when it is selected by the moral law and executed out of respect for the moral law. The intentions behind our actions matter. If we intend to do action X for the sake of desire satisfaction or mere happiness, then that action lacks moral worth. In contrast, if we intend to do action X solely for the sake of the moral law, then our action has moral worth. The intentions behind our actions are the essential ingredient to determining the good of the action. Kant provides some famous examples of which elucidate the relationship between duty, intention, and action.</p><p>The honest shopkeeper acts in accordance with and in no way contrary to his duty to serve people honestly. Yet, he is motivated by self-interest, acting not from duty, but from merely prudential reasons. His action may be right because it conforms with his duty, but it is not good action because it is not done from his duty.</p><p>The suicidal man who wants to die ‚Äúyet preserves his life without loving it, not from inclination or fear but from duty‚Äù has a maxim with moral content. The man had a duty to preserve his life, and despite his inclinations contrary to his duty, the man acted from duty alone, and thus he performed an action of moral worth.</p><p>Likewise, the sad philanthropist who has no emotion of sympathy for others and yet is beneficent from duty alone is to be praised. His action has ‚Äúgenuine moral worth.‚Äù To be beneficent from inclination, which is merely in accordance with but not from duty, lacks moral worth. This makes sense, as surely the sad philanthropist cannot be held directly responsible for his emotions, but he can be held responsible for rational choice and acting from duty.</p><p>Pathological love, like other inclinations, cannot be commanded. We cannot be held responsible for inclinations, although we are held responsible for acting from inclinations. Practical love, in contrast to pathological love, can be commanded. Acting from duty can be commanded, and we can be held responsible for this. Our intention is morally relevant to action. An action has merit solely in virtue of being performed out of respect for the moral law.</p><p>Kant‚Äôs examples, such as that of the sad philanthropist, sit in stark contrast to the virtue ethicist‚Äôs assessment. Having the right sort of inclinations and emotions are central to being virtuous, and yet, as Kant points out, it is only the rational choice to act from duty alone which has any moral relevance. Intentions are morally significant, but the sorts of intentions which Kant‚Äôs theory demands of us are very different from the sorts demanded by virtue theories.</p><p>Intentions and universal moral law seem to be at the heart of Kant‚Äôs theory, in contrast to action and consequences as found at the heart of consequentialist theories or character and inclination as found at the heart of virtue theories. If the purpose, aim, or goal of an act is to follow the moral law, acting from duty, only then is that action a good action. So, while the moral law supplies us with the content of what is right and wrong, our intentions seem to be necessary conditions for achieving anything of moral worth. Intentions are clearly morally relevant in Kant‚Äôs theory of ethics.</p><p>‚ÄúAn action done from duty has its moral worth, not in the purpose to be attained by it, but in the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúDuty is the necessity to act out of reverence for the law‚Äù</p><p>Categorical Imperative</p><p>A Maxim Testing Decision procedure</p><p>Maxim</p><p>Maxims are subjective principles, only hold for an individual‚Äôs will, but are not laws, as laws are universal and hold for the will of all rational people</p><p>Structure: [act, principle, purpose]</p><p>E.g. [kill himself, self-love, ‚Ä¶.?]</p><p>The Maxim contradicts itself, and thus fails to pass the CI test.</p><p>Should be apodictically clear to Reason.</p><p>Maybe I‚Äôm not reasonable enough.</p><p>Those maxims which we can universalize are moral laws as the result of the CI.</p><p>3 Formulations</p><p>Universal Law of Nature:</p><p>‚Äúact only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law‚Äù</p><p>Humanity Formula:</p><p>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.</p><p>Kingdom of Ends:</p><p>‚ÄúSo act as if you were through your maxims a law-making member of a kingdom of ends‚Äù</p><p>Perfect Duty (obligation) and Imperfect Duty (permissibility)</p><p>CI Machine‚Ä¶.</p><p>[Maxim-1, maxim-2, Maxim-3] -&gt; [CI] -&gt; [Maxim-1] Passes ‚Äì Perfect duty</p><p>[Maxim-1, maxim-2, Maxim-3] -&gt; [CI] -&gt; [Maxim-1, Maxim-2] ‚Äì Imperfect duty</p><p>Objections:</p><p>Consequentialist objections: Axe murderer and lying.</p><p>Might be a Deontic objection too: Particularizing maxims problem</p><p>Deontology appears to prohibit acts (because it would involve violating rights as understood from a deontological perspective) that would maximize overall well being. For example, it prohibits using one person as a means even if doing so would protect many more people from being treated as means.</p><p>How do we resolve conflicts between competing duties?</p><p>Rational Choice and Fairness: Rawls, A Theory of Justice</p><p>Editor of the anthology puts this squarely in the moral field. That is not the standard view. I happen to agree with the editor about Rawls to some extent though.</p><p>Again, we might go back to Plato‚Äôs mixing of Justice and Morality</p><p>Rawls is trying to help us think about ‚Äújustice as fairness‚Äù and find answers in a fair and objective manner.</p><p>He offers a powerful social contractarian heuristic device for determining the principles of justice</p><p>The ‚Äúbasic structure‚Äù of society, as described by Rawls, is constituted by formal, legal, political and economic institutions.</p><p>How best to configure the basic structure is central to justice, in Rawls‚Äô view, because it fixes the distribution of goods, services, opportunities, authorities, and rights. The basic structure is the initial subject of justice.</p><p>It is here (either for the creation of a basic structure or as an assessment of one) that one can begin to question and formulate the principles of justice which normatively define the various possible configurations of the basic structure.</p><p>Principles of justice design, specify, assess and justify the blueprints, arrangement and practices of these institutions and the overall basic structure.</p><p>Rawls is famous for this device which formulates the principles of justice, a device he calls the ‚Äúoriginal position.‚Äù</p><p>The original position is a type of thought experiment, an abstraction, a hypothetical instance of drawing up a social contract among members of society, and a method of thinking about justice.</p><p>The parties within the original position are meant to agree upon whatever counts as the fair and correct principles of justice used to generate the basic structure to which they would find themselves subject outside of the original position.</p><p>The original position structures intuitions we have about justice and how we formulate them ‚Äì the original position is designed to provide an impartial justice, and render a stable society.</p><p>Notably, the concern for impartiality and fairness is what leads us to the most profound and potent fixture in the original position, what Rawls calls the ‚Äúveil of ignorance.‚Äù</p><p>Agents in the original position find themselves ‚Äòbehind‚Äô a veil of ignorance.</p><p>While behind this veil, ‚Äúno one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities.‚Äù</p><p>Agents are deprived of the knowledge of their personal particularities, what societies they come from, and their histories.</p><p>Some of the attributes which count as morally arbitrary in Rawls‚Äô eyes might be considered controversial (e.g. your religious beliefs), but let us pass this by.</p><p>The essential point, to which I think we can all intuitively agree, is that differences which are arbitrary from the moral point of view don‚Äôt count with regards as to how the principles of justice treat you.</p><p>Agents behind the veil must be detached from their actual, particular circumstances when formulating the principles of justice.</p><p>Proper justice requires we answer a hypothetical question: If you couldn't know who you were, what would you choose? This makes a lot of sense - it removes bias.</p><p>Thus, the principles of justice which are produced from within the original position and behind the veil of ignorance are in some sense impartial and unbiased.</p><p>What then constitutes these agents, these amorphous creatures which have shed morally arbitrary features?</p><p>Rawls believes these agents have a sense of justice, being willing to comply with what is required by justice.</p><p>They are also free and equal agents.</p><p>Vitally, agents behind the veil are rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizers.</p><p>These characteristics provide the motivation and mindset of agents formulating the principles of justice.</p><p>They have the necessary tools and knowledge to formulate the correct principles of justice, to know what is normatively just and fair about different configurations of basic structures given their rational, mutually disinterested, utility-maximizing characters.</p><p>While ignorant of particularities, agents are extremely knowledgeable about generalities. They have a commanding knowledge of general facts about human nature, psychology, sociology, political science, biology, and economics.</p><p>Obviously, hypothetical</p><p>Thus, with this knowledge, from behind the veil of ignorance, agents are able to rationally construct and agree to the principles of justice, even agreeing with principles which might not benefit them as the individuals they are outside of the original position.</p><p>Rawls is very thorough, and despite the hypothetical nature of the original position, he is also practical. He invents an apt regression test procedure used to make sure we actually agreed to the correct principles of justice. He calls this the ‚Äúreflective equilibrium.‚Äù</p><p>Employing the reflective equilibrium allows agents to go back and forth between the original position and reality. This method allows us to continually justify and revise (if necessary) the principles of justice.</p><p>Interestingly, it just so happens that Rawls thinks he knows exactly which principles of justice would be chosen from within the original position. They essentially are:</p><p>1. The Principle of Greatest Equal Liberty</p><p>People are to be as free as possible.</p><p>2. The Difference Principle</p><p>Social and economic advantages should be distributed in order to maximize the shares of the most disadvantaged, those on the bottom line. Maximize the minimum.</p><p>First off, these principles are lexically ordered in priority.</p><p>The first principle is the most important one, and the second merits consideration after maximally satisfying the first.</p><p>Intuitively, it seems that there might be many possible basic structures which equally maximize the first principle, and the second principle does the work of assigning further normative value, effectively acting as a tie-breaker to the subset of initially acceptable basic structures generated by the first.</p><p>The first principle of justice is concerned with maximizing basic rights and liberties for all citizens, including political liberties, freedom of speech, freedom of association, religious liberty, etc.</p><p>The second principle is about maximizing the wealth, material goods, and services for the lowest margins of society.</p><p>For many liberal intuitions, the first principle is the least controversial. The principle of greatest equal liberty seems a very plausible product of rational utility-maximizers in the original position, particularly given classic utilitarian views on liberty.</p><p>There seems to be an acceptable and ostensible story which we can tell, about how rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizing agents in the original position, as defined by Rawls, would create and agree upon the first principle.</p><p>The second principle is a particular brand of distributive justice theory, including why we should believe (as Rawls believes) that utility-maximizing agents in the original position would choose this particular principle of distributive justice.</p><p>This, perhaps, is more controversial.</p><p>Rational utility-maximization isn‚Äôt so clearly linked to the difference principle.</p><p>Part of this story seems to be missing. In order to see why, let‚Äôs dig a bit deeper into the ramifications of the difference principle, going through an example of it as a decision procedure.</p><p>Consider the following monetary table and the explanation of it which follows:</p><p>The table represents a hypothetical choice. Agents in the original position need to make an algorithmic, procedurally-based choice between the three possible, yet different distributions of wealth.</p><p>Let us assume that each option equally satisfies the principle of greatest equal liberty; it is then up to the difference principle to decide which type of distributive structure is normatively best.</p><p>There is only one type of unit to be distributed, in this case money; let‚Äôs arbitrarily say thousands of Euros annually per person.</p><p>Quartiles represent a fourth of the population, and people in each quartile make the specific annual salary determined by the respective distributive economy.</p><p>Note that the totals are different, which is to be expected, as different economic structures have different sum total outcomes.</p><p>What would the agents in the original position choose? Everyone is behind the veil of ignorance; they don‚Äôt know which option will bring greatest benefit to them individually, outside of the veil.</p><p>Agents behind the veil are in a game of limited information.</p><p>They need a strategic formula to determine which distribution is best, particularly because they lack the knowledge of which particular quartile they will find themselves in, when outside the original position.</p><p>According to Rawls, the difference principle is the formula they would choose to apply, as it alone offers us the correct decision procedure and just distributive outcome. What does it actually do in this case?</p><p>Well, maximizing the minimum requires we examine the 1st Quartile to the exclusion of everything else on the table.</p><p>According to the difference principle, in this hypothetical choice, whichever distribution has the highest annual salary in the 1st Quartile determines what counts as the most just basic structure.</p><p>In this case, the socialized market is what the difference principle requires us to select.</p><p>It isn‚Äôt clear, however, why we should believe Rawls‚Äô assumption that agents behind the veil of ignorance would choose the difference principle; and furthermore, it isn‚Äôt clear why they prefer the distribution of the Socialized Market in the choice represented in Figure 1.</p><p>Why should we think that a rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizing agent with generalized knowledge would make these conclusions?</p><p>There is an untold gap in the story, and it becomes clear with examples. One would like to think that Rawls isn‚Äôt begging the question; surely there are good and plausible bridges over this gap. Consider an exaggerated modification of the table:</p><p>By the difference principle, the socialized market is still chosen in the question presented in Figure 2. But, now, the difference principle as a strategy seems much weaker.</p><p>The economist/gambler in all of us sees the opportunity cost in selecting the socialized market, and here the difference principle doesn‚Äôt seem so reasonable. The odds are really good that you‚Äôll be very, very rich in the feudal economy in Figure 2.</p><p>Figure 2 forces us to entertain the possibility that agents in the original position wouldn't choose the difference principle.</p><p>From behind the veil, not knowing to which quartile one actually belongs, it is reasonable to think that agents might employ the primitive game theory strategy of selecting the structure which provides the highest mean average salary (or look at the structure which brings about the highest sum total of salaries).</p><p>Clearly, this strategy would promote the feudal economy rather than the socialized market in Figure 2.</p><p>‚ÄúBut wait!‚Äù exclaims the proponent of the difference principle. Surely, we can see that you have a 25% chance to be completely impoverished in the feudal economy.</p><p>The fear of ending up on the bottom carries a great deal weight, especially if the bottom quartile ends up with practically nothing, as in the case of the above feudal economy.</p><p>Some proponents of Rawls' difference principle contend the bridge is based upon risk aversion, which is what enables us to rationally deny the feudal economy, greatly increasing the merits of both the socialized economy and the difference principle which selects it.</p><p>What might be the proper account of this risk aversion theory isn't clear. Is it only being risk averse to complete catastrophe, as we saw in Figure 2? And, if so, does this really support the difference principle?</p><p>This example income-to-utility conversion table demonstrates marginal utility. Levels of income are converted to their respective levels of utility. While there is a massive store of literature arguing about these values and determining which empirical study is correct is beyond both the scope of this paper and my expertise, there isn‚Äôt a consensus about the exact formula which maps financial income to utility.</p><p>I‚Äôm providing a theoretical point - I‚Äôm not sure what the end-game empirical tables really look like (and, honestly, I doubt anyone actually has yet).</p><p>I believe the above table is not representative of reality; I think the values for diminishing marginal utility are likely far more extreme and radical.</p><p>The difference between surviving and not surviving (the first couple thousand Euros) seems to have a much higher utility value than the small difference in utility gained from more luxuries.</p><p>If this is true, then the table should be skewed to benefit to lowest levels of income more radically than is presented.</p><p>In weighing the averages or totals of the corresponding utility values, values which are transformatively curved by diminishing marginal utility, it is easy to see why rational utility-maximizing agents in the original position prefer the socialized market from Figure 1.</p><p>Moreover, it seems that the risk aversion theorist has a very potent argument to defend the difference principle (which is what was needed in the first place).</p><p>The primitive argument from Figure 2 is correct about rational decisions being determined by averages, but the argument is wrong to assume a one-to-one correspondence of monetary to utility values.</p><p>Here we see that diminishing marginal utility, which is a form of risk aversion at the low end of the utility spectrum, bridges the gap between the agents as utility-maximizers and the difference principle as a substantive distributive justice schema.</p></div>
