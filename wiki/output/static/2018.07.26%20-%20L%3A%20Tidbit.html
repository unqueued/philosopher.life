<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>I &lt;3 talking with L. We spoke for several hours over Signal.</em></p><p>It may present that way. Autism, imho, is not well understood. It is continually being reshaped in the DSMs, etc. I was lucky enough to study some of the literature at Tulane.</p><p>If I had to reduce it down, I'd have two general things to say:</p><p>(1) Autist people have aneurotypical activations in their rTPJ (<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporoparietal_junction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporoparietal_junction</a>)</p><p>This makes it so they have difficulty forming accurate theories of minds in many contexts.</p><p>or, that their formation of theories of minds isn't typical, and is often based upon cognitive rather than affective empathy initially</p><p>(2) Autistic people _tend_ to have aneurotypical and sometimes misleading pattern-recognition warping and Bayesian predictive coding eccentricities embedded in our autistic preoccupation with and pursuit of precision.</p><p>That is to say, in probabilistic reasoning, autistic people tend to have a profound failure in their modeling.</p><p>If you think of virtue as a golden mean between two vices</p><p>(autism isn't conceptually maladaptive, btw)</p><p>I think of autism as being one kind of Bayesian modeling vice, and on the other end of the spectrum (the opposing vice), I see schizophrenia</p><p>(that isn't to say they can't have overlap, as I said, this is a very poorly understood part of science still)</p><p>Schizophrenic rely too heavily on their models in other ways...</p><p>They will literally hear voices, for example. The science of hearing is fascinating, and it's completely obvious that we fill in the gaps and recode the sense data from our eardrums into the percepts we can actually attend to.</p><p>Their &quot;coding&quot; model overwrites that sense data into hallucination beyond the usual hallucination that already is human hearing.</p><p>That modeling is everywhere, in all kinds of perception, not just hearing</p><p>For example, a deaf schizo will &quot;hear&quot; hallucinations with a visual hand appearing in front of them signing at them.</p><p>Their perceptual modeling overrides their actual sense organs that profoundly</p><p>Autists, in contrast, tend to be extremely sensitive their sense organ data.</p><p>Sensitivity, awareness, is perhaps half of the intelligence equation. Modeling those senses, giving rise to salience from it, etc. is the other half. At least for probabilistic intelligence (Bayesian), which I associate with empirical knowledge (as opposed to Rationalist, innate, apodictic, etc.)</p><p>So...computer-like is not an accurate description of autism in general, imho. There are plenty of autists who fit that stereotype though (I'm one of them, imho)</p><p>(sorry, that was a long fucking answer, lol...but it's a question that I'm still wrestling with to understand how to improve my reasoning and perceptions of the world as best as I can)</p></div>
