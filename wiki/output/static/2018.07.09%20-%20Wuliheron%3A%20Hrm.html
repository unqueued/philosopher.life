<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Your writing expresses fuzzy logic, but it is still basic and immature. Dialtheism is merely another academic oxymoron. They insist that everything be self-consistent, including how they talk about anything being inconsistent. Rather sad.</p><p>I studied contextualism and the Tao Te Ching for decades to master language, and my best advice besides singing, is to cultivate skepticism of anything academics say. Actually pay attention to their Three Stooges slapstick which is often quite transparent. That's the lesson that I learned after decades of intense research, is that academics don't know what the hell they are talking about, but they talk about it in great detail, making it easier to figure it out for yourself.</p><p>My mind has never worked like other peoples' because I never had the luxury of being able to think like them. It is my karma, and a truth that I still struggle to accept as inescapable. Growing up, nobody could comprehend half of what I was talking about and, now, I make Zen masters look silly and Taoist monks contemplate their navels. All because, none of them can comprehend what I say, even if I use nothing by platitudes and commonly used phrases.</p><p>I swore when I was five years old that I would find the words, I'm not that bright really in many respects, don't have my life together in any recognizable fashion, but I am the Wu Li master of the Tao Te Ching, and by surrendering to my words I can talk to mother nature, and am fed at her breast.</p><p>The Taoist masters and many of the Rainbow Warriors know who and what I am, they recognize their brother right away, for many of them are also brain damaged and we have been developing our own culture to defend ourselves from the mindless masses.</p><p>It is for them that I will publish the book I'm writing because, otherwise, there would be little point.</p><p>I study the weaknesses of academics, because they are killing us all mindlessly encouraging everyone to make money and build weapons. This is common knowledge among my people. Somebody figured out how to pollute the environment and build cheap nuclear reactors, and it wasn't the Janitor.</p></div>
