<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Summary:</p><p>You provide us a dilemma in which autonomy is either incoherent or unimportant.</p><p>There are three basic categories of theories for making desires autonomous: historical, structural, and rationalistic theories (and hybrids of these basic categories). All theories have an Autonomy Conferring Process, be it a Mere Authenticity view or an Agent-Government view (not mutually exclusive).</p><p>The strength of mere authenticity views is avoiding the regress, while the weakness, ultimately, are versions of the ab initio problem (you point out several, I think). Mere authenticity views seem to lack the ‚Äúself-governing‚Äù in autonomy, and so perhaps, we should be worried they aren‚Äôt really theories of autonomy at all (even if they are some kind of theory about personal identity and psychology). Even if we were to assume they are theories of autonomy, these accounts are too weak to justify the belief that autonomy is normatively significant (or as significant as we many seem to think). This is the ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù part of the dilemma.</p><p>For the Agent-Government View, ‚Äúone can‚Äôt deliberate from nothing or according to nothing.‚Äù We must have some guiding entities. What are these guiding entities? If the agent does not have power over these entities, then we hit the ab initio problem. If the agent does have these powers, then we hit the regress problem. Since the ab initio problem seems the strongest of the problems, I see the paradox of self-government as the catalyst of the regress problem.</p><p>You see 3 possible ways out: Democratic Government, The Constitutive view, and Pure deliberation. You think they all fail. Hence, autonomy is incoherent on the Agent-Governed view (as are hybrids including its condition)</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>I hope you are wrong. Ha. Great article though. Please, go slowly in class. It seems to me that all the work we‚Äôve been doing so far has been to provide the groundwork, terminology, and context necessary to understand the agenda you have in this paper. If that is true, we may need the opportunity to examine the agenda for more than merely one class period.</p><p>PPS does a whole lot of work for you in this paper. I‚Äôm either don‚Äôt understand your perspective on PPS and sovereignty or I find it to be satisfying. You anticipate (in your footnotes) a lot of objections or questions I want to raise. I‚Äôm not convinced your PPS-based against the mere authenticity view follows in the end, although I think the worry mere authenticity as not really being about autonomy at all is true (and that alone is a sufficient problem for the view).</p><p>I don‚Äôt think I understood how the Democratic Government view obviously fails. It seemed as if it may have a possible similarity to the historical model‚Äôs problems (by the way, it is not so clear to me that Christman doesn‚Äôt have any active, Agent-Government view embedded into his model).</p><p>I don‚Äôt understand how the Constitutive view isn‚Äôt actually a mere authentic view.</p><p>The Pure Deliberation view seems to be ‚Äúpassing the buck‚Äù to the mystery. I see it as another form of the regress problem.</p><hr><p>Making Desires Autonomous:</p><p>Autonomy Conferring Process (what role does the agent play?): Mere authenticity views, agent-government views. (Hybrid‚Äôs being possible, but really this is about a choice about whether or not to incorporate an agent-government condition)</p><p>Can Valdman really prove that agent-government views always render autonomy incoherent?</p><p>Can Valdman really prove that mere authenticity views always render autonomy unimportant? Says he can‚Äôt definitively rule it out.</p><p>Many theories, such as Frankfurt‚Äôs, initially appear to be agent-government views, but they become cashed out in terms of mere authenticity.</p><p>A strength of mere authenticity views is avoiding the regress.</p><p>The crippling weakness of mere authenticity views is that agents are merely passive spectators or bystanders. The intuition is that for one to be autonomous, one must actively govern oneself, and the passitivity of mere authenticity views seems to rule out the possibility of one actually governing oneself.</p><p>To be clear, monitoring and having attitudes about one‚Äôs life, which a non-detached spectator very well may be in the mere authenticity views, is not the same as (and lacks the force of) actively governing, authoring, legislating, or shaping one‚Äôs life.</p><p>Mere authenticity views seem to lack the ‚Äúself-governing‚Äù in autonomy, and so perhaps, we should be worried they aren‚Äôt really theories of autonomy at all (even if they are some kind of theory about personal identity and psychology).</p><p>Even if we were to assume they are theories of autonomy, these accounts are too weak to justify the belief that autonomy is normatively significant (or as significant as we many seem to think).</p><p>There are no solutions to Hume‚Äôs skepticism of induction. There are no solutions to the metaphysical problems of identity (e.g. persistence). There are no solutions to the problems of the external world or other minds. This list can go on and on. There are numerous skeptical problems which are, as of yet, undefeated, and yet we do not agree to be skeptics. Autonomy is right there in the mix. These sorts of problems are special ‚Äì it is allowed, perhaps even reasonable, to beg the question against the skeptic, even in the face of profound, undefeated skeptical arguments.</p><p>Presumption of Personal Sovereignty (PPS), a set of negative rights of autonomous agents against certain kinds of manipulation, coercion, and interference, instead favoring the positive rights of agents to pursue their interests, can‚Äôt be grounded by mere authenticity views.</p><p>Oddly enough, that isn‚Äôt the most important part of autonomy to me. Being autonomous means I am an agent who is morally responsible. That is what makes autonomy so profound. When things are up to me (and to the extent that they are up to me alone), I am responsible. Normative force exists only upon those in those cases where beings are responsible for their choices. Without autonomy, the force of normativity is lost. Nothing is significant and nothing matters without autonomous agents. PPS is merely a subset of the things which follow autonomy enabling normativity in our world.</p><p>It is possible that not all persons are autonomous, and autonomy may come in degrees. The PPS seems to protect all persons, regardless of their autonomic status. The exceptions to or violations of the PPS (e.g. where the agent is hurting others) occur regardless of autonomic status. Autonomy appears neither necessary nor sufficient as grounds for PPS.</p><p>I want to flesh out a point you bring up earlier (footnote 18). It seems that by PPS we just mean to describe an aspect of persons (definitionally). So, I take you to be really saying that autonomy appears neither necessary nor sufficient as grounds for being a person. The real separation is just autonomy and personhood. Conferring personhood, including conferring the rights of personhood (which includes PPS rights), isn‚Äôt a matter of actually possessing autonomy. I agree that personhood isn‚Äôt a matter of actually possessing autonomy, rather it is closer to the matter of having the potential for the capacity of autonomy. I grant personhood rights to many humans who seem to lack autonomy, for perhaps two reasons: 1) they may have the potential for it (e.g. babies), or 2) as a hedge rule, because even in cases where I have at least some reasons to believe the agent isn‚Äôt autonomous (e.g. severe coma patients, a.k.a. vegetables), I don‚Äôt have enough evidence, and it is a real possibility I could be wrong (many supposed vegetables turned out not to be vegetables), and thus it would be better to be conservative in this respect, granting rights to some of those who don‚Äôt actually merit them than to violate the rights of those who do actually have them. In this way, PPS or personhood is still based on autonomy, only indirectly.</p><p>Further, in the exception/violation cases, you‚Äôll notice that not all rights are being violated (or at least I wouldn‚Äôt advocate that). Yes, you should be restrained from illegitimately punching someone else in the face. But, notice, you still have the right to live, and other rights, which aren‚Äôt going to be taken from you. Your rights of personhood are only violated to a limited extent. Having autonomy (or the potential for it) really does enable you to keep some rights. At first glance, this restraint seems to be a violation of your rights, but it not.</p><p>I think you‚Äôve misplaced (or failed to divide) the notion of sovereignty when you say we ‚Äúviolate his sovereignty regardless of his autonomy.‚Äù In one sense, (Broad) sovereignty could be understood as the broadest set of negative rights to use your capacities without interference. On this view, sovereignty isn‚Äôt about the moral law, it is about whether or not you ‚Äúcan‚Äù physically do the things you want to do without interference. In this sense, sovereignty is violated in your account. In another sense, however, sovereignty takes into account the moral law, which limits your negative rights. (Narrow) Sovereignty, on this view, is about whether or not you ‚Äúcan‚Äù physically do the things you want to do in accordance with the moral law. Sovereignty in the first sense, as far as I can tell, doesn‚Äôt mean a lot ‚Äì rights not necessarily in accordance with the moral law are hardly rights at all. So, consider a murderer who loses his rights to do certain things and to govern himself in certain ways; we don‚Äôt violate his sovereign rights in this second sense, as he lost them. In this sense, his sovereignty is not violated, as the murderer lost some measure of sovereignty according to moral law. Sovereignty seems to be about rights to employ autonomy.</p><p>One might link PPS and the duty to respect persons. We might even think we have to respect their desires. You then ask, ‚Äúwhich ones?‚Äù</p><p>First, I don‚Äôt understand what PPS is if it isn‚Äôt part of the duty to respect persons (10). Second, it seems as if we should consider whether or not the desires from which agents acts, and whether or not the acts themselves, are not moral ones. I don‚Äôt know how to draw this line exactly. It seems like that is a good starting place, however.</p><p>I‚Äôm not convinced Christman‚Äôs theory is really that passive. Don‚Äôt you have to choose to resist or not resist? If you aren‚Äôt choosing anything, then it is passive. This is a problem that needs to be fleshed out more in Christman‚Äôs theory, and I think he‚Äôs going to be stuck with an active agent, rather than a passive one, else ‚Äòresistance‚Äô may become far less significant.</p><p>While agent-government views might be able to account for PPS, mere authenticity doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to account for it.</p><p>If the mere authenticity view rejects the ab initio problem, agreeing to the notion that the authentic self arises from inauthentic sources,</p><p>‚ÄúIs there really a big difference between manipulation involved in a self‚Äôs creation and manipulation that seeks to alter an existing self‚Ä¶?... Is it a difference that matters?‚Äù</p><p>‚Äúthat just happened to get there first‚Äù</p><p>We might object to Steve‚Äôs manipulation, regardless of whether it is a manipulation of his authentic or inauthentic self/desires.</p><p>The argument is that the mere authenticity view falls to the ab initio problem.</p><p>Agent-Government View</p><p>agential authority - This is the idea of agents having governing powers or a kind of managerial control over their desires ‚Äì a kind that enables them to assess their desires from a distance, so to speak, and to decide which to act on, to shed, and to ignore.</p><p>One can‚Äôt deliberate from nothing or according to nothing. What are these guiding entities? If the agent does not have power over these entities, then we hit the ab initio problem. If the agent does have these powers, then we hit the regress problem. Since the ab initio problem seems the strongest of the problems, I see the paradox of self-government as the catalyst of the regress problem.</p><p>You see 3 ways out: democratic government, identifying the guiding entities with the agent himself (constituting his practical identity ‚Äì The Constitutive View), managerial control through pure deliberation.</p><p>On an agent-government view, after all, we can‚Äôt have a non-agent-governed desire guiding an agent‚Äôs deliberations over which desires to act on.</p><p>Really? Not even to some degree? Why?</p><p>But if a non-agent-governed desire is at the bottom of it all ‚Äì if agents are ultimately responding to desires that they didn‚Äôt make their own through some process of active engagement ‚Äì then that distinctive feature of agent-government would be lost‚Ä¶</p><p>This is the historical and genetic problem.</p><p>The charge is also that an agent-dictatorship is the only correct model, as it alone provides ‚Äúfinal‚Äù authority instead of merely ‚Äúsome‚Äù authority.</p><p>Constitutive selves seem no different to me an authentic selves.</p></div>
