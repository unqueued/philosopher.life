<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>AB&amp;T's grant came through for me. My tuition (except this trimester), tools ($750 worth), boots ($200), optometrist visit, prescription safety glasses, other supplies (they call it &quot;the bucket&quot;), and even gas money are paid for. I am ecstatic! I wasn't sure how we were going to pay for it, and it is a huge relief to know I don't have to. I'm very lucky, and I have extensively thanked my advocate. She has made it possible for me to succeed.</p><p>Time to feel cocky (and then reign it in):</p><p>My teacher thinks I'm a high-functioning Rainman or something (apparently, after hearing his stories, he has worked with couple autistic savants in his decades of pipefitting).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> I can perform mildly complex arithmetic and basic algebra fairly quickly in my head, and so I can snap answers back to questions he expects his students to take several minutes to solve. The trig aspects are of the job are so standardized that they can just be straight up memorized. I regularly hear praise such as &quot;nobody has ever done it that fast&quot; or &quot;nobody...on the first try&quot; etc. from him (I appreciate the praise, but that's not why I'm doing it); the other students look at me with a mix of awe and disgust (except my friend Nash [nickname for him], who started the program with me). My spatial reasoning is where I believe I'm going to blow him out of the water though. I rock blueprints, transforming objects in my head, etc. In time, with practice, I expect to do much of this CAD, self-made isometric drawing (he prides himself on this), and miniature modeling (they use wire) work in my head instantly.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> It is convenient to instantly understand some things. Hopefully, with hard work and a carefully balanced attitude, I can make up for my many practical deficiencies.</p><p>I actually might do all of the work in 6 months if I can keep up my blistering pace. Unfortunately, I am bottlenecked by Nash. I'm not allowed to progress through certain modules without him at the moment. That means I have to teach Nash as we go along (help him pass his tests and assignments) so he can keep up. Nash seems okay with it though. I like the kid. He has a checkered past for someone his age, but it's fine. It was weird realizing that when I got kicked out of school, he was being born. I feel like an old man. Hell, I am an old man in this class.</p><p>It might be better to go for the full 12 months though. I might try to go for all 4 books instead of the standard 2 for the class. I want to soak up as much as I possibly can while I still can. I could also practice welding. </p><p>I need something like 8k hours to hit journeyman. With hefty overtime (which is par for the course, apparently), I might be able to squeeze the 5-year apprenticeship into 2.5 years. Regardless, I've heard you test into being a helper, and that high-end helpers can make $26 an hour + per diem. That would be sick. </p><p>My teacher loves my idea of using a van (or trailer, or whatever) if I'm traveling for work. </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> And, he's right.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> <em>So modest!...</em> /s, but for real, I believe I will accel in this area. It's also considered the hardest part of the job, which may be good for me. Being a good planner and doing the abstract work effortlessly may give me serious upward mobility. I hope to be someone they desperately need. Keep dat marketability and demand as high as possible.</sub></p></div>
