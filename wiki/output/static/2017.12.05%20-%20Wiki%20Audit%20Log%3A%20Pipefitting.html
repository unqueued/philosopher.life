Clearly out my {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Focus.html">Focus</a>} was very hard work. It's difficult to re-focus.</li><li>Fuck, I clearly have to reset</li></ul><hr><h2 class="">FO:</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Pipefitting.html">Pipefitting</a><ul><li>I did some touch-up work before, so this is much easier. Still plenty of clean-up.</li><li>It's good to be thinking about it again.</li><li>I'm going a bit deeper, since it's worth it, I think.</li></ul></li><li>Post-Mortem<ul><li>-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Philosophy%2520Probe%2520Log.html">Philosophy Probe Log</a><ul><li>Looking back, I actually don't hate my work. In a way, this is just too much work to expect daily. The idea is good. I don't think I have time to do this well though. Should I half-ass this one? Maybe. I'm really busy though. I see it popping up elsewhere on the wiki. Perhaps that is the problem; there is enormous redundancy on this wiki. I can point to 5 other directories that are doing this work. Simplify!</li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Family%2520Wikis%2520Log%2520Collection.html">Family Wikis Log Collection</a><ul><li>This is interesting to me still. We are slowly bringing it back. I am more convinced than ever that my children need to talk to themselves, to plan on their wikis, and to learn to empathize with themselves through this tool. However, I'm not sure if this Log Collection was actually useful. In fact, it was around this time that my family began to stop even writing their wikis. I am very critical. I need to rethink how to do this well, kindly, and productively. </li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Homeschooling%2520Log.html">Homeschooling Log</a><ul><li>This fell apart. I keep trying. I feel like I'm pulling more weight than anyone here trying to get this to work (and I've had more time to do so; with great power comes great responsibility). I have to be stoic. Not everything is in my control. I will not give up though. Right now, I'm stuck with the organic process we have. I need my children to become more formal and rigorous in their planning for themselves. My children need to use their wikis.</li><li>I need my wife to engage in the behavior that my children need to engage in. We have to be good role models, and it has to be a family effort. She takes them to church, and I take them to themselves in the wiki. We clearly have fundamental disagreements on what actually works in being existential. I am continually convinced that this CBT method has excellent empirical evidence behind its efficacy; and when I look at those who go to church, I am continually convinced they generally suck at being existential. Keep going to church, but use this tool. This is the most ideally Christian tool (whatever I still respect about Christianity) I've ever seen.<ul><li>Why is my wife resistant to using her wiki? It seems like it fits her so well. Nobody wants to do it. I feel like a Democrat trying to Convince Republicans, or a Socialist trying to convince Democrats, etc. This is wisdom in practice. I know it. I have studied wisdom too long not to know it when I see it.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Cry%2520Log.html">Cry Log</a><ul><li>Uh, I see a pattern. I just gave up on them. That's part of why my stress stopped to some extent, although I still had plenty of stress just working my ass off. Trying to convince my family members to be wise puts enormous strain on me. When I'm egoistically stoic, when I just &quot;let them be who they are,&quot; (which is not what the loving person does in all contexts), when I stop even trying to help them talk to themselves, my life is easier.</li><li>This is part of my rising blood pressure again.</li><li>Note, of course, that this was also a time of intense change. Look at what happened in those months. It was very difficult. I can see that difficulty is going to come back. I'm glad to keep this in the vault. I may need it again.</li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Unbottled%2520Frustrations%2520Log.html">Unbottled Frustrations Log</a><ul><li>Breaking point there.</li><li>I am missing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3's%2520Log.html">h0p3's Log</a>, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a> has taken on some of those duties, very clearly.
