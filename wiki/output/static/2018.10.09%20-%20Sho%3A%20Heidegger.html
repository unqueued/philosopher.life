7 hours ago
 at least doing my masters got me exposure to some feminist/contemporary philosophy, that was nice
7 hours ago
 this 'present at hand' mode is clearly necessary for both survival and enjoyment
7 hours ago
 fuck Heidegger lol
7 hours ago
 Heidegger was an awful human being.
7 hours ago
 I always said it's appropriate that 'Kant' sounds like 'cunt'. He's the one I hate the most
7 hours ago
 no, i take it back
7 hours ago
 descartes
7 hours ago
 cause he started the whole dualism thing
7 hours ago
 fuck descartes
7 hours ago
 you  konw what? fuck most of them
7 hours ago
 lol
7 hours ago
 lol
7 hours ago
 as far as my transcription... to the extent that it's paying me to live in the middle of nowhere, it all deserves to be transcribed lol
7 hours ago
 but in terms of topic
7 hours ago
 i mean ...
7 hours ago
 there is a lot of market research and focus groups and that kind of crap
7 hours ago
 business-centric and such
7 hours ago
 but because I work for a few companies I get a fair bit of variety, which i uite like
7 hours ago
 today i finished the welsh brewers thing and then  i typed an interview with the UK's main polar bear scientist about how we're fucked cause the ice is going to be gone in 12 years or whatever
7 hours ago
 other topics that i'm glad to do are tehcnology, you know
7 hours ago
 caus eit means i'm learning a bit about what is happenin gin the world, 'behind the scenes', even
7 hours ago
 that is neat
7 hours ago
 as it's high heidyuns in business, you know
7 hours ago
 so, that's cool
7 hours ago
 sometimes it'll be personal stuff
7 hours ago
 I assume you have to sign an NDA
7 hours ago
 sometimes it's people interviewing indian lassies that have been raped
7 hours ago
 oh of course
7 hours ago
 i'd get fired for telling you all that right now lol
7 hours ago
 so it can pretty much be anything
7 hours ago
 anyone willing to pay for transcription
7 hours ago
 i vastly prefer one-to-one interviews, mainly because they're just easier to type (don't have to spend time indicating a new speaker or trying to match voices across a group to figure out who the hell said what, argh!)
7 hours ago
 lol
7 hours ago
 but they tend to flow better
7 hours ago
 they're more of a story
7 hours ago
 usually
7 hours ago
 aye, basically
7 hours ago
 business, academic, personal, people doing books or telly
7 hours ago
 anything
7 hours ago
 what percentage of errors are  you allowed?
7 hours ago
 eh, lowest possible lol
7 hours ago
 it depends on the piece
7 hours ago
 and the quality of the audio
7 hours ago
 I wonder if they pay two people to transcribe and compare the results or something, or maybe do that once in a while as an error-rate indicator.
6 hours ago
 oh no, i dno't think theyd do that
6 hours ago
 i think it would cost them too much
6 hours ago
 i mean, each compnay has their own way of doing things
6 hours ago
 but generally what happens is that if you turn in a poor piece of work, they tell yu
6 hours ago
 and note it
6 hours ago
 if it happens again, they may give you less work, or none at all
6 hours ago
 one of the companies, if they have issues with a transcript they'll put it out for someone else to go over, for a reduced rate (and obv the person who did the poor work to start with gets a reduced rate)
6 hours ago
 these places test you before they give you any work, obviously
6 hours ago
 which helps them gauge your prowess on accuracy and grammar/etc., cause that all has to be perfect, too
6 hours ago
 luckily i'm just naturally good at that crap
6 hours ago
 and i type fast
6 hours ago
 so it means this job works for me
6 hours ago
 yeah, I'm curious how they continually quality test
6 hours ago
 you get paid per audio minute
6 hours ago
 so the faster you can get something done the more you earn
6 hours ago
 is it easier to go over something already largely transcribed?
6 hours ago
 well aye I suppose so
6 hours ago
 but that's a different job, then
6 hours ago
 that's proofreading
6 hours ago
 as they call it
6 hours ago
 as opposed to transcribing
6 hours ago
 to be fair, some companies are pretty slack about their QA
6 hours ago
 but not most, obviously
6 hours ago
 What makes a good canon to you?
1 hour ago
 What did you get your masters in?</code></pre></div>
