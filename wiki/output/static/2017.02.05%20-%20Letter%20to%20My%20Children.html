<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I love you.</p><p>I don't even know what love means yet (and from what I can tell, I may never fully), but I love you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button></p><p>You and I don't know what that fully entails yet. That's okay. Son and Daughter of mine, if I could end my life to make yours happy, I would. If only I had that option! My life, from inception to death, is an experiment gone wrong. This is not your fault, and all I can do is try my best to help you be systematically happy. I must shield and cultivate you. You must stand on my shoulders: breathe the fresh air, do not drown in the chaos!  I am yours.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> I have been through a version of hell to be with you. I am sorry for who I am, my deficiencies and imperfections, and the pain that I have caused you. I am not the creator you deserve.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> All I have is yours. I love you.</p><p>My mother once said something like these words to me. I hope I can only build on what she said. We must find hope in our tragedy, a reason to live, and you are my reason. Creators are indebted to their creations because it wasn't the creations' fault that they came into being. If there is moral responsibility, then creators are responsible for their creations. </p><p>I do not know how free we are. I wish I did. I wish I knew the meaning, the concept, the source, the criterion, the conditions, and the groundwork and foundations. I wish I had the answers for you. I do not. I am sorry. I don't know what life you will live. I can't see that far. I desperately hope it is a happy one. We each have our own plight, minds and reality maps, contexts, accidents and plans. I am an unprepared, fallible, and flawed creator. I am truly sorry for the ways in which I've failed you.</p><p>I will do my best for you. </p><p>I love you.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Yes, that sounds like a contradiction. It isn't. How can I say I'm engaging in something which I don't even understand? I don't know. Let us call it the magic of bootstrapping and hope. I do not understand the paradoxes of love, but I will do my best. It's all I have.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> Kantians cannot give good reasons for self-sacrifice. It is one of the fundamental flaws in their work. I am here to sacrifice myself for you. I don't believe Jesus was God (since I don't believe in God), but if there was a human Jesus (surely he existed; it's a helluva meme), I'd like to think he fundamentally understood sacrifice. It is such a special notion. It is the tragic exchange, losses, and transactions of those things we hold most dear, where we trade with objects whose values reach beyond our comprehension. We are monkeys trading existential gems.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">3 : </span> Which is not the claim that there is a Creator we deserve.</sub></p></div>
