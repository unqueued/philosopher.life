<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>We started studying the valves chapter today. It was a very difficult section. My teacher, lazy as he is, even had a handout for it to attempt to make up for the fact that we had no valves to inspect in person. I read the chapter, filled out the handout, and continued studying. Chris and I were the only ones really studying. Oh, yeah, everyone took the same test today. We've caught up, and they were shocked. Lol. But, seriously, I really want to understand valves. I believe it will be the specialty I pursue. </p><p>We cleaned up the shop, even squeegeed. </p><p>Each of us was individually brought into the teacher's office to go over our grades. My teacher decided to deduct 20% of my productivity and attendance grade because I missed a single day. Lol. In reality, he needs to give me &quot;room to grow.&quot; It reminds me of Thai culture, where teachers felt that if they gave perfect scores then they were useless or failed to challenge their students or demonstrate superiority, whatever. I don't care. Lol. Graduation doesn't matter. Learning in the shop, my teacher's recommendation (I still have a very high A in his class), and getting my certifications are all that matter. When it comes to degrees, I have plenty of them. I have little respect for the institution itself. I'm here for knowledge and practice, not the piece of paper that's meaningless (even the certs may turn out useless outside of something to flash to get my foot in the door).</p><p>They started mounting even more &quot;Snap-On<sup>tm</sup>&quot; signs around my building (in addition the Trane<sup>tm</sup> signs). I feel like a student in one of those schools funded by cigarette companies. It is gross. I cannot believe an institution of learning would do this...except that I can. =(</p></div>
