<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m level 67 at the moment, and√Ç  I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had a good time. I appreciate how well-crafted TBC has been. Mind you, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t run too many quests (until I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m max level, then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably pick the ones that have good rewards). So, mainly I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been grinding. The grind has been just that, a grind. I have leveled faster than I thought I would though.</p><p>I was going to level up my ghetto 500ap 3.5khp 16% crit, newly made 60 rogue with a build that could PvP (Hemo build, with weaponswap for daggers√¢‚Ç¨¬¶the new 21/8/22 for me at the time). &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=ihtfox0oZhZEMss0hRo&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=ihtfox0oZhZEMss0hRo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=ihtfox0oZhZEMss0hRo&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=ihtfox0oZhZEMss0hRo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt</a>;</p><p>Of course, when TBC actually came out, I quickly found out that I needed a grinding build, at least until I got some equipment upgrades. So, eventually I decided upon a heavy sub grinding spec√¢‚Ç¨¬¶with a twist that has worked out great for me. &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=whxboZhbxzZxMjohhRso&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=whxboZhbxzZxMjohhRso&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=whxboZhbxzZxMjohhRso&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=whxboZhbxzZxMjohhRso&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt</a>;. While originally my heavy sub grind build (which has outperformed combat for me while grinding) never had any combat points, I decided to give riposte a test run (I know it was quite powerful when I was combat). To my pleasant surprise, it turned out very well. I found that the AP sacrifices were worth it, especially if and when I got adds. With evasion (which you could pop liberally), fighting multiples was actually pretty easy, considering Setup + multiple parries for riposte, I could mow through adds when I got them.</p><p>Now, that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m slightly more geared, 1100AP + 7k hp + 16% crit, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been having my usual PvP urges. I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take it anymore!! When TBC first came out, everyone was all carebear, everyone was grinding, and nobody PvPed or ganked. But, people are human, oh yeah, you know you have those urges too, and they started ganking. The first few I just let go, but after a while I knew I needed revenge. So, as I am frankly tired of grinding, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve respecced, hopefully for a final time until 70 (I spend far too much money respeccing), so that I could PvP. Right now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m using:</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=iheboxooZhZxMjohhRsho&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=iheboxooZhZxMjohhRsho&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=iheboxooZhZxMjohhRsho&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=iheboxooZhZxMjohhRsho&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt</a>;</p><p>While it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sport the weaponswap for daggers, it does keep setup and camo, which are both fun and keep me sane while grinding (I &lt;3 Camo). The build keeps the fundamental combat structure for grinding, but most importantly it gives back my beautiful, wonderful, most exalted Cold Blood. I can certainly feel not having riposte or the extra points in the heavy sub agi/AP talents, but it is SO worth it for me.</p><p>Despite previous ill-will towards a certain 31-point talent in the sub tree, especially at pre-61, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve grown quite addicted to it as well. Pre-TBC, premed was simply not as good as cold blood. But, now that I can have both, I will sing premeditation√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s praises! On the gank, with MoS, Premed-CB-CS-Evisc is a 3k open. They start the fight at 25-40% health inside a CS-lock? Yes, please. Even if premed is substandard for dueling, it is hella√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ fun elsewhere, and truly shines for pure rush downs with cold blood (when control doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter to you).</p><p>My zombie-grind mind is now loving the game even more as I come back to PvPing and ganking. Beat a 70 Hunter that opened on me yesterday, and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve found paladins MUCH easier to kill, I cut through them like butter. Crack that turtle, and you win. The pleasure of hemo is now that I have a choice: I can burst or I can stunlock as usual.</p><p>My favorite improvement for the rogue class has been survivability.</p><p>1.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  My HP levels are wonderful (for greens at least). I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m no longer getting 2-shotted by anyone. I can take a few hits, I can take multiples much easier. In both PvE and PvP it is nice to be able to take a few hits. I suspect that at 70 we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to choose between high survivability or high damage in PvE (opting for damage of course). The itemization is obviously setup to split rogues up into highest ap/crit or survivability with some AP. For me, as I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an HP-whore, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll definitely opt for the survivability.</p><p>2.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  Cloak of Shadows. While this was very nice pre-TBC, having it trained is just the amazing. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually GLAD they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put this on prep, 1-minute CD for something this powerful is broken. I secretly think this will have to be nerfed. We are officially escape artists. If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually paying attention to my screen, unless I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stunlocked to death, I am pretty much ungankable. This might be more powerful than prep as far as I am concerned. This is usable in stealth too√¢‚Ç¨¬¶totally awesome. Simply a savage ability.</p><p>Problems, concerns, etc.</p><p>a.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  I have noticed that eviscerates seem lower than usual for me. I used to hit consistently harder (on the same mobs even). But, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not complaining about it, the math checks out (as it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t before).</p><p>b.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  Envenom is lackluster. Nothing new here. I probably won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be using this ability.</p><p>c.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  Weapon itemization is pretty awful for hemo rogues. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve yet to see good replacements for my HWL 2.9 MH. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m wondering if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to be forced into daggers for this reason (or heavens no, forced into imp SS)</p><p>d.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still not fully satisfied with our functionality in groups. Imp sap has been very useful, but beyond that, I feel my role is comparatively not as vital as others, and that my role is crowded by a lot of classes. I realize this the plague of the DPS class, but I think further evaluation of rogue function is necessary.</p><p>e.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  Engineering, wtf happened to my beloved engineering?</p><p>f.)√Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç  Shadowstep still needs a lot of work from where I stand. The opportunity costs aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worth it at this point. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m betting they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll buff this ability, but until then, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not pleased with its performance as a 41 point talent.</p><p>Props to:</p><p>1.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  Master of Sub: 10% damage is top flight. This, DD and initiative compose the core engine behind sub builds. The more and more I play, the more I appreciate this ability.</p><p>2.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  Cold blood. While it probably isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t as powerful as it once was, dictating crits is so powerful. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s little brother premed makes it even better, even for PvE! Sap 1, Premed-CS-CB-Evisc-GS number 2, rush down number three, gg? With evasion it gets even better.</p><p>3.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  The zonewide PvPish objectives, really a lot of fun, especially for a rogue.</p><p>4.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  18-slot bags that are dirt cheap (cost me 10g per bag as I had most of the mats already from grinding).</p><p>5.)√Ç √Ç √Ç  More interesting content in PvE and instances.</p><p>TBC has really brought me back to loving the rogue class once again. I really love playing a rogue again. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m even enjoying bits and pieces PvE (and that has been years since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve even remotely care about PvE√¢‚Ç¨¬¶like, Everquest years ago). Two thumbs up for Blizzard for a high quality expansion.</p></div>
