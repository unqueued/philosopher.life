<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I walked through the turnstile, since it was Saturday. That was the last procedure I was given. No vans showed up. It got late enough that I decided to walk the 200 yards to our area of the plant. The van passed me on the way. I am told the driver called us walkers dumbasses. I think it was a practical solution to my superior's failure to communicate. Nobody has said anything directly to me, and there weren't any announcements so far.</p><p>It is still unclear if Chester will be leaving the job, which I've heard is quite untypical (which makes sense).</p><p>This morning was a furious flurry of activity. Chris-M and I were asked to make the cuts instead of the fitters on the site yesterday. This was an emergency. We then had to absolutely rush to make the rest of the bevel because they wanted it mounted immediately. Let me toot my own horn again: I can fucking bevel. I can sculpt with that grinder. I'm getting a knack for using the right size grinder and switching between rock and tiger paw at the right time as well.</p><p>Also, the A5 crew were brought to A1 to finally begin mounting and rigging up the saddle piece way up on the riser. I think Dave was still unhappy about the area I did my cleanup grind on the riser, but I believe I covered the right space. It doesn't matter, I had an emergency to deal with (he agreed) and so he sent 2 others to work on. Yet again, I believe they will run into scaffold problems on the left side. The welders have been warned by me. Everyone seems to hate our scaffold builders and for good reason.</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>So, we spent over 3 hours trying to fit this thing into place. There was an obstructing I-beam that made it so we couldn't drop it into place. At which point, I said we should just take the saddle off the pipe and mount the saddle individually. Greg raised his hand, and then had to tell me, give me a high-5. He said that is exactly what they should be doing, but that nobody was going to listen since David Lobour has been calling the shots with Chester, asking us to dumb and dangerous things.</p><p>This was pretty awful. I stayed out of it and talked instead. The riser of the main was untacked at the base, and they used come-alongs and pry bars to eventually squeeze it into place. Now, I've done this before plenty of times with smaller pipe, but this was dumb and dangerous. They also used the fucking scaffold as the leverage point for 4-by-4's to squeeze it into place. The frame they connected to on the comealong was no designed for this, and they have now mispositioned the header. Any mistake or anything that went wrong was likely going to injure or kill people. Greg and Oliver shook their heads. They walked me through the stupidity of this job in general, yet again. They are right. I'm going to stay safer than we've been. </p><p>Greg and Oliver explained that Yates talks the talk on safety, they have all the paperwork to back it up, but then they do shit like this all the time. While better than SMS is many respects, Yates still isn't the quality or safety I'm looking for.</p><p>Electrician's Union keeps looking better and better. I need to finish this job, sock a way a ton in the bank, get my NCCER journeyman cert, finish my wiki study on pipefitting, and then move into the electrical trade.</p><p>Finding my niche here isn't going to be easy. Keep searching though. This is like playing any video game. I need to see how the classes operate, how they fit together, how they compare, and I need to have some experience with a broad range of them before I can make a good decision. Of course, the analogy isn't perfect. There are too many classes and subclasses, etc. I can't learn the entire game, but only a sliver of it. I must made inductive judgment calls all over the place. Do your best, h0p3.</p><p>Lunch started late, 12:15 for me. Cool beans.</p><h2 class="">Lunch!</h2><p>And, the fitup was complete. The flanges aren't square, but Chris-M thinks they are damned close. We moved onto getting that shit tacked and then removing the bolts. This is why I think there is something very wrong, btw. We had a monster of a time getting bolts out of one side. It was not a nice fit. The scaffold, again, sucks balls. It's narrowness, in this case, made our work even more dangerous since the piece was liable to pop and swing out. It took a lot of prying, chain fall, and crane work, but we got them out. We got the piece out of there, cleaned up, and left the welders to finish the job on the saddle.</p><p>Afterwards, we began some work on threadolets meant to go on the 4 tie-in pipes to the header. These are not on the drawings, but have been an afterthought they decided to have us add. I'm told this is quite normal. It was pretty normal as SMS too, imho.</p><h2 class="">Break!</h2><p>I made my layout marks for the threadolets. I adore my centerfinder. I wish such tools could have levels in all 3 directions.</p><p>I then had to find a way to draw 2 hope lines around the base of the riser with a trunion. It isn't level. It is a hard problem if you want to be accurate </p></div>
