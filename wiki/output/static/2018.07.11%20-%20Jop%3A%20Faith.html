<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>One thing I like about Jop is how consistently charitable she is to my position. We come from radically different backgrounds, barely speak the same natural language, and often I'm unable to compress my representation of my reality map down into something which viably depicts who I am, what I'm thinking, etc. to her (and, obviously, even to myself with this wiki!<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button>). </p><p>Jop has an openness to her which I admire, and I often wish I had more of that in me. </p><p>We talked about my loss of Christian faith, which has been a perplexing thing for her to watch over the years. She has broached the issue many times with me, but I've been unable to communicate it effectively enough to her. I will continue trying.</p><p>We talked again about the topic. I feel bad that she is sad about it. I do my best to gently and carefully say it. I owe it to her; I must be charitable!</p><p>I ended up sending her <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Matrix.html">The Matrix</a> over Resilio Sync. We talked a briefly about Plato's Cave analogy and the movie. She asked if it was a film her kids could watch. I told her my stance on it, that my children have watched it several times, etc. But, I told her that she and her husband had a different view on what was acceptable for their children, and so I tried to walk her through various aspects of the film which might be problematic in their eyes.</p><p>I hope she watches it and thinks more about it. I am worried she will be too literal about it or perhaps still fail to see what I really mean. The things I point to are often complex, and since I'm so <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a>, I will always do a poor job of representing these things to myself as well (let alone across this enormous cultural gap).</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> And, I wrote the blasted thing, lol.</sub></p></div>
