<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I've set up 3 nodes to support your dat. One doesn't seem to work consistently, but I'll see what I can do about it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/dark-v-light" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/dark-v-light</a></p><p>Yeah, it‚Äôs not practical for me to make custom styles for every user of my website‚Äîperhaps that‚Äôs where your troubled feelings arise.
</p></blockquote><p>Again, you point to the dialectic in <em>dark v light</em>. <code>/hug</code></p><p>You've definitely got me thinking about my feelings here. I can't say I've a satisfactory answer.</p><p>I don't expect or predict you to make custom styles for every user of your site. I didn't mean to imply that either. I also think dark modes are so directly functional that I hesitate to even call them aesthetic.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">c</sup></button> In any case, I suggest this isn't an issue of how I use your site, but more an issue of how I reproduce artifacts from your site. I am concerned that I speak on your behalf with your whostyle, and I aim to do you justice.</p><p>My feelings go in multiple directions here. As I said in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.09.25%2520-%2520kickscondor%253A%2520Style.html">2018.09.25 - kickscondor: Style</a> and indirectly elsewhere, I purposely go out of my way to reign in (though not abstain from) my pursuit of the aesthetic (which is not to say I succeed). I also know that the aesthetic is extremely important to you and how you may reason about self-expression. I aim to respect that desire insofar as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a> obligates and permits it. </p><p>As a reader,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> I feel like it is my moral right to modify what I'm looking at. You sent me packets of information from your server, and assuming I've met the usual deontic side-constraints and consequentialist considerations, I am morally permitted (and even sometimes obligated) to use and modify the data you've served however I wish (that's a good thing!).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">b</sup></button> I use tools to make the web easier on my eyes (though, I don't feel like I'm all that picky),<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">l</sup></button> but some people go on to use tools like <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylish" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stylish</a><button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button> and beyond. Those are primarily the aesthetic considerations too. Building many kinds of contraptions to scrape and interact with your site in a more programmatic manner is also a reader's prerogative. I have no troubled feelings at all here; I rejoice at the chance to shape how I interpret your work to fit my context.</p><p>As I writer,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.04</sup></button> however, I feel a sense of obligation to display your whostyle as accurately as I can. Misquoting your whostyle aesthetic may matter quite a bit to you; I couldn't be sure given our previous discussions. While I have my usual doubts, I cannot deny it is possible your aesthetic syntax is important enough to your semantics that I have failed to accurately quote you by having displayed it differently than you intended. Accuracy comes in degrees, and I'm trying to live up to your intentions and explicit expressions when I represent your writing (plus, I think it's cool!). It is integrity and perhaps a matter of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Straussian.html">Straussian</a> charity to me. If it is reasonable to say it: I do not wish to strawman your aesthetic.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">w</sup></button></p><p>Whether or not we can or should peel the reader and writer apart is a matter I cannot answer effectively enough. I could easily be wrong.</p><p>Also, you have probably seen it, but just in case: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.jamesyu.org/hyperliterature.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.jamesyu.org/hyperliterature.html</a></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">c : </span> When I played League of Legends, I had to choose the colorblind mode in order to even see what was happening on the screen.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">a : </span> I adore the <em>As a X</em> meme.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">b : </span> Beaker excels here, right?</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">s : </span> <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/08/16/stylish-is-back-and-you-still-shouldnt-use-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://robertheaton.com/2018/08/16/stylish-is-back-and-you-still-shouldnt-use-it/</a></sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">l : </span> I also try to make it less noisy (gimme dat signal, yo) and prevent others from using me as mere means through what amounts to a 21st-century empowered mind-control we call: marketing and advertisement (I can only do so much to prevent surveillance).
