<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I am a man who tends to remember his disagreements with others for a long time, much like shower thoughts and anxieties we relive. The last time I saw my brother's SO, I had been explaining that I thought my son was born about a month late. Normally, even when she disagrees with me, she doesn't treat me like I'm stupid. This time, she laughed at me in a very superior tone, like I was an idiot. She claimed it was impossible (note, this woman has never been pregnant or gone through the process, although she is fairly intelligent and knowledgeable). That irked me. </p><p>To be clear, I think I had excellent evidence. I know the signs of my wife being pregnant from our previous pregnancy (although, they differ). When the doctor told us (i.e. estimated) the date of conception, and I disagreed then as well (you may accuse me of bias right here). I thought it was earlier given my wife's symptoms. I'm not a doctor, but I know my wife better than the doctor does by far. A month before my son was born, my wife went into labor.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> He was the right weight and size to be born, but they artificially prevented the birth because of what the doctor said. We waited a month, and then we had the birth. My son was born 9 pounds; he was a huge, in the 90th percentile for weight. However, except for the first month or so, my son has always remained in bottom 25th percentile of weight.</p><p>The fact is, some women do give birth to their children 3-4 weeks beyond the average gestation period. I'm strongly convinced that occurred in our case. Hence, I was annoyed by being laughed at.</p><p>Part of the problem is her inability to understand the epistemic limits and the role of science. She's not philosophical about it, in fact, that's often the larger problem I encounter with her.</p><p>I have no control over her ignorance. I am often correct when other people do not believe. I should not feel bad about it, and I shouldn't let it get to me. I could be wrong, but that doesn't make me unjustified in my belief either. It's okay. I need to let it go. I need to focus on what matters, on what I do have control over.</p><hr><p>My brother also doesn't want to be philosophical with me to some large extent. It's a sacrifice in his happiness he doesn't want to make. I'm not sure what he really wants; although, I think he doesn't even understand what he really wants, and he's too scared and hurt to look. He needs a big existential hug. He needs to cry and wrestle. It's not in my power either. I can only be kind. </p><p>I will be philosophical with or without him. Indeed, whether or not someone engages with me via my wiki is a key litmus test. It is weird to say that, outside of my wife, my best friend doesn't care that much what I write here. It is painful and difficult, I realize. Kant and Aristotle in gimpsuits? I don't know. He is right; he's broken. Unfortunately, I can't fix him. I can only be there for him and hope he chooses to fix himself.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> My wife read this during family time and pointed out that she was also born a month late. They had to induce labor on her mother. This may or may not be salient.</sub></p></div>
