Therefore, I am sorry, but the DCK meditation is actually embedded in the wiki itself today. You will need to look through the snapshots to see the structural changes I'm trying to make. Crazy wild man on drugs changing his wiki here. Yup. It's important that I can literally change anything while on DCK. That's part of how it works.</p><p>Essentially, I need happier parts of my wiki. I've got plenty of brutal honesty. I've even got practical metamodern work. I don't have enough dreams on here.

I need to learn more about this man. We need closure. He is incredibly gifted with language (My God, Man). He may even be a genius. I know it when I see it. He is an empath.

It changed me forever. Transformation.</p><p>I should develop a relationship with Fred de Rosset. Maybe not. He has the missionary kid background to understand.

Fred was brilliant. I saw it. Before my very eyes. These professors were like gods to my wife and I. The status redpilled relationship godlike structure thing is gross. whatever. move past it. The fact is that these people were our idols.</p><p>Idol is such an interesting word.
