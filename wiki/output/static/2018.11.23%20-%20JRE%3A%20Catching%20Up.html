<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I've been out of touch with my brother for the past couple of days. It was excellent to have a conversation with him. We talked about our Thanksgivings. He helped me process it.</p><p>My brother gave me excellent advice about a redflagged social consideration, and he is clearly worried about me with good reason. He gently warned me about my openness and transparency here as well.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">r</sup></button> I am not as worried as he is, but he made damned good points; I am now on higher alert for it. He continued to inspect this problem with me from many angles with solid examples and parallels. He is a reliable indicator in a variety of social considerations that I am not. Even if he feels like he is a one-eyed man leading the blind, I am extremely grateful to him for looking out for me and giving me advice; I clearly need it. He has given me much to think about.</p><p>My brother is sleeping A LOT! He is in depression sleep territory right now. He's thinking about other meds. He's having a hard time feeling motivated, though he still has control over himself to get stuff done.</p><p>He went to a new therapist. She was quirky, opinionated, clearly open to surprising things, and my brother is going to see her again.</p><p>He is enjoying his time with Rebecca. He is less anxious about a baby, but the last meeting they attended made it clearer to Rebecca that in utero and genetic predispositions will likely make even baby adoption problematic in the long-term. I will also suggest that her own genetics may be a problem. I think there are problems in both our families.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">r : </span> Including this sentence, it is not often that someone makes me hesitate to write something down in this wiki.</sub></p></div>
