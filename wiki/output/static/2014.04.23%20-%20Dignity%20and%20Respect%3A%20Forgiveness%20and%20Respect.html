<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Forgiveness is a lot like the word Love when it comes to conceptual analysis. There are so many different definitions for various groups through history.</p><p>Griswold offers us an interesting conceptual and phenomenological analysis of forgiveness. It is conceptually linked to the notion of resentment. Forgiveness seems to be a moral act, done for the right reasons, about moderating and taking the steps to let go of resentment. Exactly all of what counts as resentment isn‚Äôt clear (although he leaves us many clues).</p><p>It is not immediately obvious how forgiveness relates so strongly to respect other than as how resentment may be an issue of indignation and believing you have a certain dignity which brings with it a certain set of rights. It is a different angle though, which may be important.</p><p>Virtue theoretic accounts are always so squishy, vague, and indeterminate. These accounts often make it difficult to see those things for which we can or can't be responsible, and often don‚Äôt provide us a legitimate decision procedure. I liked the conditions for forgiveness which Griswold sets out, and he seems to break the mold in some ways. Even though I‚Äôm not sure what this paper reveals to us about respect, I admire the piercing understanding of the practicalities of moral life offered in this paper.</p><hr><p>The definition of forgiveness doesn't come from academic philosophy. Like the word &quot;love&quot; it has so many different definitions for various groups through history. I take this to be a kind of conceptual analysis. </p><p>Maybe he needs to define resentment. Ok, he does. Resentment is &quot;a species of moral hatred that is 'deliberate' rather than sudden, is aroused by the perception of what we take to be unwarranted injury, embodies a judgment about the fairness of an action or of an intention to do that action, is provoked by moral not natural evil, is aimed at the action's author, and is a reactive as well as retributive passion that instinctively seeks to exact a due measure of punishment.&quot; (39)</p><p>His examples of cancer, the economy, and politicians are poor ones. I can easily think of ways these would fit the requirements of resentment.</p><p>&quot;Moral anger&quot; is tied to forgiveness and resentment. That is the conceptual analysis, the definition.</p><p>I ask for forgiveness for accidentally stepping on someone's foot (even when I'm doing my best not to). I want forgiveness for it. That doesn't jive with the top of 40.</p><p>Forgiveness: &quot;letting go of resentment for moral reasons, as well as of revenge, without forgetting the wrong that was done, and even in some cases (re)accepting the offender as a friend&quot; (40)</p><p>Mental act + for the right reasons. Forgiveness does need to be a moral act. A choice. It can't be something else. It is a special case of abandoning resentment or anger, a moral one.</p><p>How does one &quot;overcome&quot; one's feelings? I'm not sure how much control I have over what I am feeling, although I have control over what I do, and to some extent, what I will focus on. It may not be up to me to let go of my resentment, but does Griswold need forgiveness to be an action? Maybe.</p><p>Resentment is quansi-cognitive emotion, forgiveness is about appropriately moderating resentment and a commitment to work toward a frame of mind in which even that resentment is let go. Ok. Whatever is up to you then, that is what is required by forgiveness??</p><p>It isn't necessarily a completed achievement of totally forswearing resentment.</p><p>Virtue theoretic accounts are always so crazy squishy, indeterminate, failing to see those things for which we can or can't be responsible, and unable to provide a legitimate decision procedure. When all else fails, however, virtue theories are all we have left. Sometimes virtue ethicists have piercing, deep understanding of the practicalities and perceptions of moral life. I am lucky to read what they say.</p><p>Hampton's argument on 44 is very appealing. Griswold fights against it somewhat. Resentment contains indignation.</p><p>This was an interesting conceptual and phenomenological analysis of forgiveness. It is not immediately obvious how it to relates so strongly to respect other than as how resentment may be an issue of indignation and believing you have a certain dignity which brings with it a certain set of rights. It is a different angle though, which is important.
