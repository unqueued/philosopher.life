 Hey! It's been a nightmare, not gonna lie, lol. I cant remember the last update I gave yall but hes on hospice. The doctors are pretty sure he has prostate cancer and ots spread to his brain and other places. This is in addition to the alzheimers So his mind is gone, but he still has upper body strength and enough strength to stand. But not enough coordination to walk so hes a fall risk. So someone has to be with him 24/7. It's a small hospital so there's not enough staff for them to watch him so it's been me, mom, and my aunt sharon rotating shifts. 

While all that has been going in, shirley (my grandmother) has had a blood pressure of 200/something and had to go to the ER. While there they realized she might have Parkinson's so were taking her to a neurologist next week. My uncle leslie (moms brother) lives in Memphis and hes a raging diabetic and passed out, fell, and it took him eight hours before he could crawl to the phone to call us. We had to drive two hours one way, clean up his literal shit and vomit, and drive him two hours back home for the weekend where we could take care of him. We didnt get back til 3am. 

It's been an absolute shit show down here, lol.

 You must be emotionally exhausted

 Its been a lot. Honestly it's all been so go go go for the last two weeks that I haven't been able to slow down enough to be tired, if that makes sense.

 yes =(

 Being the lubricant and glue for your family in crisis can be sacrificial. I bet you are going to need to take some serious &quot;me time&quot; when you eventually have the chance.

 It must be really difficult to be away from Adam this long.
1 hour ago
 I literally can barely last a day away from [[k0sh3k]], I'm that psychologically and physiologically dependent upon her.

Once again the being busy has been useful in that I haven't had time to miss Adam too badly. But I can definitely tell I'm more emotionally constipated than usual without him to process things with. Today is slower so I'm really starting to feel the effects of being away from him for so long now. 

And yes, I am going to need SO. MUCH. ME. TIME... Emoji image of 'joy'Emoji image of 'joy' I'll have to lock myself in a room and just do a million sudokus til I feel normal again.

 lol

 I hope you are writing about your experience.
a day ago
 if and when you have the time and energy*
a day ago
 It will be useful for you when you go to think about the experience later.
a day ago
 And, it may help you process it real time a bit.

 I will be interested to know what you see in this season of life when you've had the chance to digest it.
a day ago
 I'm sorry you are in the whirlwind! I will be listening.</code></pre></div>
