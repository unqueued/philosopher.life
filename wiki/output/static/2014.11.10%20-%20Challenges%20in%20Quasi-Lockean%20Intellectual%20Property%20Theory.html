<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Intellectual property (IP) rights are an increasingly vital area of philosophical inquiry in a global society dependent on information and intellectual labor. This paper investigates the challenges faced by a quasi-Lockean IP theory used to determine, explain, and justify moral, private IP rights. The status quo of legal IP rights, or something quite like it, is sometimes defended on quasi-Lockean moral grounds. This paper describes significant challenges for such an account, and provides reasons to think the status quo of IP rights, or similar states of affairs, may not be justified on Lockean grounds. </p><p>I begin this paper by providing context and laying some groundwork to show where this extended IP theory is positioned in a general landscape of property concepts and theories. We will consider the basic and foundational quasi-Lockean theory for physical property and examine the standard Lockean IP extension built on top of that foundation. From there, I will offer a series of objections to this extension. In particular, I disagree with Lockean IP theorists about the targets of IP rights, the need for a property theory regarding non-rivalrous objects, the coherence and viability of rules and mechanics for IP acquisition, and the soundness of domain selection for IP rights. The standard quasi-Lockean IP theory may lack the explanatory qualities we should require for agreeing to the limitations on our freedom that it would impose. Ultimately, I advocate a non-interference right rather than private IP rights. In considering an alternative view, I will explore the possibility that discussions of IP have been too narrow and offer possible exceptions to this right of non-interference.</p><h3 class=""><strong>Groundwork Property Concepts and Narrowing Our Focus</strong></h3><p>IP is a hotly contested topic in philosophy, law, political science, library science, and other disciplines as well. Generally, the topic of IP is approached as a set of legal rights resulting from laws constructed by a legal system. Naturally, philosophical discussions of IP tend to revolve around political philosophy more so than ordinary moral philosophy. Granted, even in these discussions, IP laws are often justified on moral grounds. The normative force of an IP right generated by positive laws, however, isn‚Äôt necessarily based solely on moral grounds. Further, the construction of positive laws may often require certain kinds of pragmatic sacrifices which moral laws need not make. Depending on how we approach these issues, positive and moral laws can differ widely in many respects, and IP is no exception. </p><p>This paper will focus on a modern quasi-Lockean framework for moral IP rights employed to justify and maintain the status quo of legal IP rights (or something similar) found in many Anglo-American nations.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> Before we dive in, we need to lay a basic groundwork. The topic of property is plagued with problems of definitions and challenging conceptual analysis, and we should briefly consider what we mean by property right. </p><p>Generally, a property right is a bundled set of rights for some set of people concerning the access, use, or control of some set of objects. The origins of these rights are usually a set of rules (positive laws, moral laws, etc.). These rules bind a certain society or population. Property rules generate property claim rights for some set of people and corresponding obligations toward the rights-holder(s) regarding that property for another set of people. There are different classes of property rules and rights, including private, common, and collective. We will focus on private property.</p><p>Private property rights are often what we have in mind when we think of property rights. Broadly, some private entity (an individual or corporation) has some set of rights to access, use, or control some set of objects. The bundles of control, access, and use rights tend to clump together with a similar scope for private property rights. To a significant extent, the control over private property belongs to the private property rights-holders.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> Of course, private property rights don‚Äôt necessarily have to include absolute control over some set of objects.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> </p><p>Legions of philosophical perspectives surround the theory and practice of property rules and rights. The view I will dissect in this paper aims at moral, private IP rules and rights. This narrows the discussion considerably, since much of the literature on property focuses either on a legal realm or on traditional objects of property rights (e.g. land and other strictly physical objects). In this paper, we will see a tension between proponents of private IP rights and what I believe is the more intuitive and defensible position: a non-interference right which enables us to use our minds as we see fit.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button></p><p>There are different kinds of philosophical accounts and justifications for the lineage and development of moral, private IP rules and rights. Outside of Hegelian accounts, we generally hear two kinds of arguments today in favor of moral IP rights: utilitarian arguments concerning incentives and quasi-Lockean stories involving entitlement to the fruits of intellectual labor. </p><p>As we shall see, Lockean IP theorists need a convincing story which explains the metaphysical and physical relationships between objects and owners. In contrast, utilitarians don‚Äôt necessarily need to provide that sort of story. Utilitarianism can demand national holidays for Cthulhu or require other ostensibly bogus obligations or rules, and that would be fine if it maximized utility. Utilitarians need to tell us a potent epistemic story. Lockean theorists, however, need to present us a potent ontic story.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> Many of us may already buy the Lockean ontic story for the usual sorts of private physical property, but it is unclear whether a clean, relevant, and comprehensive ontic story can be told for intellectual property.</p><p>We will focus on a modern, quasi-Lockean perspective.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button> The basic quasi-Lockean story for private physical property seems to have the ring of truth to it for most people. At least for physical objects, this account sketches a genealogical distribution and justificatory story which many of us take for granted. That foundational story, on which the IP story is built or extended, goes approximately like this:</p><p>Objects generally start out as being unowned, with the exception that we own ourselves to some significant extent. We have a basis for thinking that objects (since we are objects) can be owned. Further, we have practical reasons and needs for the use of resources and objects. Many objects are finite, and we assume there must be moral rules which govern how these unowned objects are appropriated and/or distributed.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> </p><p>Barring some set of conditions, when someone becomes the first to occupy or fittingly mix his labor with some unowned object, many of us have the intuition that he appropriates that object.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button> Roughly, he appropriates this object because he owns himself and his labor, and therefore he is entitled to the suitable fruits of his labor. In particular, his entitlement to the fruits of his labor only applies to labor upon objects he already owned, or unowned objects.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button> Somehow, his labor imbues an object, perhaps becomes part of that object (or the object becomes an extension of his identity), and since he owns his labor, he appropriates the object. Exactly how this plays out is not clear. There could be many ways to explain this particular part of the story.</p><p>What we have here, then, is some set of moral rules which we believe generate some set of private property rights for him with regards to the object he appropriates. Unless there are some intervening reasons or moral obligations, he will have a bundle of moral, private property rights to that object. Applying this process over and over, and in conjunction with the valid transfer of acquired properties (consensual trading, selling, giving, bequeathing, etc.), we see the skeleton of a broad genealogical picture of moral, private property rights and a basic justification.</p><p>There are many objections one might raise to this Lockean story, particularly regarding labor mixing. The notion of imbuing unowned objects might sound mystical to certain folks. Further, it isn‚Äôt clear precisely what rights resulting from mixing one‚Äôs labor ought to be included in the overall bundle. However, I‚Äôm not trying to debate the merits of this foundational, unextended quasi-Lockean perspective for physical objects. Many people at least see some merit in the notion that we own the fruits of our labor to a large extent. There seems to be a common sense notion that when you chop down an unowned tree and build a chair from it, you own that chair. Let‚Äôs assume the story works.</p><p>The quasi-Lockean IP theorist claims we can extend this basic theory for physical objects to intellectual objects. Can and should this story be extended to include intellectual property? Intellectual labor is a kind of labor, after all. At the very least, you surely own your thoughts, which is a kind of fruit of your intellectual labor. What other possible products of intellectual labor are you justified in morally, privately owning?</p><h3 class=""><strong>Extending the Physical Property Framework for Intellectual Objects and Labor</strong></h3><p>As far as I can tell, there isn‚Äôt a thorough, well-articulated, soup-to-nuts account of the IP extension of the Lockean physical property theory. What I have found is a loose collection of generally agreed upon assumptions and claims surrounding a sketch of an extended ontic story.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button> It seems many IP theorists take such an account for granted and work from these assumptions; they are more likely interested in broader issues and questions which arise from or before such an account rather than the mechanics and internals of the account itself. That‚Äôs fair, though, since we have to start somewhere in the dialectic. What follows is my attempt to charitably construct an outline of this standard account. I will eventually argue that when we take a closer look under the hood, such an account is unintuitive and lacking in explanatory power, but I want to do my best to present their case.</p><p>For the standard Lockean IP extension, a litany of activities is thought to fall under the umbrella of intellectual labor, including inventing, innovating, writing, recording, systematizing, creating, and discovering. What are the fruits of intellectual labor? Beyond our mere thoughts and the physical objects we create, the standard answer is some sort of abstract idea, a metaphysical object or entity, often referred to as an intellectual object. </p><p>We are forced to ask, then, what is an intellectual object? This is a tricky question, and the standard approach generally tries to evade talking about the critical metaphysics underpinning an answer. We seem to assume some robust sort of metaphysics in asserting the existence of these intellectual objects, although it doesn‚Äôt have to extend all the way to an extreme framework like Platonism.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button> The answer to this question is not clear, and that‚Äôs okay. It may be difficult to defend a robust, systematic position in metaphysics (especially if you focus on ethics and political philosophy). The standard approach jumps ahead and answers a different question: What objects are the IP rights targeting? If we can answer this question, perhaps we can begin to clarify the fruits of our intellectual labor.</p><p>There seem to be two paths one could take. One path, the intellectual object thesis, is the claim that an IP rights-holder has a bundle of property rights targeting the intellectual object which has been created or discovered. This path entails the possibility that metaphysical entities or artifacts can be owned; they are themselves the targets of IP rights. The other path, the manifestations thesis, is the claim that an IP rights-holder has a bundle of rights concerning the use and distribution of humanly-made physical manifestations or expressions of an intellectual object. On this view, IP rights target the physical instantiations of intellectual objects, not the intellectual objects themselves. </p><p>If the Lockean IP extension is built on the intellectual object thesis, it has a targeting mechanism quite similar to the underlying physical theory. Essentially, the fruits of intellectual labor are intellectual objects, and those objects are the targets of IP rights. The initial difference between this version of the extension and the underlying account can be found in what type of objects are targeted by the property rights. Directly owning metaphysical entities, like intellectual objects, is a significant departure from the physical theory. The targeting principles of this extended theory seem to parallel the unextended account, but the ontic story may be a bit different and more complicated because the type of object targeted is so dissimilar.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the IP extension is built on the manifestation thesis, it does not depart from the unextended account in terms of the type of object targeted by property rights. Property rights from both this extension and the underlying theory exclusively target physical objects. The manifestation thesis based extension radically departs from the unextended theory in the targeting mechanism. </p><p>For unextended physical property rights, the object with which you mix your labor is what you directly own. According to an extension built on the manifestation thesis, however, you don‚Äôt own what you‚Äôve created or discovered precisely, which in part is thought to be the intellectual object; rather, you have property rights to the corresponding humanly-made physical manifestations of that intellectual object.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button> As Adam Moore explains it:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Rights do not surround the abstract non-physical entity, or res, of intellectual property; rather, intellectual property rights surround the control of physical manifestations or expressions‚Ä¶ Intellectual property rights are rights that surround control of the physical manifestations or tokens of ideas.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">13</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>This shift in targets may not be without reason. First, dealing with physical manifestations has far less mystique about it. This shift in targets grounds the discussion for folks who want as little do with metaphysics as possible. Secondly, when it comes to enforcement (which isn‚Äôt necessarily something a moral theory has to be concerned with), it may be more practical to target the physical instantiations. Lastly, some people might be persuaded by this case: if an intellectual object were directly owned by someone else, then I might be violating his rights simply by thinking about that object. This would be intolerable to many of our intuitions, and might lead someone to say the intellectual object isn‚Äôt directly owned, but rather the physical objects corresponding to it are the targets of IP rights.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">14</sup></button> </p><p>What it means to create a physical manifestation of an intellectual object can be non-obvious. Here is a fairly straightforward example: when you compose your own piece of music, you have created or discovered some intellectual object specifying a series of sound waves. The abstract specification or represented configuration of sounds waves is the intellectual object you‚Äôve created or discovered.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">15</sup></button> The corresponding .flac file on your hard drive is a physical expression of that intellectual object. If I were to code, record, compose, or copy a representation of that precise series of sound waves onto a CD, I would have created a physical manifestation of the intellectual object you labored to create or discover.</p><p>Given the extension built using the intellectual object thesis, you own the intellectual object directly. That specification of sound waves is yours. I‚Äôve violated your IP rights by not getting your consent to use your intellectual object. On the extension built on the manifestations thesis, however, you own the physical manifestations, including the CD I burned. Presumably, if you had IP rights surrounding the physical manifestations of that intellectual object, then I‚Äôve trampled on them. </p><p>What if I created an adjusted manifestation, whereby I changed just a tiny bit of one of the sound waves? Overwhelmingly, and regardless of which thesis is selected for the extension, IP theorists believe I‚Äôm still violating your rights. My adjusted manifestation is considered a derivative of your work. That my manifestation was similar enough to your manifestation or the corresponding intellectual object is sufficient for claiming I‚Äôve violated your IP rights. </p><p>We can flesh out this view in at least two ways. It is possible that when you create or discover an intellectual object, you‚Äôve really created or discovered a family of them which are sufficiently similar. Every manifestation would then directly correspond to some mirror-image intellectual object. The intellectual object thesis might lean in this direction. Another possibility is that you‚Äôve only created or discovered a single intellectual object, but there are families of manifestations similar enough to the original, mirror-image manifestation.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">16</sup></button> The manifestations thesis may be in a better position to adopt this view.</p><p>Eventually, however, there comes a point where I have made so many adjustments to the series of sound waves that I have a different song entirely, and, essentially, an intellectual object which you didn‚Äôt create or discover. </p><p>While unstated, it may be assumed that intellectual property rights do not exist until there is some kind of humanly-made physical manifestation of the intellectual object. Presumably, this is for a practical reason: how else would we know someone had come up with or discovered an intellectual object? Technically, however, a moral theory isn‚Äôt conceptually bound to such practicalities.</p><p>Vitally, and regardless of the thesis selection, IP theorists believe the domain of protected objects is a limited subset of all intellectual objects. This domain is comprised almost entirely of works of copyright, patents, trade secrets, and trademarks. Each subdomain is generally associated with a different bundle of rights.</p><p>Those are the essential background points. There are numerous other factors and possibilities we could take into account. For example, some Lockean IP theorists may wrestle with possible proviso considerations, such as a spoilage or waste proviso, a charity proviso for those in extreme need, or the standard ‚Äúenough, and as good left for others‚Äù sufficiency proviso.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">17</sup></button> Other theorists may appeal to a more strictly historical Lockean perspective, attempting to ensure supreme and detailed compatibility between historical Lockean theory and an IP extension.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">18</sup></button> I‚Äôve set aside these kinds of considerations since I‚Äôm simply after the core and most widely accepted stance.</p><p>Given this standard background, the story of this quasi-Lockean IP extension for intellectual objects and labor goes something like this:</p><p>Someone intellectually labors; she creates or discovers a previously non-existing or undiscovered intellectual object. If the intellectual object falls into one of the protected subdomains, then either the humanly-made physical manifestations of that intellectual object are candidates for IP protection (manifestations thesis) or the intellectual object is a candidate for IP protection (intellectual object thesis). Using the manifestations thesis, the current and future humanly-made physical manifestations of that intellectual object will be the targets of her IP rights. Using the intellectual object thesis, her IP rights will target the intellectual object.</p><p>Since she owns herself, and she owns her labor, including her intellectual labor, then she will appropriate either the intellectual object or the humanly-made physical manifestations corresponding to the intellectual object she intellectually labored to create or discover. </p><p>Barring some set of conditions or intervening moral obligations (presumably analogous to the unextended physical property theory), she will have a bundle of private, moral IP rights to either the intellectual object or the physical manifestations of this intellectual object, wherein the exact bundle is specific to the subdomain of the intellectual object. This bundle includes property rights to derivatives. </p><p>At first glance, this seems like a reasonable story and a fairly appropriate extension of the Lockean theory for physical property rights. Many people seem to buy it. Creators or discoverers of intellectual objects are compensated for their intellectual labor. It feels like justice has been served when that occurs. While that is alluring, we must ask: Does this IP story work? Does it satisfactorily extend the initial physical theory? Do we need this theory? </p><p>Almost everyone would agree that when you chop down an unowned tree and build a chair from it, you own that chair. IP stories, however, don‚Äôt seem as intuitive as this chair story because there are significant differences, glitches, and gaps. The rest of this paper is devoted to examining problems with this sketch and considering the space of arguments and dialectical moves available to the quasi-Lockean IP theorist to rebut these challenges. </p><h3 class=""><strong>Non-Rivalrousness and the Manifestations Thesis</strong></h3><p>There seem to be at least two exceptionally compelling and intertwined reasons for wanting moral, private property rules and rights.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">19</sup></button> First, many vital resources are finite, and we want a moral framework to account for fair and legitimate appropriation and private ownership of those scarce resources.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">20</sup></button> Second, barring some intervening considerations, you should own the fruits of your labor, lest society verge on mass theft and possibly some form of slavery.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">21</sup></button>
 
Generally, for physical objects and properties, both reasons matter. However, it is not clear that both reasons are relevant enough to intellectual objects and labor to result in IP rules and rights. In particular, intellectual objects are widely considered non-rivalrous. I can use an intellectual object (e.g. thinking about it or creating a physical manifestation of it) without directly impairing anyone else‚Äôs ability to use that intellectual object. </p><p>An intellectual object can‚Äôt be consumed or destroyed. We can all simultaneously use it. Unless we have really good reasons showing otherwise, shouldn‚Äôt everyone have fair and complete access to non-rivalrous objects? Do we need a private property theory for non-rivalrous objects? It doesn‚Äôt seem like we do. </p><p>Consider the number 2. This is an intellectual object. We can‚Äôt consume or destroy it. We can all simultaneously use it. We can all think about it at the same time. We can all concurrently create physical expressions of it by writing the numeral down on a page. We can all employ it in counting our thumbs without impairing each other. Like all other intellectual objects, its consumption is non-rivalrous. It is radically different from any physical object, since only a finite set of people can use a physical object in any given period of time.  The number 2, unlike physical objects, is available to everyone for all time.</p><p>At least to my intuitions, the obvious starting place for non-rivalrous objects, such as intellectual objects, would be no property rights, or perhaps a general right to non-interference concerning the access and use of those non-rivalrous objects.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">22</sup></button> Fair and unlimited use is always possible. We need fantastic reasons to justify limiting the initial freedoms of people, and it isn‚Äôt easy to see why we need to put restrictions on the use of and access to non-rivalrous objects.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">23</sup></button> </p><p>I am not claiming that IP rights are irreversibly or conceptually illegitimate because intellectual objects are non-rivalrous.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">24</sup></button> But, if we take up the intellectual object thesis, then we go back to the initial problem with the private ownership of non-rivalrous objects. The burden of proof is on the IP theorist to demonstrate how and why a non-rivalrous object could be privately owned to any degree.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">26</sup></button>
 
Perhaps the claim that laborers are entitled to the appropriate fruits of their labor might justify the private ownership of these non-rivalrous objects. If so, then it is up to the IP theorist to demonstrate why the reasons for entitlement are so potent they override our initial non-interference rights to non-rivalrous intellectual objects, enabling the private ownership of these non-rivalrous objects via intellectual labor mixing. </p><p>It makes sense why we want a property theory for being entitled to the fruits of our labor regarding rivalrous objects. When someone steals the taco salad I‚Äôve made, they‚Äôve stolen my labor. In contrast, when someone builds an identical taco salad after watching me build my mine, I still have my taco salad. My labor hasn‚Äôt been stolen from me. Maybe building his taco salad was easier for him, but so what? I could have just kept my taco salad, construction techniques, and recipe a secret, but I didn‚Äôt. In this situation, where has the theft occurred? More importantly, it isn‚Äôt clear why I should own a non-rivalrous object such as the intellectual object of a taco salad. We need reasons to justify a property theory for objects which don‚Äôt intuitively seem to need one.</p><h3 class=""><strong>Unexplained Intellectual Objects, Derivatives, and Mechanics of Appropriation</strong></h3><p>Since the IP theorist cannot or should not employ the manifestations thesis, then he must instead argue that one owns intellectual objects themselves. Justifying the private ownership of non-rivalrous objects alone is an uphill battle. However, a Lockean account of IP is open to a network of other challenges as well. There are significant gaps to the operation of this ontic story which need to be explained because limiting our freedoms via private IP rights requires a worthy and comprehensive justification.</p><p>The standard account generally doesn‚Äôt specify many elements of the metaphysics in the ontic story. I sympathize with the desire to minimize the reliance upon metaphysics, but it seems reasonable to ask for a clearer account of the nature of intellectual objects and how the process of appropriation of these abstract objects functions. </p><p>The fact is that intellectual objects are less understood than, and very different from, trees and chairs.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">27</sup></button> To arrive at private IP rights, a significant amount of work needs to be done to show how the analogy between the physical and the intellectual or abstract honestly holds, but that requires understanding the nature of intellectual objects and how ownership could possibly operate in the first place.</p><p>We don‚Äôt know if an intellectual object is actually a single intellectual object or if it is really a collection of many intellectual objects. We don‚Äôt know how intellectual objects relate to each other, either. It is unclear where derivatives end and original works begin. We don‚Äôt know how or why to draw lines of similarity and define derivatives. </p><p>Science provides us a clean causal story for physical objects, and the unextended Lockean theory seems to add only a pinch of metaphysics to the ontic story. Lockean IP stories, by comparison, aren‚Äôt as clear (perhaps unacceptably so). Intellectual objects don‚Äôt have a nice timeline; we are much less capable of understanding their beginnings and ends. We might not even know precisely on what we intellectually labor. We have a fairly clean ontic story for physical objects and property, in which we work on unowned physical objects or objects we already own. We don‚Äôt have a similarly clean story for intellectual objects and labor. </p><p>We can‚Äôt just bypass or merely guess at how these concerns work out. It is crucial to have some understanding of these sorts of issues in order to justify and know our various IP rights and obligations. The IP theorist needs to show he isn‚Äôt making it up as he goes; we need to see why the practical IP rules he enshrines aren‚Äôt arbitrary.</p><p>We need to know what counts as violating IP rights. For example, duplicating a modern Mona Lisa is a violation, but it isn‚Äôt clear if duplicating just a quadrant of the Mona Lisa is a violation (or why). It isn‚Äôt clear what principle we would use to determine how many particles must be duplicated or unaltered before a tribute to the Mona Lisa is a violation. </p><p>Similarly, from our music example: at some point, I can speed up your song enough that it is a new intellectual object. We don‚Äôt know how much I need to speed up the song before it is no longer under your umbrella of protections. What rule governs this distinction? Further, we don‚Äôt really know why it is acceptable for me to play 5 seconds of your song on the radio without your consent, but not 50 seconds.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">28</sup></button> For whatever rule we might use, it is hard to see how the rule itself could be defended on strictly Lockean grounds.</p><p>Unfortunately, IP rules and rights tend to generate conflicting intuitions all the time. Consider a case in which I‚Äôve removed 50% of the sound waves from the original piece of music; surely that isn‚Äôt a protected derivative. Precisely how much is necessary to remove in order to avoid generating a derivative is another issue, but let‚Äôs assume 50% is fine. What if I‚Äôve removed 50% of the sound waves, but none of the removed sound waves were in the range of frequencies which humans can hear? Or, consider the fact that our auditory systems are scientifically known to play tricks on us (filling in the gaps); what if I made radical alterations to the sound waves (producing many gaps), but humans couldn‚Äôt sense the difference? Suddenly, many IP theorists would be inclined to go the other direction and claim infringement. We need good rules that draw bright lines to answer these questions.</p><p>If you make a detailed mural on a wall, and I duplicate it in a tiny bitmap image, I‚Äôm still thought to be violating your rights. Lossy-compressed works of art are still derivatives of the original. Is there a point at which I‚Äôve made such a tiny, compressed image of your mural that it is no longer considered a violation of your rights? I don‚Äôt know how or why we can draw that line. It can go the other direction too. If I make a tiny bitmap image first, and then you make a detailed mural on a wall which just ‚Äúfills out‚Äù the details, you seem to be violating my supposed rights. Why and how?</p><p>IP theorists accept that computer generated objects are protectable under IP rules. This is interesting because it allows for a brute force thought experiment which applies to most kinds of IP. For example, it is extremely common for images and music to be computer generated today. What if I systematically create all possible previously unowned pieces of music and image bitmaps on a supercomputer?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">29</sup></button> It seems like I would have an incredibly extensive set of IP rights. Anyone making any sort of music or image would be violating my IP rights. This is intolerable to the intuitions of most IP theorists, but they have to give reasons why I wouldn‚Äôt have appropriated all of these corresponding intellectual objects.</p><p>Consider a case in which you invent the combustion engine, a 2-stroke engine which can only use 91 octane gasoline as fuel. Do you have an IP right to the very general notion of a combustion engine or only a specific kind? To some intuitions, it would seem like I‚Äôm still violating your IP rights if I build an almost identical combustion engine which can only use 85 octane gasoline as fuel. What if I built a 4-stroke engine? What if I built a similar engine for diesel or even a non-petroleum fuel altogether? It is unclear when progress in the arena of engines is no longer a violation of your IP rights, but rather something counted as my invention. An effective IP theory requires justified principles or rules which draw these sorts of lines.</p><p>Or consider the case of the wrap dress. Diane von F√ºrstenberg designed the wrap dress in 1974. Despite the fact that von F√ºrstenberg is still living and still designing fabulous clothes, the wrap dress pattern, an intellectual object, is not considered to be her IP ‚Äì anyone is free to buy a knock-off version or create their own. Why isn‚Äôt that intellectual object protected like other sorts of designs? It isn‚Äôt clear why F√ºrstenberg hasn‚Äôt acquired IP rights in these cases, and why these knock-offs, which appear to be derivatives of F√ºrstenberg wrap dresses, aren‚Äôt considered actual derivatives or duplicates.
  
As far as I can tell, all intellectual properties have these sorts of problems. These cases demonstrate how our understanding of intellectual objects and derivatives is filled with guesswork. My gut instinct is to claim derivatives are actually different intellectual objects entirely, and if the Lockean IP theory works at all, it should only grant IP rights to the original, but none of the derivatives.</p><p>If we don‚Äôt have effective reasons to include derivative objects under the umbrella protections of the original intellectual object, then all that is left are ownership rights to the original intellectual object. Depending on how detailed we take an intellectual object to be, that could mean IP rights are much slimmer than we thought. If these objects are detailed enough, it is possible that only one physical expression could correspond to an intellectual object, but then, by definition, no duplicate would really correspond to the intellectual object.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">30</sup></button> Defending derivatives is likely crucial to the IP theorist‚Äôs view, but it is not obvious why we should buy into the notion that there are derivatives.</p><p>Even if we were to get past some of these line-drawing metaphysical problems, the actual mechanics of appropriation and the resulting IP rights aren‚Äôt clear, either. For example, what if multiple people independently create/discover an intellectual object?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">31</sup></button>  Many timeframe and epistemic issues arise from this which fuzzes our understanding of IP rights and appropriation. </p><p>If I‚Äôm the first person to create or discover an intellectual object, then supposedly I‚Äôm the owner. It is quite unclear why my creating or discovering an intellectual object at some point in time and place should result in rights which have anything to do with your independently creating or discovering the same intellectual object at some other point in time and place. An IP theorist could claim that we both somehow deserve shared IP rights, although it isn‚Äôt clear what those rights should look like (nor how we might know there was another creator/discoverer who also had shared rights). </p><p>There are also many categories of intellectual progress which require stepping-stones to advance. Consider a case in which I‚Äôm inventing the car. It seems like I‚Äôm relying upon numerous other intellectual objects which I don‚Äôt own. I‚Äôm standing on the shoulders of giants.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">32</sup></button> Am I allowed to invent the car if you own the wheel? Even if I can invent it, why would I own it? Almost any creation or discovery of an intellectual object relies upon a web of other intellectual objects (which supposedly may be owned). It is not clear if such creations or discoveries should result in IP rights, and even if they did, it is unclear what the bundles of IP rights should be, how they are distributed, and why. </p><p>Further, is it enough that I simply dreamt up the basic notion of a car in order for me to own that intellectual object?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">33</sup></button> That might not be enough. How much of the schematic do I need to have generated before I‚Äôve really created or discovered the car? It would seem odd to require a working prototype; many patents are granted without one.  We need to know how much and precisely what kind of labor is necessary and sufficient for acquiring an intellectual object.</p><p>For example, a nature photojournalist, David Slater, was in Indonesia when a Macara nigra monkey swiped David‚Äôs camera and took a famous selfie.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">34</sup></button> Who has the IP rights to this photograph? Some people think Slater performed an appropriate kind and amount of work to have acquired the rights simply by venturing into the jungle of Indonesia, taking pictures, and accidentally earning this prize experience. Others think his luck just isn‚Äôt sufficient; after all, David didn‚Äôt take the picture, the monkey did. At what point does intellectual intent (rather than mere accident) play a role in intellectual labor mixing? The IP theorist has to provide a theory comprehensive enough to draw the appropriate line and justify it.</p><p>These are some of the many gaps in the ontic story which the quasi-Lockean IP theorist needs to fill in order for us to even understand what it means to be entitled to the fruits of intellectual labor. Without knowing what it really means to be entitled to the fruits of intellectual labor at this practical level, it is hard to see why we should agree there is any entitlement.</p><h3 class=""><strong>Unexplained Domains of Protected Intellectual Objects</strong></h3><p>Not all intellectual objects fall into the domains protected by IP. These kinds of domains are generally codified in Anglo-American laws, but they also happen to be, by and large, what IP theorists are trying to defend and justify.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">35</sup></button> Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt clear how to provide strictly Lockean arguments in favor of these particular domains and their various quirks. </p><p>The different domains of IP each come with a different bundle of rights. For example, a copyright is associated with rights and obligations quite different from trade secrets or patents. In a utilitarian theory, we might be able to provide significantly dissimilar utility stories for intellectual objects divided into domains of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents; hence the differences in the bundles of rights associated with these domains might be justified. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt clear how the differences in the domain-specific bundles of rights can be justified on exclusively quasi-Lockean grounds. Additionally, this may be a disanalogy with the unextended physical property theory where, unlike the IP extension, instances of private appropriation of physical objects generally result in a highly similar kind of bundles of rights.</p><p>These domains are accompanied by some odd bundles of rights which aren‚Äôt easily explained. There is a tradition of upheaval precisely at the point of identifying which bundle of rights is awarded for each domain; IP theorists and practitioners disagree on the correct bundles. A copyright, for example, hasn‚Äôt always been a lifetime property right (alternatively, some copyrights only extend for a certain number of years beyond the life of an author), nor is it necessarily a kind of property right which can be transferred to others indefinitely.  That you own something only for a limited period of time, and that you have impaired or limited control rights is odd. If there are Lockean IP rights, why would the ownership durations and control rights of these properties vary? It requires an explanation. We can justify these quirks with incentives-based utilitarian reasons for creative expression, but it isn‚Äôt clear how the strictly Lockean IP theorist can defend such quirky limitations on bundles of private property rights. </p><p>Consider patents, which award a powerful monopoly over all expressions and implementations of an intellectual object for decades. Eligibility for the bundle of rights afforded by patent protection requires non-obvious novelty and usefulness. Maybe we can quickly defend novelty in terms of differentiating intellectual objects and ensuring a new intellectual object has actually been created or discovered.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">36</sup></button> What rule draws the lines for usefulness and non-obviousness, and why should we agree to it? Even if we could provide this on Lockean grounds, we also need reasons why usefulness and non-obviousness are necessary for these IP rights. </p><p>Trade secrets can have quirky bundles of rights, as well. For example, trade secret rights lapse when the owner communicates the secret to the public. But why should that communication matter? I can‚Äôt think of another kind of property in which my telling you about my property results in the lapse of my ownership rights to it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">37</sup></button>  We can see the word ‚Äúsecret‚Äù is in the name of this domain, but the Lockean IP theorist has to give us reasons why concealment could be so crucial for having and maintaining an IP right in the first place. </p><p>I have sympathy for trade secrets. For any intellectual object which I alone know about, there is a natural pseudo-monopoly to that intellectual object. If I discover the recipe to the greatest hot sauce of all time, and I only make it for myself, and I never allow others to know about it, then it seems to result in something like an IP right. It would be immoral to torture me to release my secret information or to hack into my computer for my secret recipe.  Of course, the wrongness of these acts has little or, indeed, nothing to do with violating my supposed IP right. This natural pseudo-monopoly doesn‚Äôt need to be explained in terms of a real property right. If you aren‚Äôt precluded from figuring out the recipe for yourself and making your own hot sauce, then my secret is just a secret, and not obviously an IP right. An IP right should preclude you from discovering the recipe and making your own hot sauce. It isn‚Äôt clear why, on Lockean grounds, a trade secret should result in an IP right rather than just a natural pseudo-monopoly.</p><p>Trademarks are no exception to this unexplained quirkiness either. Trademarks are restricted by common, everyday language. You can‚Äôt own a word or symbol (or any other object which communicates semantics) which is an ordinary expression. What rule defines ordinary everydayness? What if trademarked words or symbols become ordinary expressions? We need clear rules and, vitally, justifications for those rules. While I can see how the utilitarian position might explain and justify these issues, I don‚Äôt see how the Lockean position can.</p><p>Admittedly, I am very sympathetic to the notion that people are morally obligated not to lie about who they are or who produced a product in the vast majority of circumstances. For example, I wouldn‚Äôt want Blackwater Security Consulting masquerading as UNICEF or the Red Cross since BSC and its various agents, services, and products don‚Äôt deserve the kind of respect or trust earned by entities like UNICEF and the RC. At first glance, that does seem like a trademark issue. These kinds of obligations not to deceive, however, aren‚Äôt necessarily tied to intellectual labor-mixing or anything which the Lockean IP extension provides.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">38</sup></button> We can give other moral reasons not to deceive. </p><p>Going back to the painting example, if we replace the painting with some other object, let‚Äôs say a chair (which also has a corresponding intellectual object), the IP theorist would surely claim no theft has occurred when I duplicate your chair. The chair could be a piece of art and/or an invention (I suppose it could technically fit any of the domains), but the IP theorist doesn‚Äôt think it can be covered by either copyright or patent protections (even if you were the first person to create a chair or a chair like that one). Why is the intellectual object corresponding to the physical painting ownable, but not the intellectual object corresponding to the physical chair? We can fabricate a utilitarian argument for this difference, but it is not obvious how the quasi-Lockean IP theorist can offer an effective argument for why certain intellectual objects which initially appear to fall under the protected domains end up not being protected. </p><p>More problematic, and broader as well, the IP theorist needs to give a clear and effective argument for why only certain domains of intellectual objects are protected in the first place. This division needs an explanation; else the targets of IP protection seem arbitrary. What is the domain creating rule?  Why should only certain kinds of fruits of intellectual labor be open to ownership? These domains which are assumed to be protected require justifications.</p><p>I worry the quasi-Lockean IP theorist is forced to inject utilitarian justifications into his argument. In most IP discussions, this is generally how the domains are justified. I‚Äôm not against a mixed-method approach to justifying IP rights. The problem, however, is that this injection sullies the Lockean approach. The Lockean approach is interested in applying principles of justice, not utilitarian distributions. Once you bite the bullet in employing utilitarian justifications, why not stick to utilitarian arguments for IP? So many problems disappear when you do that.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">39</sup></button> I‚Äôm going to set this aside since I‚Äôm investigating the merits of a purely quasi-Lockean account. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt see how this justificatory and line-drawing work can be accomplished without utilitarian reasons.</p><p>There may be strictly Lockean paths for justifying domains, but they aren‚Äôt easy to provide. Consider the domains of mathematical equations, numbers, and other logical intellectual objects. These domains of intellectual objects are resoundingly rejected as being ownable. Why is that? It is common sense to us, but we need reasons for why numbers and equations don‚Äôt fall into the domains of privately ownable intellectual objects if there are somehow other intellectual objects which can be privately owned. </p><p>The Lockean IP theorist may respond that these intellectual objects predate us.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">40</sup></button> We merely discover them. One path available to the Lockean IP theorist is to claim intellectual objects like numbers and equations can‚Äôt be owned because they are discovered and aren‚Äôt created. Between the intellectual objects corresponding to a painting and a number or equation, it seems somewhat plausible to think that the painting‚Äôs intellectual object is created while the number or equation is discovered. Perhaps the distinction between discovered and created intellectual objects is a relevant way to cordon off the privately unownable intellectual objects from the privately ownable. But, even this view may generate conflicting intuitions for the IP theorist.</p><p>There is a world of questions and problems which arise from the philosophies of mathematics, information science, and computer science that bears upon the problem of domains for IP. For example, many assume computer programs are the kind of intellectual objects which can be owned. But, depending on your stances in these philosophies, you may be forced to concede that intellectual objects such as computer programs are mathematical objects. If mathematics can‚Äôt be owned, then computer programs couldn‚Äôt either. A host of similar problems can arise. Justifying boundaries for domains in Lockean IP theory requires an enormous set of controversial views on ontology.</p><p>In any case, an abundance of problems surround the formation and execution of these domains. So much rides on these unanswered issues. If IP theorists can‚Äôt provide a good reason for the domains, then it seems more likely that either all non-rivalrous intellectual objects can be privately owned or none can. Since the Lockean IP theorist already agrees that intellectual objects of most numbers, equations, and the chairs can‚Äôt be privately owned, then none of them can be privately owned on Lockean grounds.</p><h3 class=""><strong>Non-Interference Right and Exceptions</strong></h3><p>I agree we own certain fruits of our intellectual labor. The physical manifestations we create are byproducts of our intellectual labor, and the unextended quasi-Lockean theory for physical objects makes sense of this appropriation. Our thoughts are products of intellectual labor, and we own those (even if we don‚Äôt own the corresponding intellectual objects), and that probably has something to do with self-ownership rights. We don‚Äôt own all the fruits of our intellectual labor, though. I deny that we own the intellectual objects which we create or discover via intellectual labor. </p><p>Private IP rights acquired via labor mixing mistakenly limit our liberty. These obligations prevent us from creating, discovering, learning, experiencing, copying, building upon the work of others, and using our minds in the ways we want to use them. I‚Äôve tried to point out how quasi-Lockean IP theorists haven‚Äôt given us a coherent functional framework of reasons for why and how non-rivalrous objects, particularly intellectual objects, could be owned. Lockean IP theorists haven‚Äôt given us sufficient reasons for restricting individual liberties.</p><p>Along the way, I‚Äôve suggested an alternative view and what I believe is a more plausible starting place for the Lockean. On solely Lockean grounds, we should either deny IP rights altogether or claim a general non-interference right to use and access intellectual objects. I prefer to think of it as a right to non-interference. This view maximizes our personal freedom and protects our self-ownership. </p><p>IP rights are usually thought of as private property rights, and discussions tend reflect a very narrow conception of what counts as an IP right. My claim that we have non-interference rights to access and use intellectual objects doesn‚Äôt fit the normal discourse on the topic. Depending on how we flesh out property rights, it is possible that even the generalized non-interference right to intellectual objects should be classified as a type of IP right, even though it isn‚Äôt anything remotely like the standard, private IP rights we usually talk about. If what we mean by an IP right simply is some sort of right to an intellectual object, then perhaps I‚Äôm arguing for a kind of IP right.</p><p>A non-interference right is basically the claim that it is almost always (given some provisos or constraints) immoral to prevent people from using and accessing intellectual objects. Perhaps we really do have moral duties toward each other to refrain from interfering with how other people use their minds. It‚Äôs a positive thing! Denying any and all IP rights fails to capture this obligation and protection. Hence, I prefer to think of my view as promoting our personal rights rather than denying there are any IP rights at all, because I think we generally have moral obligations not to interfere with how people use their minds and intellectual objects. </p><p>Admittedly, I‚Äôve raised a number of objections to private IP rights in this paper, and we might worry a few of them somehow stick to the non-interference right. I‚Äôm not convinced, however, that a general non-interference right requires we deeply understand the metaphysics behind intellectual objects. Most of the objections I‚Äôve raised just don‚Äôt matter if we aren‚Äôt thinking about private IP rights. Essentially, a non-interference right seems far easier to justify and doesn‚Äôt seem to require nearly as detailed an ontic story as private IP rights.</p><p>Lastly, while I‚Äôve insisted on a non-interference right, it is certainly possible I‚Äôm wrong, or that I‚Äôve overlooked some important exceptions. Perhaps I need to take a step back, since there may be unorthodox cases in which intellectual objects can be privately owned, even if not acquired via labor-mixing. The reasons for the possible private IP rights, however, aren‚Äôt based on Lockean grounds (although these reasons may be compatible with Lockean thought). Again, these unorthodox cases aren‚Äôt usually thought of as being IP rights, but if an IP right is simply a right to an intellectual object, then perhaps these unorthodox cases count.</p><p>In taking a step back from my blanket claim of a non-interference right to intellectual objects, I am also going to push back against an overly narrow understanding of IP rights. Just as a non-interference right might not normally be considered a genuine IP right, the exceptional domains for private IP rights which I have in mind are not usually considered genuine IP domains.
 
Perhaps there are certain intellectual objects which no one should use. Consider a doomsday device which can destroy the universe. Maybe that is the sort of intellectual object for which no one should build physical manifestations or even schematics. Presumably, we all are morally restricted from using that intellectual object in some ways. At least on some moral theories (which quasi-Lockeans may accept), we might say that my obligation, in this case, corresponds to a claim right each other person has against me not to use the doomsday intellectual object in certain ways (for example, it may violate their self-ownership rights). That seems to be a very specific bundle of ownership rights to the intellectual object, and it seems to be an exception to a non-interference right.</p><p>Maybe only governments and their officials have certain ownership rights to intellectual objects for nuclear weapons. Perhaps nobody except vetted librarians and scientists (for the sake of knowledge alone) should use intellectual objects concerning smallpox. These might be instances of private property rights to intellectual objects, albeit these rights are acquired in odd ways. </p><p>We might interpret certain kinds of personal privacy rights in terms of IP rights. If I had a moral right to have my medical information not used in certain ways by others, then maybe I have a particular kind of IP right. My private data or private intellectual objects are really mine, no matter which server they live on or the paper on which they are recorded. </p><p>Perhaps even censorship, duties against child pornography, and plagiarism can be understood as unique strains of IP rights, even if they aren‚Äôt justified via labor-mixing acquisition. This expansion of what it means to have some bundle of ownership rights to intellectual objects isn‚Äôt well explored. So many rights and obligations we wouldn‚Äôt normally think of as IP rights may actually be IP rights. Depending on how we define property rights, and how we flesh out our various obligations and rights, it is possible that some private IP rights exist.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">41</sup></button></p><p>There may be some moral limitations to how intellectual objects can be used, accessed, or controlled, based on claim rights of specific agents, governments, or corporate entities. If there are cases of private bundles of ownership rights to intellectual objects, they don‚Äôt seem to be due to any sort of labor-mixing acquisition. These rights are likely justified on other moral grounds. I‚Äôm not defending the claim that there are any private IP rights. Assuming the metaphysical framework/story can be structured clearly and reasonably, however, I‚Äôm certainly open to the possibility.</p><p>In any case, these possible exceptions seem to neither demonstrate the viability of the standard quasi-Lockean IP theory, nor interfere with the claim that we all generally have a prima facie non-interference right to use and access intellectual objects. I‚Äôve agreed to the possibility of IP rights, but they are justified on other grounds ‚Äì specifically, non-labor-mixing grounds. From what I can tell, Lockean IP theorists have yet to offer a potent ontic and conceptual tale which would convince us that there are limits on our freedom of use and access to almost all intellectual objects.</p><h3 class=""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Perhaps we can accept some version of the unextended quasi-Lockean theory for physical property rights. There‚Äôs just something about chopping down an unowned tree and building chairs you subsequently come to own which is just common sense.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">42</sup></button> I don‚Äôt see, however, why we should accept the quasi-Lockean IP extension. The standard Lockean IP theory has too many unexplained, and perhaps unexplainable, challenges. We might be able to justify moral, private IP rights connected to intellectual labor via utilitarian or Hegelian accounts, but I don‚Äôt see how an exclusively Lockean account can succeed at this particular goal. </p><p>Essentially, I don‚Äôt think the quasi-Lockean IP theory should be used to justify the status quo of IP rights (or anything like it). It‚Äôs more plausible to think we have a non-interference right to use and access intellectual objects, perhaps with some exceptions for other moral requirements.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> I‚Äôve done my best to extract the core moral arguments from what is traditionally a legal-oriented set of debates concerning IP.

I‚Äôm open to those possibilities, but I just don‚Äôt know for sure.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">20 : </span> I am not claiming that a Lockean theory of property is the ultimate explanation of the morally correct distribution of resources, but it may play a role.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">21 : </span> These considerations need not be a thick set of barriers. There could many moral obligations which are so strong they override most instances of private acquisition or ownership. Interestingly, one strength of the Lockean approach is that almost any theory can accept this acquisition story, as long as certain constraints are met. This is analogous to how many moral theories can accept that certain ethics cases which meet appropriate constraints simply boil down to utility problems as the last deciding factor.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">22 : </span> There are, of course, those who have different intuitions on this matter. Perhaps cultural and generational differences may largely explain the distinct intuitions regarding prima facie rights to non-rivalrous objects. Non-Anglo-American cultures often have strikingly different intuitions on these kinds of matters. Anecdotally, I find many digital natives are more sympathetic to my intuition (granted, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the intuition correct). In either direction, this is an important assumption. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt clear that any answer can be justified via arguments alone. While we may be able to continue asking 'why' into regress, at some point, I think we have to make the pragmatic move of putting our tent pegs down somewhere. I assume this is a fair place to do so. The result is that my argument is weaker for anyone who doesn‚Äôt share my intuition here.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">23 : </span> Technically, even a general non-interference right imposes obligations which limit the freedoms of others. These obligations, however, are generally easy to swallow and aren‚Äôt nearly as imposing as the obligations corresponding to private IP rights. </sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">24 : </span> Himma, Kenneth. <em>Abundance, Rights, and Interests: Thinking about the Legitimacy of Intellectual Property</em>.

I see the problems for the IP extension, however, as being far more difficult to defeat. If Nozick pours his tomato juice in the sea, it doesn‚Äôt result in his acquisition of the sea. But, unlike IP rights, the unextended physical property theory at least has some clear cases which aren‚Äôt ambiguous. The IP theory suffers from far more systematic problems and ambiguities.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">28 : </span> At least on strictly Lockean grounds, the whole legal concept of Fair Use requires a non-utilitarian justification.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">29 : </span> Given sufficiently low requirements, particularly for lossy-compressible objects, this is a very real possibility. It may be easier to understand the bitmap example here, but similar compression and brute-force principles can be applied to sound as well. Further, almost any of kind of intellectual object or domain which the IP theorist wishes to protect may be subject to this sort of brute-force attack. For example, I could try to generate a database of all possible ownable yet unowned strings of English words, and I could copyright and publish each of them individually. Writers would supposedly violate my IP rights all the time in such a case. But, that is intolerable!</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">30 : </span> We also might have a regress of intellectual objects corresponding to other intellectual objects. This is all very messy! I don‚Äôt know the answers to these questions, but they are the kinds of questions for which we need answers in order to effectively justify and elucidate IP rules and rights.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">31 : </span> The controversy of Leibniz and Newton concerning the discovery or creation of calculus is one of many examples. </sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">32 : </span> Almost any modern idea is the result of a massive memetic network.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">33 : </span> Similarly, Jules Verne dreamt up solar sails over a century before a formal, working solar sail was being created.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">34 : </span> Kravets, David.
