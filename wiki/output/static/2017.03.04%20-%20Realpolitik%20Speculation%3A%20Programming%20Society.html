<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>Technology is a double-edged blade. Who wields our greatest technological tools and for what purpose?</em></p><p>We are biological computers living in deeply integrated computer networks and architectures. It's hard to fathom how the pieces fit together. One fact is clear: we are increasingly a data-controlled society. The shadow of Big Brother, a loose agglomeration of many competing national and multi-national political and financial interests, continues to solidify and take root. They wield increasingly sophisticated data-driven weapons against us. Golem is bootstrapping.</p><ul><li>Privately owned and operated institutional AI drives &quot;progress&quot; and herds us together into submissive pawns. </li><li>Credit scores have far less to do with risk assessment and far more to do with generating revolving debt-slaves. </li><li>Long-term computerized record keeping mixed with the inevitability of clandestine interventions, hacks, and blackmarket doxxing removes privacy and pigeon-holes us for life. </li><li>Competitive intelligence distorts markets and creates monopolized playing fields between privatized Big Data and everyone else.</li><li>Filter-bubbles entertain us, blind us, and isolate us. </li><li>Propaganda and mass behavior shaping is increasingly accuratized and weaponized beyond our wildest dreams. You are not immune to psychocyberwarfare, although you delusionally think you aren't even partially a puppet (just like you think advertising has zero effect on you; idiot).</li><li>Computerized &quot;Minority Report&quot; predictions of criminal risk are wielded as profiling and targeting tools which eliminate our autonomy and justify the unequal treatment of people.</li><li>&quot;Citizen Scores&quot; exist in many nations, and their use will become more ubiquitous and profound in shaping every aspect of our lives.</li><li>Fundamental, detailed, deep-learning digested, mass surveillance structures are rising. They are building the prisons around us as we speak. </li></ul><p>We are being remotely controlled bit by bit. It starts indirectly, shallow, hard-to-see, difficult to imagine, and innocuous appearing at first. We are persuaded, gas-lit in an entertaining and self-righteous feeling way, and nudged into the positions set for us by our masters. Technological tendrils and chains penetrate, bind, incapacitate, and manipulate our society. In an oversimplified explanation: those in power pay people to program computers to program us. We are embedded and caught in this ever complexifying feedback loop, a political network of slave-computers.</p><p>Let's be clear: this is not some perfectly choreographed political experience machine. It's deeply chaotic. There are many competing forces. There are many unknowns. Data-controlled societies emerge from the culmination of these many processes through a marriage of purpose and accident. The technopolitical tectonic plates are shifting. Society is in exponential flux. We are politically polarized and fragmented. Who will have the power when the dust settles? As we move towards this technologic Singularity, who will own it? One thing is clear: it won't be &quot;we the people.&quot; Superintelligence is a unique beast, and whoever creates and tames it first will form the new House Targaryen (amplified beyond our imaginations). Power begets power; capital begets capital; information begets information; intelligence begets intelligence; they each beget each other. These powers continue to centralize and are wielded by fewer and fewer people. </p><p>Why should we be subject to their definitions of The Good and The Right? Good and Right 'for whom'? Do you really think they have our best interests at heart? Do you really see philosopher kings and wise statesmen at the controls? Fools. Those in power are psychopaths. The appearance of paternalism is the beginning of slavery. But, eventually, their power will be too intelligently-driven and profound for us to fight back. Our autonomy is dissolving before our eyes, and we will never get it back. Subversion, dissent, counterculture, and freedom-fighting are and will be calculated for and neutralized. Unfortunately, even if we could stop it, we won't. The masses are too illiterate to realize what is happening. Ignorance and malice gel into the slavery-apocalypse. Yo, the end is nigh! </p></div>
