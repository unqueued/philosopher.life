 It goes.  Had a rough week and I am sick now.  Been having some issues sleeping for the past few days due to nose blockages.

 =/
7 hours ago
 Sorry man. That sucks.
7 hours ago
 Yeah that's pretty much my thoughts too.
7 hours ago
 How are you?
7 hours ago
 Disrupting sleep makes life way harder.
7 hours ago
 Been very busy reading and writing.

 my letter to [[AA]] and [[UJ]] is complete. My wife is doing an edit runthrough on the commentary

 What have you been discussing?
7 hours ago
 think you'd find this funny
7 hours ago
 You know what you're right, that is pretty funny.
7 hours ago
 It's just amazing how that works sometimes.
7 hours ago
 From what I can tell it looks like you have been experimenting with encryption on your Wiki.
7 hours ago
 kickscondor and I are having a conversation across our own platforms; I've never had an experience like it

 I encrypted a tiddler
7 hours ago
 I've been ready to do so for over a year
7 hours ago
 installed those addons a long time ago
7 hours ago
 Very nice. I'm glad to see that it is working.
7 hours ago
 my private wiki (where I store resilio sync keys, passwords, addresses, etc.) is encrypted as a whole rather than individual tiddlers
7 hours ago
 I don't like the way individual tiddler encryption operates, since you must literally lock it...I wish it would lock itself
7 hours ago
 I suppose I could spend the time to fix that shit, but I don't want to spend it on that, lol.
7 hours ago
 Oh, I didn't know it work that way. That is good to know I guess. Has there been any progress on the D &amp; D as of late?

 nothing specific, although there was that book I mentioned
7 hours ago
 4th wall ability has been approved by the DM
7 hours ago
 I am curious, how do you go about navigating your Wiki? The reason why I ask is that I normally sort by newest or recent but there are many things that you go back and make edits on and thus it rearranges things.
7 hours ago
 Hub
7 hours ago
 Hub and search bar
7 hours ago
 Pin for some cornercase junk
7 hours ago
 Hub is the main structure
7 hours ago
 When you say Hub what do you mean?
7 hours ago
 The tabs on the sidebar
7 hours ago
 Oh.
7 hours ago
 Hub is the first one (it's its own tiddler too, that's how i edit it)
7 hours ago
 this is worth your time, imho: https://philosopher.life/#Help%3A%20On%20This%20Wiki:%5B%5BHelp%3A%20On%20This%20Wiki%5D%5D

 An introduction to how to reason about, interpret, and navigate the wiki
7 hours ago
 You should think of Root as an actual directory structure. Basically the entire wiki sits inside of those few directories. But, I rarely navigate the wiki that way (that doesn't mean the file structure doesn't serve a purpose).
7 hours ago
 I believe the difficulty mainly arises because I come at it in a linear fashion one step and then the other. However, going back and forth, edits and the like, throw me off.
7 hours ago
 The real power of the wiki is its ability to be non-linear (3rd paragraph of {Help}). I feel your pain here.
7 hours ago
 [[ALM]], you have a very weird friend in me, lol.
7 hours ago
 Yeah, just reading a bit of a tiddler you linked to earlier.  I had a chuckle when not linear was mentioned.  Weird does not mean bad by any means.  We are both weird in our own ways.
6 hours ago
 agreed
6 hours ago
 I ran over your Dungeons &amp; Dragons tiddler and your character with the breaking the fourth wall is very funny but would certainly not be the way that I would choose to play the game.
6 hours ago
 aye, I've never heard of anyone playing the game like that
6 hours ago
 I'm really there to do it with my children, who take RPing and narratival gaming seriously in a way that isn't natural to me
6 hours ago
 I want to participate in their lives and be able to appreciate the stories they are telling themselves (in DnD and especially outside it)
6 hours ago
 I can certainly see the value in that. Excuse my arrogrance, doesn't breaking the 4th wall invalidate many of the purposes or pleasures of role playing?
6 hours ago
 I have a hard time seeing why. In my experience, most of the game is played OOC
6 hours ago
 One interesting thing I'm doing in this campaign is relinquishing control of any ludological, mechanical, and standard metagaming components.
6 hours ago
 my wife and the DM will pick all my spells, equipment, etc.
6 hours ago
 My statement makes many assumptions. I have truly never played the game in a group setting like it is meant to be played. I only have my experiences from other role playing games where I remember with great annoyance those who would break the fourth wall.
6 hours ago
 otherwise, I just break the game in half building invincible characters
6 hours ago
 It certainly sounds like it was for the best to have other shoes those aspects of the game for your character and yourself.  I do not envy the dungeon master one bit.
6 hours ago
 Lol shoes.
6 hours ago
 lol
6 hours ago
 Others choose
6 hours ago
 ha, well, I hope my DM doesn't see it that way (I don't think she does...so far, she seems to be enjoying it quite a bit)
6 hours ago
 imho, much of the game is played outside the actual session
6 hours ago
 but, I would say the same about most games I've played
6 hours ago
 what do you think RPing is about?
6 hours ago
 tried changing out RAM on the chromebook, but it's not replaceable
6 hours ago
 SoC it is
6 hours ago
 Sorry about that.  Had to go run an errand for an ingredient for dinner.  When it comes to RP, I would say that it is about telling a story that is overarching and finding one little player in the story and fleshing it out.  It allows someone to play a part in the story that they ordinarily would not play when it comes to their RL experience.  It would allow for them to be more bold as the consequences are far less severe than in RL.  They could be whatever they would like to be - and obviously we either follow rules made by others or are self-imposed to carry the story on and to live vicariously through their character in as realistically way as we can giving the setting.  One could, in essence, be less restrained in ones actions when in such a story versus how one would react in a more realistic world.  We get the chance to be a hero that we cannot be in RL because of whatever reasons.  We free ourselves from the tethers of this world to live for a time in another.  We willingly take the blue pill.  We know it is not real, but our mind makes it real - so long as the charade is not revealed and brought home by such things as breaking the 4th wall and excessive OOC conversations.  Whether or not such activity is healthy, good, or right is not what I am addressing here as I have an uncanny voice in my head whispering in my ear that seems to extol the perils of such activity.  No matter, one could always tell oneself that such behavior is far better than drinking alone to forget ones troubles.  Instead, the group gets away together and for a time gets to forget about the worries and the cares of this world while not overly interfering with its function.  Bread and circuses.  I will go so far as to say that the more I flesh this idea out the more and more I am led to believe that RP is a delusion that we willingly enter in to and try to make ourselves believe.  Oh my, what chains we have wrought for ourselves.  Don't break the 4th wall lest blissful ignorance be torn away to reveal the world as it truly is and what little power we truly wield in it.  A world that we did not choose to enter into and from which we are expelled at the will of another.  I can see why drugs and alcohol are so prevalent in our society and their abuse so widely accepted not to mention why the intelligent are far more likely to excessively partake in them.  RP must be for the middling minds who are yet dumb enough to allow the illusion to cover their eyes without stirring their rationality to tell them that it is not real - at least for a time.  While those who are on the upper end of the spectrum are not given the ability to accept the charade by their very nature and do not see in RP the escape because it does not work for them.  Sad their lot in life must be.  I do not know why I went where I went with this but I will let it stand where it is and let you make of it what you will.  Perhaps - I am playing the wrong video game.  I must pick up all of those copper coins.........I need time to think.  I will step away for a while.  Do not be alarmed.  It is not you, it is me.  For the first time in some time I see myself from outside myself - and am disgusted.  Perhaps some house cleaning is in order.
5 hours ago
 That is a very interesting argument. Some excellent moves in it. Might be worth thinking about this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine
4 hours ago
 Depending on the housecleaning, remember you can encrypt TW. Truecrypt/Veracrypt if you want to go even harder.  Not sure where you going, but I'm here to listen.
