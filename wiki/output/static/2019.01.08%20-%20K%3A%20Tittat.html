I checked out your resolutions for last year and this one. I feel the dieting aspect really hard. I lost thirty pounds last year and I‚Äôm aiming for another twenty this year. It‚Äôs a hard struggle. 

How are you today?
TUE 8:31 AM
I still don't know about my conclusions of 2018. I'm re-reading all of 2018's logs. There are probably 3k to read.
TUE 9:52 AM
(and edit, reorganize, comment, etc.)
TUE 9:53 AM
Seems like you‚Äôve succeeded at quite a few of them though. :)
TUE 9:54 AM
I'm in the process of [[The Remodeling]] on my wiki as part of the [[audit]] since I'm committing to it. This is going to take some serious doing. I'll be in a better position to answer your question about how I feel about 2018 with more depth in a couple months.
TUE 9:54 AM
Aye. The resolutions were okay. 2018 is much bigger for me to think about.
TUE 9:54 AM
I'm doing well enough.
TUE 9:54 AM
Wroking on all the projects, homeschooling, cooking, cleaning, and prepping for work.
TUE 9:55 AM
Oh right that reminds me. You‚Äôre looking into getting an office job again?
TUE 9:56 AM
Aye. I've been applying, but nothing so far.
TUE 9:56 AM
That sucks.
TUE 10:33 AM
I hope you hear something soon. :/
TUE 10:34 AM
So I have no idea what to expect from my final class today. It‚Äôs writing theory but my advisor just says ‚Äúpretend it‚Äôs philosophy‚Äù. Seems odd but this is a very required class for all English majors.
TUE 11:04 AM
I'm not holding my breath on getting a job. I'm just making it a game to apply and if I get lucky, I'll be happy. I'll try not to get too worried, lol.
TUE 11:06 AM
I feel it. 

I know I‚Äôm on the home stretch for my library gig and I have mixed feelings about it.
TUE 11:06 AM
I have known many philosophers who majored in English, Creative Writing, Literature, History, and other Humanities.
TUE 11:06 AM
Those subjects are doing philosophy when you look deep inside them.
TUE 11:07 AM
I'm a pretentious asshole on this point, ofc, lol.
TUE 11:08 AM
;)
TUE 11:08 AM
You‚Äôre good. Lmao
TUE 11:08 AM
I‚Äôll tell you more about it after it‚Äôs over. I‚Äôm really stumped on what exactly to expect.
TUE 11:08 AM
I would love to know!
TUE 11:09 AM
Tldr: analytical reading of classic books and movies and developing critical thinking as to more of the why something is the way that it is in regards to literary devices.
TUE 3:01 PM
This is going to be fucking sweet.
