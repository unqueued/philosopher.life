<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>Straight to voicemail</code></pre><p>My brother was very cold today. He was up in a lift most of the day with one person on the job who he doesn't like. The dude in a power (the foreman does nothing and hands it off to this guy) is as an asshole in general, even if he is nicer to my brother than others. My brother is concerned about that proposition that if you continue to find everyone is an asshole, then maybe you are the asshole.</p><p>I walked him through the bellcurve problem of cooperation and how we punish both those who are, on average (according to the masses), too vicious and too virtuous. People who are too good are punished for being too good. If you make people look bad or feel bad for being not as good, you will be punished.</p><p>He reflected on a co-worker who seems to live the most mundane, monotonous life.</p><p>My brother is crying over the loss of Raylan. He wish he had more pictures/video. He is picking up the pieces.</p><p>He considered the &quot;lack of a social playbook/rulebook/textbook&quot; that everyone else seemed to be born with. I need to speak with him about genetic and memetic/conditioned variants.</p><p>He didn't know I got the job, so I talked some about that. I also talked about some of the stuff I'm doing on the computer, but I think I he was bored by it. I hope to make my conversations with him enjoyable. I asked him for advice on games to play with the kids, but he explained that's not how it worked in Thailand.</p><p>We talked about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AIR.html">AIR</a> for a bit, and he ended the call to connect with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AIR.html">AIR</a>. Makes sense, since this his AIR's last day off for the week.</p><p>My brother wants me to watch the Thoroughbred movie. It looks good, and I want to make sure I can understand where he is coming from with it.</p></div>
