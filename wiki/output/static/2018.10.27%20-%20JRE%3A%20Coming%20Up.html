<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My brother is happy with the surgery. Sleep isn't much better, but everything else is improved.</p><p>My brother talked about how Rebecca felt there was little hope now after he spoke with her brother-in-law. It feels real to her. She is going to kick him out asap after Raylan goes. I advised he continue to think hard about it (I'm repeating myself in asking him to write about it). He has very little time now. I suggested he look into another residence. </p><p>Raylan is now going every weekend. It's ramping up.</p><p>He does not want to invalidate his feelings, inferences, beliefs, and experiences before the meds. Changing your mind might be different than that. I do not know. This is an area for which I don't have a good answer, and I fear I cannot solve it either (Ship of Theseus is here). He mentioned our discussion on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.10.02%2520-%2520JRE%253A%2520Aldi.html">2018.10.02 - JRE: Aldi</a> and discussions of sex before that. He said I previously did'nt press him on his reasoning about the matter, but he can see I thought the meds were doing him good in his ability to make inferences here. He's worried about this. I have absolutely no idea how to answer this.</p><p>Part of me thinks I write in my wiki to preserve my feelings (showing some validity) while still maintaining the power to deny, not assent to, or change them. </p><p>We talked about his shop. He's not buying more tools until he finishes a project. That makes good sense. Ofc, I hope he keeps in his list in a wiki.</p><pre><code>[[AA]] Replied
