<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Got bored at work, so here are my thoughts:</p><p>Freedom is a multi-faceted and hugely positive term encompassing the ability to act consciously, well-balanced and with self control towards a given constructive direction. It is oftentimes gauged by the degree of absence of external restraint or external control.</p><p>In general, Freedom is concerned with choice. I find it hard to separate â€œfreedomâ€ from the concept of â€œfree will.â€ The ability to do otherwise is what makes a person free.</p><p>This concept, freedom, is one dear to the hearts and minds of almost all of those in western culture. We idolize it, and even make up pseudonyms for it, like Liberty. By the way, we often mistakenly merge Freedom and Liberty, as they have much to do with each other. Liberty, however, is generally considered a concept of political philosophy and identifies the condition in which an individual has immunity from the arbitrary exercise of authority. This would be an external restraint; thus, Iâ€™d call Liberty a subset of freedom.</p><p>Regardless, everyone and their mother are deeply concerned with maintaining freedom and liberty. The crowd exclaims, â€œOh, noes! Donâ€™t violate my rights, freedoms and liberties!â€ Do they even understand what these words mean? Do they understand the significance? Do they understand the purpose of freedom?</p><p>So, what is so important about Freedom? Is it important in and of itself? Where does it come from? Is it natural?</p><p>Letâ€™s explore!</p><p>For the time being, I will have to make certain assumptions.</p><p>Premise number one: the universe is stable, calculable, and physically deterministic in every way. Billiard balls can cause other billiard balls to move when they strike each other. The universe is governed by physical laws that cannot be broken by anything wholly contained within that universe. All matter is subject to the laws of physics. And, regardless of what you may have read, concerning quantum mechanics and the appearance of randomness, I tell you there is far too much design and order to believe that this is random.</p><p>Now, now, does this mean that the laws of physics are never broken? No way! There ARE anti-entropic objects and institutions. In fact, when we evaluate the possibility of freedom inside a deterministic universe, we will surely find that the laws of physics cannot govern absolutely, they must be broken if freedom is to exist.</p><p>If you donâ€™t like the idea of a deterministic universe, then get out! I have no time for those who look at the universe as random. Even if randomness may or may not give us more ample opportunities to defend the concept of freedom, we would be abandoning the very things that would make freedom so significant. Free beings within a random and orderless structure canâ€™t make significant choices. Those beings would have no way to know the effect of an intended action. There really are a lot more complications to randomness. Even some pseudo-randomness (whatever that might be) sounds more like a cop-out and an indescribable and poorly put together concept of the universe than a real defense of freedom and reality.</p><p>Premise two: Those contained by the universe cannot naturally have power over the universe. In order to have power of the universe, one would have universe making-and-breaking properties. One constrained by the universe clearly didnâ€™t make that universe. Go figure.</p><p>Premise three: Thus, something greater than the universe must have created the universe, specifically, God. God is not imprisoned by the universe, and such order and design had to come from somewhere. Again, Godâ€™s existence, for the sake of the article, is assumed.</p><p>Alright. So, basically, for humans to be free means that we are breaking the laws of the universe. It means we are not bound by the laws of the universe. As we clearly are not the creators of the universe, then we must have acquired our free will through other means.</p><p>It is the old argument, the Imago Dei, that God has granted us â€˜choiceâ€™ through freedom. This means that God has granted humans the ability to break the laws of the universe. Which, yet again, is another old argument: The Unmoved mover.</p><p>God has instilled in us the ability to be an unmoved mover - Those who can move objects without moving themselves. We have a distinct causal power to act upon the universe without requiring physical abilities. How limited this may be, who knows? I suspect that we act upon our brains, as it is pretty central to our nervous systemâ€¦</p><p>As to the consideration of self-ownership as portion of freedom, we may apply Nozickian and Lockian proprietary philosophy, and simply say that God, the being who originally owned us, imbued us with the ability to own ourselves. It is ironic that Libertarian views are so unjustifiable, as they base freedom on utilitarian property law, which, when evaluated, is contradictoryâ€¦as people could not naturally own themselves. Luckily, we already have the key to abuse, use, and unlock the secrets to the heart of â€œfreedom fighting,â€ without having to agree that freedom is all that important, but while maintaining their basic premises.</p><p>Okay, so now we can say that it is at least possible for freedom to exist. What is it?</p><p>Freedom, or free will, is the ability to do otherwise. It can be the ability to think otherwise, believe otherwise, and physically act otherwise. It can be large or small, moral or immoral. Freedom gives true choices. Doing what you want to do isnâ€™t freedom. And, yes understanding freedom within the psychological and egoist determinism is difficult. We must simply explain that in some possible world, a free person chose otherwise, regardless of this determinism. Essentially, a free person, even in the context of psychological determinism, only needs to have the ability to do otherwise, regardless of whether they actually do in reality choose to do otherwise is somewhat inconsequential. In light of some possible worldsâ€™ argument, we can simply explain psychological determinism in terms of probabilitiesâ€¦but not necessities.</p><p>So, what is the significance and purpose of freedom?</p><p>We have freedom because we have the Imago Dei; God imbued us with the Image Dei; thus, God gave us freedom (or free will). A gift from God is already amazing enough, and must have innate value simply because of that. The very Image of God is a precious thing as well, thus we may think that beings with this ability would simply have innate value in virtue of the autonomy or the gift itself, on top of the value that stems from simple existence and being a gift from God. Clearly, it is very significant at this level. Kantian ethics can apply hereâ€¦.well, maybe. Iâ€™m not yet going to say that people are ends in themselves. But, at least we can verify that people are important, in part, because of this Imago Dei.</p><p>Ah, but defeating the laws of physics just doesnâ€™t seem THAT important. And, you know what, God also gave us the properties of existence, like everything else in the worldâ€¦so being a gift from God may not be enough either. There is a reason for this freedom.</p><p>Freedom is the architect of responsibility!!! Rocks falling from cliffs, water flowing down a stream, and even spiders spinning their webs are reacting to their respective deterministic environments and NOT responsible for their actions. These things HAD to occur. It isnâ€™t as if they could have done otherwise. Even the spider didnâ€™t have a choice. Thisâ€¦animal is just composed of chemicals reacting to the particles around it. We are more than mere chemical reactions! The rest of the universe is not. The rest of the universe has no choice in what it does. The universe is a machine, a very complex one, but a machine non-the-less. It is enslaved to the deterministic laws of physics. The creator of such a machine is responsible for it. The unmoved movers that act upon and within it are responsible for that which exists and occurs within the universe.</p><p>Our original Unmoved mover is God Himself. All that is beautiful and natural in the world is good, and created by God alone. Our freedom has acted upon the world, and yes, we are responsible for it; we, however, have created that which is painful and evil in this world.</p><p>With freedom, we have the ability to influence, to create and modify this machine we live within. Our creation; our responsibility.</p><p>As we own ourselves, and can recreate ourselves (to some extent), then we are also responsible for ourselves. Our actions have meaning! This isnâ€™t random. This isnâ€™t deterministic. This is choice.</p><p>Choice and responsibility manufacture the existence of MORALITY. Our choices arenâ€™t just choices, they entail something more. Choices are moral choices. They entail substance, and relevance. If you believe relevance and significance can exist, then you must believe it exists through this alone. Good and bad stem from choices. Morality IS significance. It means there is a value to what we do. And, a reason we should do some things, and reason we should not do other things.</p><p>Freedom is the foundation of Morality. Freedom allows for the possibility of moral choices. Freedomâ€™s relevance is found in that it creates the possibility for us, and our choices, to be relevant. There is a huge different between a Godbot and someone who can deny the Will of God.</p><p>Freedom exists for us to BE moral people. We are free so that we can choose to fulfill the Will of God. The ultimate purpose of our freedom is to give that freedom back to God, when we give up our desires to follow Godâ€™s Will. We are free for the sake of Godâ€™s glory.</p><p>Great!        Weâ€™ve solved the mystery. Now what?</p><p>Well, people donâ€™t view freedom as this. People want to think they have â€œinalienableâ€ rights, and freedom for the sake of themselves. People believe freedom exists for the pursuit of Happiness!?? WTF are they thinking? They use Freedom to be hedonists, to pursue themselves!</p><p>Freedom is IDOLIZED in our culture. In our self-worship, we have proclaimed â€“freedom- as our best attribute, and the thing we should base our lives around. We act as if it is THE thing to protect. We act as if freedom, in virtue of our oh-so-obvious self-importance, has become an end in itself, as if Freedom were innately significant, rather than a tool and catalyst for that which is importantâ€”The Glory of God!.</p><p>Freedom is not innately important, and it isnâ€™t some inalienable right, as God can always take away what He has given. Freedom exists for us to serve God, to become slaves once again.</p><p>We are blasphemers and idolaters. We pursue ourselves, happiness, and freedom. We do not seek that which is most important.</p></div>
