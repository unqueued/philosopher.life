<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Lots of sympathies on the j3d1h's Minutes Out (her escape). Apparently, it happens. Of course, life seems even more fragile when slip ups happen in such large quantity. We will try not to underestimate this child. She can be deceptively smart, as exhibited in several instances. We are now using minor punishments as it is clear that she understands yes, no, and certain commands. Putting her in her room is what we are doing for now (she hates it in there, except when she wants to sleep). When she becomes further sentient I'll be using the corner. Although, as we've taken her pacifier away from daytime use, she has decided to use her sharp teeth on other objects. It has been a struggle to teach her not to bite people, nor hit people. We are very firm with her (and for now our facial expressions make her cry). If she goes any further she may need to have her hands tenderly slapped. I can't have her being abusive towards anyone, especially not k0sh3k.</p><p>Also, I'm no longer subscribing to WoW. =( ...I think I would do better to write my own game.</p><p>Anyways, onto our awesome news: We are pregnant again!!! WOOT WOOT!! We have tried and tried; It has been a year and a half, and we didn't think it would ever come (the contraceptive shot was extremely overpowering). But, finally we have been blessed again. I just found out this morning. Boomshakalaka!! So, we have good reason to stay in KY for now. Of course, we'll still be aiming to goto school and Thailand thereafter.</p><p>Oh, yeah, we have been asked to teach a second Sunday school class. Actually, I have been asked, but I don't feel comfortable doing it. k0sh3k does such a good job, I am better at clarifying and helping with background work. I can be a wizard as a student, and I'm much better in 1 on 1 conversation. But, I don't have what it takes to communicate or teach to the masses. I'm confrontational, elitist, somewhat disturbed, and I lack the ability to draw out the steps I've taken to reach my conclusions. It takes a very smart person to follow what I am saying in several subject matters. The problem, essentially, is that I cannot help someone see the world as I do, I cannot teach someone to howto acquire and use my lens. I see the answer, but I can't show my work. It is frustrating to say the least. I have long had this problem. I do not write my answers out. My deductions are so severely layered, often based in a cross of several subjects that require at least intermediate knowledge, that I don't have a compatible language to communicate and discuss what I am thinking.</p><p>This reminds me of the very context in which I was asked to teach this class. We were in a seminar about &quot;Methodism&quot;. All the pastors showed up, one of them previously a professor. It was clear that these people were morons. They don't even follow their own religious structures, how could they possibly understand what I am thinking? I sit in a room of people doing addition and subtraction while I'm doing Calculus. I cannot explain calculus to someone who can barely comprehend the fundamentals. While I am good in many subjects, the truth is that I am a prodigy in the philosophy of religion. God has granted me an extraordinary talent. Will I use my talent to change the world? It would be nice, but perhaps not (I don't know God's plan for me). It is possible that God gives gifts to people just for them to glorify God directly. My knowledge deepens my faith, my reverence, and my awe. When I sit in a room of people who can barely add and subtract, I feel sorry that they cannot see the beauty of mathematics, or in this analogy, I feel sorry that they cannot see the beauty of the intelligence, rationality, significance, and design of this world and of the Master of the Universe. No doubt, He is. I cannot teach this wisdom if they are unwilling to pursue the truth.</p><p>It is here that I question what, or sometimes if, I will teach. The Sunday school class is a starting place. We will see. I am glad I married k0sh3k. There are√Ç only a√Ç handful of people in this world with such an orthodox handle of the scripture, the depth of knowledge in philosophy, and the mind to appreciate what we do. We are equally yoked. She keeps me sane, she keeps me thinking, she keeps me happy.</p><p>God, Give us direction, Give us wisdom, and help us to do Your Will.</p></div>
