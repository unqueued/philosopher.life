We will study foundational philosophical concepts, frameworks, and terminology. We will do our best to rigorously examine and evaluate brief excerpts from canonical philosophical texts with charity and curiosity. Through our readings and discussions, we will attempt to cover a broad range of major branches of philosophy; and, to some extent, we will consider the historical progression of certain prominent philosophical ideas. Lastly, our goal will be to engage in essential philosophical practices. These practices include: careful reasoning through arguments, polite participation in debates, thoughtful exegesis, strategic writing, and searching for rational answers to valuable and difficult philosophical questions.</p><p>Program &amp; Learning Outcomes:</p><p>Students become acquainted with a range of thinkers, topics, and approaches to philosophy.</p><p>In both classroom discussion and written work, students should demonstrate the ability to analyze ideas and present them clearly, providing viable arguments and evidence for their claims.</p><p>Specific Course Outcomes:</p><p>To develop an appreciation for terminology and concepts in Western philosophy</p><p>To discuss and think about the philosophical issues in the development of Western philosophy</p><p>Course Requirements &amp; Grading:</p><p>Discussion Board (30%)</p><p>For every assigned reading, each student is required to write their own +100 word post in the appropriate forum. You can either create a new thread (with a unique topic) or reply to one.</p><p>We may have multiple assigned readings for the day. You will need to write a post for each of these assigned readings before the beginning of the class period on which we discuss it in class.</p><p>Each post needs to do some sort of philosophical work. You could explain a problem with the argument. You could wrestle with different ways to interpret the argument. You could consider the implications of the argument. In any case, you need to clearly demonstrate that you‚Äôve actually read and thought about the assignment. Please write formal, grammatically correct sentences.</p><p>Final Exam/Paper (70%)</p><p>Paper topics must be directly tied to one of the readings in the book.</p><p>Ideally, you will talk with me about your paper topic before you begin writing it. I want you to write on a topic that interests you while also having a topic appropriate for the class.</p><p>Papers will be 10 pages, double-spaced, no added space between paragraphs or text, using size-12 font Times New Romans, with 1‚Äù margins, pagination, in .docx or .pdf file-formatting. Both a title page and bibliography are required (these aren‚Äôt included in the 10 page-count).</p><p>You will submit a digital copy of your paper (used to check for plagiarism and formatting) by 6:00pm on August 10th.</p><p>Participation &amp; Preparation: Philosophy is not a passive endeavor. Students should attend and actively participate in class discussions. Students should offer pertinent comments and ask/answer relevant questions. Always bring a copy (either digital or print) of the day‚Äôs reading assignment(s) with you to class.</p><p>Lateness Policy: Unexcused late work will not be accepted. Unless excused, you will receive a failing grade on any forum posts or exams/papers which aren‚Äôt submitted on time.</p><p>Cheating &amp; Plagiarism Policy: Plagiarism and cheating are obviously unacceptable. If I have evidence of either occurring, I will refer the case to the Honor Board. See: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://tulane.edu/college/code.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://tulane.edu/college/code.cfm</a>.</p><p>Office Hours &amp; Contact: I encourage you to come to me with any questions you have related to the course material or your studies more generally. Please feel free to stop by or to schedule an appointment with me.</p><p>Content &amp; Schedule: Course content comes straight from our anthology. Our schedule is tentative. It will be flexible and subject to change. I will announce changes in advance.
