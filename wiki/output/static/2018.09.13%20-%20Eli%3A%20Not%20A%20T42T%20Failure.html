<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Hey there. I hope you are doing well.</p><p>I've been watching and I've been thinking. I'm sorry that my [response](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://eli.li/entry.php?id=20180821015058" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eli.li/entry.php?id=20180821015058</a>) wasn't clear. It wasn't my intention to side-step your questions. I was, in my (albeit broken) way attempting to honestly answer your questions.</p><blockquote><p>At the very least, T42T means being more forgiving in the dialectic than my interlocutor (by how much, I do not know). Essentially, the blame of a failure to cooperate must not rest with me.</p></blockquote><p>The blame is mine. So, if you don't mind, I'd like to answer more directly.</p><blockquote><p>I would like for you to say more. What are you afraid of? Where is the world going? Will you continue to walk the desert as you do? Why? </p></blockquote><p>What am I afraid of? **People**.</p><p>Why am I afraid of people? Because they are unpredictable. I believe that your intent was not malicious, nor was it to frighten me. It was, nonetheless, frightening to see my family's address codified into a single location.</p><p>Pragmatically I understand that this information is mere moments away at anytime...</p><p>Fear, however, is very often not a pragmatic response. I was afraid.</p><p>Where is the world going? **I do not know.**</p><p>It is easy for me to imagine frightening futures, and it seems to be becoming more difficult for me to imagine better ones. I am not pleased with this, but it is where I am currently at.</p><p>At heart I am often anarchist. But it is difficult to believe (read perhaps as &quot;trust&quot;) in anarchism when one struggles to trust other folks. It is something I'm working on.</p><p>Will you continue to walk the desert as you do? Why? **I honestly do not know, but I hope to continue to struggle with the walk. To engage in it with intention and open ears**.</p><p>There is something more that I wanted to say about &quot;consent,&quot; but it isn't a fully formed thought yet, so, instead I leave this pointer as a reminder, more to myself than for you, indicating that I'm still thinking through your questions, and I hope that you don't mind that my answers might not be always direct, but I'll do my best.</p><p>It isn't connected to this conversation, I don't think, but I've been thinking a lot lately about [&quot;Biopower&quot;](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopower" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopower</a>) and what relationship it has to the web. It is something I think you may have interesting insight into.</p></div>
