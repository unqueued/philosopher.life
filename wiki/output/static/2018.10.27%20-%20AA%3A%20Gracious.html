<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>Swathes of my letter have been made obsolete with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.10.28%2520-%2520AA%253A%2520Signal.html">real-time communication</a>. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AA.html">AA</a> reached out from my initial draft over instant messaging. To some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, I complete this letter for posterity's sake and to formally celebrate! Since we're messaging real-time, you may not feel it necessary to continue letterwriting. I'm fine with whatever is most comfortable for you here.</em></p><p>Dear <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AA.html">AA</a>,</p><p>I am overjoyed to hear from you. I have re-read my letter to you many times since sending it to you. I didn't know how or when you might respond. It has turned my stomach inside out. It is clear to me that you have sacrificially spent yourself to write to me. I am sorry for the pain of it. Thank you for your gracious response. I hope to do you justice!</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am truly happy to hear from you both. Words are a hard medium for me sometimes they are almost painful. I struggle to express myself well and am never happy with the outcome. I am writing this in small amounts throughout my day. (now days) Please if I have written something that may seem offensive that I truly mean no offense.
</p></blockquote><p>I wish I had a better medium.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">m</sup></button> I am grateful to your willingness to endure it. For what it's worth, I think you express yourself well.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">g</sup></button> Further, you have not offended me. I ask you to forgive the aggressively guarded tone of my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.08.11%2520-%2520AA%2526UJ%253A%2520Thank%2520You.html">previous letter</a>. The ongoing fallout with my donors has been traumatic. I have been prepared to defend myself against undue political and emotional violence,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button> and I apologize for failing to immediately demonstrate the trust and vulnerability you deserve. Please forgive my doubt and predictive failures; I aim to demonstrate my integrity to you as well. I hope to make it up to you.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I really wanted to let you know that I am thinking about you (all of you) and since words are tricky, I chose gifts because I do better with those.
</p></blockquote><p>When I think about my own gift-giving, I compare myself to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">l</sup></button> Since I can remember, you have been the measurement of virtuous gift-giving to me. Giving gifts is difficult because it can demonstrate how much (or how little) we understand and care about the recipient. Few people can express they know you with a gift. You have long been consistently accurate and efficient with how you give <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="salient.html">salient</a> gifts. Your gifting talent is your language of love. I consider it a sign of your profound empathy.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I hope the kidlets enjoyed the toys. 
</p></blockquote><p>They have. Thank you. </p><p>Speaking of kidlets, how is your daughter, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AG.html">AG</a>? I speak with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="L.html">L</a> regularly, but I barely even know <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AG.html">AG</a> (which is in no small part my fault). In fact, how's life for your family in general? I anticipate it will take quite a while to unfold this.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The shirt was not my first choice but Pok√©mon cards or Mario Party wouldn‚Äôt do either. I hope it wasn‚Äôt offensive. I was really looking for computer humor but failed to find what I wanted.
</p></blockquote><p>Thank you for the shirt as well. I see you mean it thoughtfully, and I will proudly wear it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">p</sup></button> Outside of the context, I actually thought the shirt was funny. You do know me. You did not fail; I think your reaching out has been successful. Again, I ask for your forgiveness. I did not know what your gift meant, and I should have known better! I am indebted to your graceful response to my paranoia. You heap burning coals on my foolish head.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The book on the other hand was from a study that I was doing earlier this year. The study started with another workbook and several videos that we went through together as a group. The book was after I got to know the author through the videos so I didn‚Äôt catch some of the things that you did. But as I read it, I thought often of the two of you because it is your wheel house and I am interested in your thoughts. I will need to go back and read chapter one after reading your thoughts so I will get back to you on that. I can share the videos if you are interested and have a Gmail.
</p></blockquote><p>I would prefer to consider the book first, but I'll watch the videos as well if you think it worthy.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">gm</sup></button> As you'll find in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Link%2520Log.html">Link Log</a>, I have a tendency to avoid video (though it cannot always be avoided). <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Reading.html">Reading</a> is faster, easier to cite and wrestle, and often saves me the time of transcribing. I appreciate your willingness to think about it with me. For various reasons, most people do not want to study with me. I will study with you as carefully as I can.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You have known me all of your life. You have seen me at my worst and hopefully as I have grown through the struggle. I understand depression because I have been more in than out of that pit since 14ish.
</p></blockquote><p>Indeed. You do understand!</p><p>I regret not speaking more to you about it these decades. I have seen you drowning in depression, climbing out tooth'n'nail again and again;<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">tm</sup></button> If I could go back, I would have reached out and listened to you much more closely. I'm sorry. I now better know what it's like to have the wolf on one's back, and you have been a gladiator in that pit.</p><p>Yet again, you have been a guide here. I have many times thought about your depression in considering my own. I have come to appreciate your struggle and integrity far more these past years.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">am</sup></button></p><p>I do not wish to harm you, conjure bad memories, open old wounds, or fail you. I have strong opinions about the structures and causes of who we are. I am worried that looking through my lens will be horrifying for you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ps</sup></button> I'd like to think we have both come a very long way.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>No one however has told me about your autism. Please tell me about where you are on the spectrum because each person is different and I want to understand as best as I can.
</p></blockquote><p>I am surprised. I appreciate your interest in trying to understand me in this.</p><p>I'm a fairly high-functioning autist, enough so that many people don't know it. I didn't know until my late 20's, though some others I've met knew before I did. It wasn't until one of my classes in moral psychology where we dissected autism that my professor pointed it out in me (as we were also discussing my autistic son at the time). I have been exploring ever since. I am still coming to understand how it influences my perceptions. Much of my life has begun to make more sense now that I have fit a semblance of this section of the puzzle together.</p><p>The clinical definition of the spectrum continues to evolve. I wouldn't call my instance of autism an unconditional disorder; it has been maladaptive in some respects, but it has been a useful gift in others. My ability to empathize relies upon my ability to cognitively reverse-engineer theories of mind in order to affectively mirror, interpret, and relate to others. Whatever cognitive intelligence I have has been bent and channeled into trying to makeup for deficits in my affective intelligence, and I aim to improve in my ability to empathize and enable others to empathize with me (this wiki is one such step).</p><p>Autism is linked to bottom-up processing, reasoning, or induction based data-driven perception closely linked to the stimulus. On the other side of the Bayesian empirical equation, Schizophrenia appears linked to top-down processing, deduction, and modeling our perceptions with our background knowledge and frameworks. Autism and schizophrenia run in our family. Much of what makes up for my deficits happens to be reaching for schizophrenic modeling. You may find this a weird thing to hear, but I literally aim to be schizophrenic <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a>, since I consider it the other side of the golden mean which I must shoot for. When I'm being intelligent, it's because I've worked hard to impose preconceived models on my perceptions. I take serious risks to do this, but I am convinced it is the wisest method available to me (knowing full well I can be wrong).</p><p>Fun fact, there is a correlation between autism and female family members excelling in STEM. Also, I think part of the reason my wife and I instantly connected so effectively is that she was raised with her uncle, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Charlie.html">Charlie</a>, an autistic savant; I believe she is an aspie herself.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am reading through your wiki and it will take me a while because each section will take me more than one reading. So please excuse my slowness. 
</p></blockquote><p>These are further magic words, an answer to my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Litmus%2520Test.html">Wiki Litmus Test</a>. This wiki is overdetermined, and one of the sufficient reasons I use it is simply to understand whether or not someone actually cares about what I think and feel (which doesn't mean they agree with me). Dyadic meta-accuracy is not my strong suit. As a mind-blind autist, thinking about how others reason about my wiki is the most effective evidence-based means I have for recursively modeling how others model me. It is my externalist tool for building a reliable indicator of what my relationships are (which is not the claim it is nearly as reliable as I'd wish for).</p><p>I had considered reading a book of my choice with you as well.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pw</sup></button> But, I'd rather ask you to continue hyperreading the wiki, understanding its structure and how to search it; I believe that would be a better use of our time for the time being. I do not ask you to read it all (since there is simply too much), but I ask you to explore. Please feel free to ask for clarification, and please excuse my mess. If I knew what I was doing, this wiki would make more sense.</p><p>Perhaps you will find it odd to hear me say it, but I am grateful that you find reading me worth your time. Thank you.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am not a quick or complex thinker so it takes me time to process, digest and conclude.
</p></blockquote><p>I respectfully disagree. I understand you are being humble and modest. Overall, I consider myself a digestive thinker like you. Even through your depression, which is linked to considerable IQ losses, memory deficits, and neurogenesis impairment, you have always been intelligent. I think you've been forced to wear the heavy handicap burden of depression for decades and still demonstrated you are a complex thinker.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">hb</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Grandma Lois told me from her death bed that I was born to be ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to be the middle man for any of you.
</p></blockquote><p>I can see her saying that to you. That must have been a difficult thing to hear. I disagree with your creator's assessment, and I don't think you should be in the middle either. You are your own person, and I'm going to re-establish communications with <em>you</em>.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I want to have my own relationship with each person based on my own interactions with that person. What that means to me is that we share fun, laughter, memories, games, sorrow, grief, ideas, thoughts and respect.
</p></blockquote><p>Yes! I very much appreciate this claim. Let's do it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am willing to listen to what you have to say without any preconceived ideas from others if you are willing to do the same.
</p></blockquote><p>Yes, ma'am; you got it. You have my openness too: please, hold me to it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ds</sup></button> I will give you every <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Straussian.html">Straussian</a> interpretive muscle I can.</p><p>So, given that: I agree to the spirit of the law, though the letter becomes fuzzy. So, I'm forever the <strike>asshole</strike> impolite philosopher (send him to the gallows! ;P). There's something incredibly right about the goal. Conceptually, I also think it's not possible to escape having preconceived ideas for a number of reasons, but I think we can attenuate what we bring to the table in interpreting each other. I take you to already mean that.</p><p>I mean you no offense, but I think you will find my point of view terrifying. I am regularly told that it is painful (almost <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a>lessness inducing) to see the world through my eyes. I name evil what it is here. I know you have seen real darkness. My vision of the world is bleak, damning, and divisive. I have found people find it more convenient to dismiss my extremist view than to consider the possibility that I'm right. I tend to think it's depressive realism.</p><p>I suggest you are also hinting about my donors here. Again, I appreciate the open goal of respectful objectivity and just being there with each other. Maybe it's something like &quot;keepin' it real.&quot;</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I loved you as a little baby boy traveling from Chicago to Boston because you were my brother‚Äôs son and I loved my brother more than anything. (He was my protector.) 
</p></blockquote><p>Without a doubt, this is the most moving section of your letter. You have known me my whole life. =)</p><p>I understand he has been your protector in several contexts. He is a different man to different people; he is and has been many things to me. I do not aim to step between you and your brother. I know what it's like to deeply love one's brothers. I owe my life many times over to my brothers.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I loved you as a toddler because you loved me back and I was a kid too. I loved you as a young teenager and sought to learn about the things that interested you so that we could spend time together even though it got me in trouble often with your mom.
</p></blockquote><p>I think you lent me some outside perspective and sanity more than once. I can recall several times you got in trouble or had disagreements (with both <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="MWF.html">MWF</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SLT.html">SLT</a>). I appreciate your willingness to do so. The troubles you experienced refactored my perceptions of them more than you might know.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You and JRE were always great big brothers to L and we both love you for that. (AIR was always a playmate and their relationship was different but loved as well.)
</p></blockquote><p>It has been wonderful to have a sister. I regret that I have not been a brother to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AG.html">AG</a>. But, I hope my kids can be good playmates and friends with her. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Somewhere after that, your interests outgrew me and I couldn‚Äôt keep up with you. (My mind does not think the deep thoughts that yours does so
easily. Also, I have two methods of dealing with depression besides meds. One is to stay so busy that I can‚Äôt give it space and the other is to sleep. Neither is good for keeping up with family and friends.) We both have had growing families too and distance between us. 
</p></blockquote><p>I can appreciate your methods. Looking back, that makes sense to me. </p><p>I can't say I've done a good job of finding a solution for myself. Doctors and prescription meds didn't help. As a matter of survival, I ended up having to take matters into my own hands. I grew psilocybin mushrooms and purchased deschloroketamine. Not being a scientist, it took some doing to research these options before they were more widely recognized as experimental medicines for treatment-resistant depression (especially without much support). I credit these substances with pulling me from the brink. The wiki has been a CBT tool for restructuring my life and securing a number of components of my identity. Again, however, I can't say I've escaped depression. I think I can only manage it. I'm hoping it someday clears up.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">rf</sup></button> </p><p>Yeah, depression makes maintaining relationships crazy hard. I appreciate your choice to reach out to us multiple times. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Regardless, I really just want to have a relationship with you and your family. I know that there will be differences in beliefs and I can accept that and even discuss it without being angry or feeling threatened.
</p></blockquote><p>Awesome. Thank you for your constructive approach. That's my goal too.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It is much later now‚Ä¶ ( so late) but I have read and re-read my letter and though I am not happy about the words, I cannot have you wait any longer for an answer.
</p></blockquote><p>Late indeed: ~4am! I know that feeling of being up late writing (I often can't sleep either, but you know that). I am touched that you do so.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Know that I love you all and you are welcome to our home (messy as it is) anytime. We are again planning a huge Thanksgiving with K‚Äôs family and you are always welcome to join us. Unfortunately it is still being held at College Heights because that is the only free space that can hold all of us and I know that there are memories there that you would rather not visit. But‚Ä¶ we get together, graze all day, play games, enjoy each other‚Äôs company and laugh and have fun. If not, we should plan another time. =)</p><p>Love always</p><p>AA
</p></blockquote><p>Thank you for inviting us to Thanksgiving. We very much want to come. We talked about it trying to figure out a way to make it work. Unfortunately, since we have already planned to visit <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a>'s mom, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="R.html">R</a>, for the holiday, we aren't going to make it. I strongly considered going solo, but upon further analysis, I think it is crucial that I visit her.</p><p>We will plan another way to see each other in person.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>h0p3</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">m : </span> I tend to quote-and-reply to make sure I've systematically addressed with reference.

I don't know if you would be interested in instant messaging with me through it.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">tm : </span> It was apparent to me before I even understood what depression meant (to whatever <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> I did and do).</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">am : </span> Relatedly, my empathy for the fragmentation of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AM.html">AM</a> has dramatically increased as well.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">ps : </span> My brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> has said that sometimes we are eating at a dinner table being served a pile of shit, and I'm the only one who looks at what's on the plate and says it outloud.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">pw : </span> Having grown up as a PK, you might enjoy <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em> (though I wouldn't be surprised to find you've read it already).</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">hb : </span> I'm reminded of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://archive.org/stream/HarrisonBergeron/Harrison%20Bergeron_djvu.txt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harrison Bergeron</a>.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">ds : </span> In terms of the Big-5 psychometric, I'm both extremely disagreeable and open.
