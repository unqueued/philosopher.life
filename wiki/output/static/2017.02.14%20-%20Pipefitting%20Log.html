<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I guess I was able to convince my teacher yesterday (despite his &quot;you've gotta learn to crawl before you can walk&quot; response) to allow us to try special offsets (it was the natural next step, since we've covered regular offsets already in practice). I did the math right. We had difficulty figuring out how to measure it (the protractor is broken and we were misguided by another student). After we figured it out though, we got it built. Everything looked clean. The teacher eventually checked it out (his alcoholism and personal life really get in the way of him actually being present to do his job). He checked the levels, the rise (neat trick which I'm glad to have used, since I knew that is what he would be using the check it with), and the center-to-center lengths of the pipes. I always check these, since I know that's what he's going to do. He said everything looked great (because it did; I wouldn't have handed in half-assed work). </p><p>Afterward, I voiced my worry that I had used the level+measuring tape to check that our rise was correct, but I wasn't quite sure how to do it for the offset (he should have taught us that today instead of getting drunk, wandering, and watching Youtube,  since this was our first time doing special offsets). He showed me (it was a simple rotation, and I'm embarrassed I didn't see it), and when we checked it, the length was off by an entire fucking inch. In pipe, especially at the scale we were working at, that is like missing by a mile. I was mortified.</p><p>Since he had already passed it, he didn't want to go back on what he said. It was obvious that he wished he didn't pass it. It shouldn't have passed. I know I didn't pass it. Something was really wrong, but neither the teacher nor I could give a satisfactory answer (my partner, Nash, doesn't give a shit: a pass is a pass to him).</p><p>I have spent time trying to figure out what we did wrong. I'm pretty baffled. The teacher claimed it was that our parallel pipes against the Run weren't perfectly level. But, I checked those very carefully (and even the teacher saw it). I don't think that accounted for being an entire inch off. I checked the math, especially since we are forced to round our degrees and lengths (which can vary up to a half a degree in rise and roll, and sometimes a 1/16th of an inch in length) - rounding couldn't account for that much difference either. I know I will be trusting that broken (some of our fellow students broke it) a lot less, and I'm going to measure a lot more by hand. Maybe it was a combination. I don't know. I'm actually disappointed in my work today. Clearly, the &quot;learning to crawl&quot; claim is still accurate. Well, shit. That's okay. We've all got to start somewhere.</p><p>I need to learn more leveling, a-plumbing?, and degree measurement tricks. I need to see the right, cleanest, and fastest way in advance. I at least did the right thing in building the special offset before building the edges (which is the more natural approach). Well, I hope he gives me a couple more special offsets. I clearly need the practice. That puts me behind the schedule I wanted to be on, but I am strongly convinced I need to understand putting geometry+trig into practice like the back of my hand. It doesn't matter what kind of pipe of construction method you are using, the math is always fundamentally going to be the same (TO's vary, ofc). </p><p>On a positive note, because the teacher was screwing around (and I was forced to sit around waiting for his input [normally I read ahead in the book, but there is less for me to read now]), a fellow student, Connor (who is obviously not a fool) taught me to use one of our welding machines. Having read about it, I knew a bit about what to expect. Let me tell you: welding is really hard. It's an art. I've gazed at a lot of Welder Porn, and my beadwork is a giant pile of shit. Connor said my first time was still decent, and better than any of his partners (all in the last trimester, but they are retarded). I also got to tack for Connor's buttweld object. I can tack. The actual welding (which thankfully, neither the tack nor the welding will ever be in my job description as a pipefitter), fuck no. I'm looking forward to practicing a ton just because it's fun and could be useful later.</p></div>
