We built stuff; I enjoyed building stuff with you. You've been helping with Sphygmus's button work and trying to wrangle Firmcoding, too. Thank you. You have set up several Bob scripts to make the process better, and you did the Spongebob script - basically, the back-end administrative work. I appreciate that you help me build this thing. I had that terrible Bob crash this week; you crafted the script that would pull the specific info from the tiddlers folder - thank you. Thank you for helping me to kill and restart Bob - it's a new tool for me, and I am grateful for your help in learning and using it. </li><li>I think you can be a very passionate person - like about Undertale and Delta Rune and music. </li><li>I can't remember the last time I had to intervene with you about your hair or clothes! </li></ul></li><li>k0sh3k<ul><li>I've done a good job keeping with Advent this year</li><li>You're a good teacher in Sunday school</li><li>Good job getting the lentil swoop recipe</li><li>I appreciate that you have shopped with and for everyone for Christmas.
