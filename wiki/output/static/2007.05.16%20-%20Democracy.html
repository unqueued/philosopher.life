<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Democracy is the doctrine that the numerical majority of an organized group can make decisions binding on the whole group (literally: Majority rules). Mind you, Democracy is a word used with pride in America. We live and die by this very word. And, for a long time, I agreed. Why wouldn't I agree to democracy? After all, the majority told me it was good.</p><p>Now (oh yes, in my age of wisdom), I don't see how one can think so highly of democracy at face value. What is so special about it? Why should we implement it? The usual argument is both bland and ambiguous, and yet its invalid conclusion is so deeply important to people that we fail to fully think through the premises and implications of democracy (i.e. the invalid argument). The basic premise is that democracy (supposedly) grants us &quot;freedom&quot;. How and who are we that are freed through democracy? What is freedom? Why should we pursue freedom? Even if one could possibly show a link between democracy and freedom, I wonder if people are too lazy to justify the meaning and purpose of &quot;freedom&quot;. Obviously, freedom exists in virtue of moral decisions. And, even if someone got that far (not a big leap), most are too stupid to define what is &quot;moral&quot;. If they think of democracy as a means to these wonderful ideals (freedom-&gt;morality), then they need to be able to defend the conclusions as well. Specifically, they better be able to defend morality and freedom (you wouldn't think such things need explanation and defense, but they must be justified if these are the aims of democracy). But, I will attempt to be charitable (after all, I myself am sucked into the argument from time to time).</p><p>Democracy is the idea that you have a guarenteed stake or some degree of control in your destiny. And, the latter is almost definitional of modern views of freedom. Albeit, democracy, direct or representative, rarely lends more than very slight, nomiminal, or sometimes illusionary degrees of control. You are one in a million pushing this way or that way. But, remember kids, &quot;your vote counts&quot;. This is true. And, insofar as you count with the masses, you have an &quot;equal&quot; vote of power (or at least the illusion of it in practice).</p><p>Democracy can be touted as a &quot;fair&quot; system, in which the poor man's vote counts as much as the rich man's. Now, obviously I'm not talking about the corruption we see today, I'm talking about the ideal democracy (which we are far from). And, obviously, we can all appreciate the aim to eliminate descrimination for such arbitrary reasons as race, gender, or social status. Democracy rides upon our desire for &quot;equality&quot;.</p><p>Democracy also seems to be a better alternative than something like a monarchy, as we have seen in practice. In a monarchy you are either the one or you are the screwed. Right? So, in order to even the odds of having any power of yourself at all, democracy at least gives you some upfront guarentee. And, of course, one person can be wrong, but could millions? Which leads us to our next point:</p><p>Democracy uses the invisible hand to guide us towards what is most useful (or atleast in theory it does). In a fair and vacuumous dissection of democracy, we can see a network of minds and choices that adapt and evolve into a better society.</p><p>And, finally, I think that many would consider democracy, while not perfect, the most practical option, or, at the very least, it can be the &quot;lesser of the evils&quot;. The basis of their argument is that practicality makes right, not right makes right. Democracies are corrupt. And, you may argue that every argument befalls this, and that the democracy is most resilient in virtue of masses with choice.</p><p>All seemingly good concrete arguments, right?</p><p>Even moving to the abstract conception, concerning the role/purpose of government, the meta-ethical evaluation of rights, utility/deontology debates, etc., we find that democracy excels in answering these questions. At the very least, democracies would seem as if they are adaptive to a culture. They are powerful, and yet, this does not mean that democracy is correct.</p><p>What is right is not always practical, and generally, Pragmatism is laziness (hmm...another article altogether). In reality, democracy is a form of social, or more specically governmental, darwinism (no caps for joo). It is a failed experiment. Even if we wanted to apply pragmatism, or rather, utility, one would never arrive at democracy.</p><p>The fact is: some opinions aren't worth as much as others. If half the population is stupid, do you really think that it is most &quot;useful&quot; to have that half of the population voting? Honestly, do you really believe people are equal? Justify it! I dare you. I cannot justify equality, it does not exist. Now, do I believe their is a bare minimum of value to humans, yes; but, I don't believe we are equal. Some are stronger than others, others smarter, others prettier, etc. And, no, don't buy into Humanism. It is garbage‚Äìit is philosophically unsound. Humanism exists in virtue of half-truths. Humanity for example, cannot have infinite value. Nor are we equal. But, you may argue we do have value.</p><p>Is it really &quot;for the best&quot; that Johnny boy over there has any corporate power? He is retarded. Even in the face of utility, it is stupid to let stupid people rule. Obviously, none of us deserve individual or corporate power. The next stage would be one of representation (but, obviously not democratically chosen, else the purpose is defeated). Smart, non-democratically chosen leaders that are qualified to lead would be better than some direct democracy. But, even this has its problems in utility. And, of course, the pragmatists would still be wondering, how would those leaders be chosen?</p><p>What ought the savvy person do? Obviously, corporate government is a failure.</p><p>It would seem to be there is only one answer: do the Will of God. Let God rule you. All else is meaningless. All is a question of value, and there is only one value to consider in this world: God's Will. If the masses fail to hear God, and they will, then let us do it individually. I can only be responsible for myself and my own. This isn't relativism, but I can certainly see why someone would think it is.</p><p>I've come to the fact that I trust the opinion of a very small minority of people on this planet (and usually only based on specific subject matters). I know none of us are qualified to answer all of these questions, but I think some have the right direction (which is transformational): the Will of God. Will I know or follow this? No. Will I try? Yes. I know democracy is an idiotic plan because there are so many idiots. I want whoever is closest to the Will of God to rule (God Himself perhaps?); and I want someone who wants whoever is closest to the Will of God. Essentially, I know the base answer, I think most don't, and it is because of that democracy fails.</p><p>In closing (which is sad, because I've not said much), I thought I would consider something slightly off topic.</p><p>I'm not in for Zen-BS, false-dichotomies, nor am I interested in supposed &quot;paradoxes&quot;. All is black and white, there is no equal. There is only absolute right, and all the rest is absolutely wrong. With that in mind, I still find myself amused by the ironies in 1984's mantra:</p><p>War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength</p><p>I come back to this statement over and over again. We are in trouble. Do you feel like a madman sitting in front of doomsday? Man, I do. I can appreciate Donnie Darko's laugh at the end.
