<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>As usual, I showed up early. I ran my perimeter sweep. All was quiet on the muddy front. An electrician needed to get into a panel, and I was the only one around who knew the code to the lock. I let him in. I wrote some in the car while waiting for Terry to show up. Jaye doesn't work on Fridays, no OT for him through the temp agency. </p><p>They arrived at 7:35. I said my good mornings and started working on the stand. </p><p>Terry asked me if I had ever worked with copper pipes. I said no. He then made fun of my school for not teaching this to me. He thought it was stupid I didn't learn that. I explained what I did learn. The old school stuff he said was useless (I'm surprised he had no respect for it though), since no engineer will trust us to make them anymore. I nodded. He eventually conceded, after hearing what I've learned, that I was studying general process pipefitting. Essentially, not every pipefitter uses copper. I don't know why he thinks a school would teach something so specialized. He wanted something to complain about, I think. </p><p>I told Terry I'd be getting some more tools soon. He responded by saying at least I have more tools than the other clowns that Barry and Ben hired. Lol. Jesus. The backhanded compliments are tiresome.</p><p>Terry continues to abruptly ignore me in the middle of a conversation, switching to Leroy out of the blue. It's straight up passive aggressive.</p><p>Terry asked me to build another stand for his section of pipe. So, I started in on it. I asked him if he wanted me to weld it. I explained that I could do the plate, just not a pipe. He said he wanted his son to have something to do. He also decided to have Jacob weld my pipe. </p><p>During the break, I took Leroy to the office. We both had to pick up our checks. Leroy didn't have direct deposit, and he has worked there for 5 years. He must not have a checking account or the basic financial literacy to do this. I am surprised. </p><p>I saw Terry, Jacob, and Leroy mount their long Victaulic pipe to the control valve on Chiller #2. They had to loosen every flange and bring out a 7' (I shit you not) pry bar to generate enough leverage to cheat their fuckup. It took a long time. I saw him mount the Victaulic gasket and binding. </p><p>Terry helped me move my Victaulic pipe into place and told me to set it up for fitting it up. He was taking a while, and I wanted to do it myself anyway. I had Leroy come help me fit it up. It was a tight fit, but it worked. By the time he came back, we were just tightening the remaining bolts. He looked surprised. Yeah, fuck you! I did the math and fitup for the entire run. Furthermore, mine doesn't look like shit with some ghetto cheats that can't be taken apart and put back together in any reasonable fashion.</p><p>We moved my double 90 flanged piece into position for the outlet on Chiller#1. He was going to save it for Monday, but we had time later in the day to fit it up. The fitup is very hard to do, and it's the most important part. It's why mine worked (minus the length on the last pipe needing adjustment, quickly solved out-of-position) and his didn't, taking a lot more back-breaking work. We can still see it's off too.</p><p>I saw his method of measurement. The guy literally eyeballed it. That takes some guts. I don't understand why, since there are other parts of his process which are extremely exacting, particularly for making it level and plumb on stands. </p><p>Travis burned himself soldering (sp?) the copper. I asked if I could learn from him. He said I'd need to ask his dad. His dad came, and I asked in front of Travis. His dad said, &quot;I don't care what you do.&quot; Jesus. I said I appreciated it.   </p><p>I finished cutting and making the stands. I even showed my welding to Jacob. He was clearly impressed. He thought I'd fall flat on my face because I can't fit like his dad. </p><p>We all fit up the double 90. It took a lot of work to get it right. It still feels off to me. In fact, the level showed it wasn't right on part of it, but something else feels wrong (I can't put my finger on it). Terry didn't mind the level issue, saying none of the others were correct. That, of course, is where he is wrong. My inlet, unlike his, was dead fucking on. This was an excuse for his previous work.</p><p>Terry said something remotely empathic today. He asked how long my trip back was, I told him. He was again taken back by it (we talked once before about it). He asked if I was paying rent, and I said yes. I think he actually felt bad for me for a second.</p></div>
