<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Dear <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">wr</sup></button></p><p>Wow. I'm taking forever to respond. All of my letters these days seem to take longer and longer to write. I don't understand why, but I'm gonna go with the flow. Some parts of my wiki just take way longer to reason about than others. {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>} is a prime example of a work that takes it out of me and requires months (or years, or even a lifetime) to write.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ab</sup></button> It is an interesting experience to draft openly, to know you likely read the drafting of this letter from time to time.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">vs</sup></button> It requires me to acknowledge that I say many things you already know. Drafting is set against a context and timeline which can be expensive to interpret, and you charitably connect the dots and fill in the gaps for me. Thank you, and thank you for waiting! Lol.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>At 13, I could barely imagine being 20, much less 24.
</p></blockquote><p>This sounds like I'm not treating you like a peer, like I'm patronizing you. Please forgive me. This is exactly what I tell my 13-year-old daughter (and myself). We have this discussion often as I attempt to reveal to her what it means to empathize with her <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a>. I cannot say I succeed on this front, and I consider both of you wildly more talented at your ages than I ever was. We can only ever guess given our predictive models.</p><p>This is one of my failings in {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Dreams.html">Dreams</a>}, imho. I don't think I've gotten any better at it either. Gonna have to dream about dreaming, I guess. It's very moving to me watching you plan on your wiki too. Watching all the rest of you (and many folks who have joined us) kick so much ass in planning has been humbling learning experience. I am grateful.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I cried myself to sleep in bed, wishing to be held, rocked, comforted; wanting to feel less alone and frightened.
</p></blockquote><p>You have elegantly made the point more than once in your wiki. It is my opinion that intense virtue-theoretic perceptual sensitivity (an emotional process at the bottom) is a sign of intelligence (at least half of it). Awareness is a double-edged sword. It's my experience that intelligence can be a painful burden.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ivs</sup></button> It is incredibly difficult to find other people who can even understand what you are saying, let alone finding people who would take the time listen, let alone finding people trustworthy enough to empathically interpret it with you in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>.</p><p>I'm honored to be someone who knows you to whatever <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> I do. I'm afraid I can't help you much with the fright (I think there are real monsters in the desert), but insofar as I can help it, you will not be alone. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I thought things would be different as an adult ‚Äì that the loneliness would dissolve and there would be no more tears or salt spots on my glasses. But crying in my bed, covers pulled over my head, feels no different today than it did 11 years ago.</p><p>The feelings are the same: I am wracked by sorrow, by an aching hole in my heart ‚Äì do you sense it? A tightness in my chest, a gap, an empty space, a void in my chest that is dark and terrible and sad. If you are deeply honest, my words resonate ‚Äì you have felt this hole in your own chest. Perhaps this is it: these visceral qualia form the most intense and common language between us all. Kicks, you describe your weeping and we feel it ‚Äì h0p3's stomach turns inside out as he writes to you and I recognize my own insecurities in your feelings of insignificance. As we read the words of Others, our bodies respond with the knowledge and recognition of our deep wounds, our brokenness, our despondence, our faith, our hopes, our excitement; all of our being resonates together.
</p></blockquote><p>That is well said. It is clear to me we all have an intense phenomenology. It is rare that I spend so much time poring over the exact same visceral words of others again and again. You both make me think and feel a great deal. I have few metaphors and experiences to compare it to.</p><p>Too much time has passed since I started writing this letter (as usual). Since then, I have been delighted to see your forest grow. You are branching out hard. It's amazing to see. =) </p><p>I enjoy watching you talk with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a>. Lurking is wonderful; it's my default mode (surprise!). In physical form, I'm able to low-effort signal that I'm paying attention and listening to others speak with each other, and sometimes I find a place to jump into the conversation train. Sometimes I have too much to expel to make it fit though. I don't have the chance to present even body language here. You know I'm reading what you say if I'm on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="m10.html">m10</a>, but that's only because you know me. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Others.html">Others</a> are unlikely to know because the reading and writing are so much more expensive compared to body language. Extremely cost-efficient decentralized signaling for lurk-participation seems difficult to achieve in hypertext. In any case, it's neat to see the growing rhizome.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I have said in the past that there is an unbridgeable gap between <em>my mind</em> and <em>other minds</em> ‚Äì what are you thinking? what thoughts are running through your mind as you read this? I cannot ever <em>truly</em> know. But I find a space here; we are all animals, and it stands to reason that despite our infinitely different contexts, the physically embodied feelings we experience are deeply common among us. We are all raw feeling in the desert together.
</p></blockquote><p>I will have to slow down here. I agree we can't be absolutely certain, but I think knowledge is usually about passing a probabilistic threshold of a universalizable standard of anti-luck justification particularized to a context. Beyond that, there is faith.</p><p>I'm not able to speak to whether or not we find ourselves in infinitely different contexts yet. I do not know; perspective and possibility is a hard problems. That may just be part of the definition of qualia. If it isn't infinite, it's clearly infeasible. I agree we share a great deal in common, and it is raw! </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>So ‚Äì I have felt today as I felt at 13, have spiraled into waves of grief and fear and sadness, seemingly without reprieve. If the world is still green and alive, I foresee myself diving into that well at 72. The fear of death will rise as a giant in front of me, the grief of losing friends and loved ones: pain, sadness, and fear. Nothing will have changed ‚Äì in my body I will feel as I have always felt, weeping desolately under the covers.
</p></blockquote><p>How much do you think our writing in our wikis is a result of the fear of death? I know my question is cliche, but cliches exist for a reason. I have not resolved this problem for myself. </p><p>Your sadness inspires <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a>. It's very human. I love that about your work. I'm unwilling to accept authenticity as a sufficient explanation of autonomy, but whatever is necessary and right about it shows up in spades in your self-modeling.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Behold - here again I find a space, a freedom, an ease. I am capable of surviving the deluge of feeling. It is a waterfall, roaring over me, and there I sit with the pain pounding through my head and the tension foaming in my heart. I am an adult, my frontal lobe has grown, self-awareness formed and nurtured, and I turn towards the waterfall and embrace it with all the gentle love and honesty in myself.
</p></blockquote><p>You clearly have a gentleness to you. I'm afraid I don't have much gentleness in me; it's not my instinct. I will think about how you do it. I know you don't hold your Tickler in high regard, but I'm grateful to have the chance to see even what you take to be a failed project. I think there is gentleness in it too.</p><p>Also, what you say reminds me of a technique <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a> uses to wash away immense pain. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>When I was 13, I longed eternally for someone to embrace me, to cradle me, to never let me go, to listen to me so intently, and to tell me that everything was going to be alright. Slowly, piece by snail-like-imperfect-piece, I have learned to hold myself. I sit with the waterfall and sit and sit and suddenly the storm has passed and I am alive. 
</p></blockquote><p>I can see your work on this topic clearly in your wiki (which isn't to say I have a full understanding). It's beautiful to see. I can also see the waves in you on your wiki. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Self-Dialectic.html">Self-Dialectic</a> and negotiating ourselves into the world is crazy hard work.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I have gently begun to heal. I am broken ‚Äì I will never not be broken ‚Äì our brokenness unites and connects us, our fragility, the Human condition. 
</p></blockquote><p>The entire section is too poetically beautiful for me to say &quot;preach, yo!&quot; But, I have no other way to say it. I'm in agreement with you. I feel the weight of that claim. </p><p>I aim to distance myself from gnosticism; the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Truth.html">Truth</a> and our modeling of it deserves to be sacrificially free. I do not know how unification works in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="end.html">end</a>. I'm convinced <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Other.html">The Other</a> is part of the completion we can achieve. I would argue that some unification principles are more unifying than others, not all unities/constitutions are equal, some notions are more complete than others, and some Human conditions are more resolvable than others. Fragility and obligations are very difficult.</p><p>I have said it multiple times, and I will say it again, I want to make sure I am useful to your flourishing. One of my precision problems is that I don't know what's worth measuring (and why). I don't know which hammers I'm supposed to use, and I'm often the sledgehammer when I should have been the deadblow or nylon. Sometimes I'm supposed to fix it entirely differently, and sometimes I shouldn't do anything.  </p><p>I am worried that brokenness does not always unite us. Sometimes our brokenness is what prevents the connection. I think a great deal is up to us though, so I will continue to try to figure out how to do it better.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>And as I hold space for myself, I hold space for others. I will sit with you, Kicks, and feel with you, resonate with you. You may wrestle with me, h0p3, and bump against a wound I did not even know existed, and I will be grateful for the opportunity to mend it. Us broken shards of pottery will totter on together as arm in arm we stitch ourselves and therefore the world together with golden thread.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">mm</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span>
</p></blockquote><p>Imagined! I love the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Golden%2520Rule.html">Golden Rule</a> thread.</p><p>We have cried a lot. I am worried that you are overwhelmed by this experience (it's overwhelming to me). </p><p>It's been interesting to see you reason about your diaries and the stories you have told yourself. I didn't have the discipline you did to take my thoughts seriously enough to write them down. In regret, I'm envious. I wish I could go back and redo that part of my life. Will you eventually transpose them into your private wiki?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><blockquote><p>We have cried a lot. I am worried that you are overwhelmed by this experience (it's overwhelming to me). </p></blockquote><p>We have indeed! I am okay with it. :) I've always just let it out ‚Äì my boyfriend has cried maybe twice in five years, according to him, and I can't relate to that. Crying clears the pipes out, is a cathartic release.</p><p>This experience does become overwhelming at times; I hibernate like a bear because of it and the rest of life sometimes.</p><p>I'm not sure how to end this! Cheers, Auf Wiedersehen, until our next communiqu√©!</p><p>sphygmus
</p></blockquote><p>I can relate to it. It has been work to learn the difference between shame of mere convention to be shed and morally necessary shame (empathy demands it). I was lucky to be raised by a feminist who forcibly enabled spaces for her boys to openly cry. Indeed, she was my mother in those contexts.</p><p>There is a beauty to sadness which I will never understand. I must say it again: I admire your sensitivity. It makes you human in the best way. I think it makes your vulnerability, trust, and courage all the more meaningful to me.</p><p>I think my cries are between barely able to hold it in as someone's sadness leaps into me to (thankfully rarer) ugly sobbing which silences the room. I am lucky to have family that will rub my back as I lose it. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#2018%20%E2%80%93%20Yearly%20Audit%3A%20Awareness%20Logs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#2018%20%E2%80%93%20Yearly%20Audit%3A%20Awareness%20Logs</a></p><p>not gonna lie, h0p3, ever since I've started writing to you I've been scared you would write the same thing to me that you wrote to kicks in <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://philosopher.life/#2018.12.13%20-%20kickscondor%3A%20Revelation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Revelation</a>, that I'm a relativist post-modern monster, and the more I post, the more evidence for you to point to in ripping me down. <br> ‚Äî not that I believe you would aim to rip me apart but fear is fear, and I risk it.
</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate that you aren't going to lie to me! I have heard more than one person say that to me. I know you aren't saying any of us are monsters (even when the fear is there). That letter was painful to write. It can be much easier to go through life without that integrity, and I'm honored you make the commitments and sacrifices to be honest. </p><p>I feel your fear (even from your first letter), and imho, it's not just with me.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button> I hope you can see I feel that fear myself with my own wiki too.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">f</sup></button> It is why I aim to practice <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> so thoroughly (which is not to say I have succeeded). Indeed, you do trust me a great deal. I do not take your vulnerability lightly.</p><p>To be clear, I am not convinced <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="kickscondor.html">kickscondor</a> is a full-blown postmodern relativist, and he's certainly not a monster. No, I respect <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="kicks.html">kicks</a>. I also think he spends his life quite wisely in being a teacher and librarian. Yes, we appear to have crucial fundamental disagreements, imho. I suggest he is undecided, but still thinking about it. Far too many moves he makes require faith in meaning; his constructions beg the question. Obviously, I don't think you are a relativist or a monster either; I think you prove that again and again. Do I see you wrestle with it? Yeah, I think so. So do I! Who doesn't face the meaninglessness monster? Faith is the hardest problem.</p><p>One important difference is that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="kicks.html">kicks</a> asked me to go this direction even after I have given warnings.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">rb</sup></button> I have tried to be as clear as I can. Deconstruction comes in varying degrees and kinds of violence in the dialectic. </p><p>We're forced to make judgments about people, including harsh ones. I do so openly, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="audit.html">audit</a>ably, and with as transparent a window into my identity as I can muster. I expect to be judged on my judgment. Indeed, I put a ferocious amount of work into how I seek the approval of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> (which is not to say I've done it well).</p><p>Our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="hyperconversations.html">hyperconversations</a> enable us to deconstructively get to the bottom of our differences rapidly, but they are also the constructions of languages, bonds, and meaning with each other too. I think there is objective meaning, and that is a difficult pill to swallow. It's my duty to defend it radically.</p><p>I deny the claim that all identities, points of view, memeplexes, ideas, algorithms, and meanings are unconditionally valid, real, equal, or justified; like every other person, I do have outgroups. It's true: I'm a man on a mission. That's what philosophy is like. I cannot say it is hedonically satisfying, but meaning is going to be something which doesn't boil down to mere chemical satisfaction conditions in my circuitry. </p><p>I say I am a <em>box of contradictions</em>, and I mean it dialectically. The coherentist (i.e. internalist) is going to say we need coherentify ourselves (to what standard, our own?). I think it takes active autonomous work to overcome a kind of epistemic entropy in us to begin with, but to go on to unify ourselves is radically harder work. Korsgaard is wrong about unity to any <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> alone being the answer (unless we're simply talking about the principle necessary for maximal unity). Many highly-integrated sociopaths are quite unified to a large extent. It is my problem with zen reasoning taken to its logical conclusions. My neighbor <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Gary.html">Gary</a> is a genius. He's a stunning man to speak with and a scholar of Daoism. In the end, he concedes to me there is no such thing as evil on his view (and I tell him that is evil too). Take him far down the epistemic path, and he'll deny realism as well (and I tell him that is not true either). I love talking with him even if he's profoundly wrong.</p><p>It reminds me of the first time I encountered <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="phenomenology.html">phenomenology</a>. My undergrad was strictly analytic to the point that only one history of philosophy course even covered the Continent (you got a much better education than I did). My gradschool friend <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="GB.html">GB</a>, who is skilled in both, explained his understanding of bracketing. My reply has always been that I cannot doubt intrinsic meaning because it halts the program.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">i</sup></button> I think postmodernism freezes us in doubt and prevents us from committing ourselves because we can never have the comfort of certainty our amygdalas so desperately desire. </p><p>Tangentially, we are all wrestling with the fact that being so public means we could all be ripped apart. I prepare for it in how I construct myself. We must deny and accept objective meanings <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a> (and we can only do our best). A world in which people aren't justifiably struggling with themselves and others to be accountably committed to each other all the way down, however painful it may be, will be the end of us.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#180815%20%E2%80%93%20Awareness%20Log%3A%20Digital%20Connection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#180815%20%E2%80%93%20Awareness%20Log%3A%20Digital%20Connection</a></p><p>And that's scary as fuck.

I applaud your bravery and honesty. Your character is not cheap. Yes, it is scary as fuck. =(</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Because this is something I really want? Or love? Or am passionate about? And if I expose myself to it - then I'm opening up a tender place in myself...
</p></blockquote><p>You are never going to be able to completely prevent exposure, imho. I think still you maintain significant control over how you make yourself vulnerable in this way. I can appreciate how tender it is.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Because I'm scared that it will all be for nothing, right? Because what if this is pointless? This wiki, a personal website, a blog, the IndieWeb? What if it comes to nothing? What if it means absolutely nil in the long term scheme of things? Worse, perhaps - what if it is actively evil? Makes us as humans worse? Brings us down, denigrates us?
</p></blockquote><p>This is a crucial problem you continue to face (we all do). Answering your own questions logically requires you to put your tentpegs down on definitions of meaning, objective evil, and what it means to make a human worse. That is the rabbithole in the desert.</p><p>You might Pascal's wager your way through this one. If it really means nothing, then you've not meaningfully lost anything by having assumed meaning. If everything is absurd by definition, then you've not done anything incoherent (you've maintained truth preservation) in deducing whatever you wish (or, who cares if you weren't coherent anyway?).</p><p>This is an issue of faith. Does this matter? Even if this is a simulation, is it real enough to be meaningful? </p><p>I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> it doesn't make us worse humans. I'm convinced our wikis are political action. Doing the right thing might have no effect outside us. I can say that my wiki has profoundly affected many of the relationships in my life. Of course, there is only so much up to us.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>And I suppose another fear is that everything digital is just a scam and by its nature is inherently &quot;less-than&quot;. Just pure &quot;less-than&quot; the world out here, the world where there's clouds in the sky and physical touch and words in my ears and facial expressions. The world of dirt in my hands and growing green things. That the two are antithetical and incompatible with each other.
</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps. I can say that the most important stories have always been with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a>, both in reading, watching, and in person. You make an excellent point in <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#Offline%20vs.%20IRL" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Offline vs. IRL</a>. Let me continue to extend the internalist's argument here: if waking life, the ego tunnel, is itself just a simulation, an experienced model of a model of the thing-in-itself, then what privileges that simulation over other kinds of simulations?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">priv</sup></button> Shaking your hand in real life or cryptographically shaking your hand online both have real meaning. </p><p>We have evolved to be creatures that emotionally, gutturally, blink-of-an-eye, virtue-theoretically, ready-to-hand, fastmind, system 1, lizardbrain perceive and algorithmically react to the world presented to us. Many people find their lives become hedonically worse when they are start reading, listening, studying, and even just addictively using the interwebs (though that is not a good enough reason, in my view, to not engage in the behavior). This is enough so that interactions inside of a classroom will often be superior to remote classrooms simply due to the social vulnerability, but there appear to be cases in which digital classrooms have the upperhand.  Vulnerability, of course, can exist in digital spheres as well to some extent, especially when the story of who we were is recorded in such a way that it lasts longer than the ephemeral classroom. In a way, we have not evolved to be efficient emotional reasoners in digital spheres.</p><p>I think our almost entirely digital relationship is as real as any of the offline relationships I have. The proof of it sits in my wiki. Sad as it may sound, you clearly know me better than almost anyone I've ever met. I cannot doubt it. </p><p>I need to start saying &quot;offline&quot; instead of &quot;IRL&quot; too.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">irl</sup></button> It's exceedingly correct.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#190219%20%E2%80%93%20weaving%3A%20*waves" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#190219%20%E2%80%93%20weaving%3A%20*waves</a>*</p><p>hey h0p3!</p><p>just wanted to leave you a quick note ‚Äì I haven't checked my signal messages in a bit because I've been avoiding myself and other people recently.

Thank you!</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Part of my hesitation for creating a &quot;Recently Released&quot; tab is that ‚Äì I'm not sure I want to highlight everything new I release for everyone to see.

</p></blockquote><p>That's cool. Ol'voldy makes sense. This is something that I, as a user, can solve for myself. I'm actually kind of growing fond of the idea of &quot;stumbling&quot; upon it too. That is not an experience I get to have often on your wiki because I've been reading from the beginning. So, I'm cool if you make it convenient, and I'm cool if you allow me to have that mystery too.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I'm not sure how to answer the question of usefulness. I worry that it is too reductive, the opposite of expansiveness. I suppose I also conflate &quot;useful&quot; with &quot;practical&quot; and I'm hesitant with that word too. This may be wrong, but I worry that in being useful or practical, one becomes mere means, rather than an end.
</p></blockquote><p>I should begin by agreeing that I'm not certain how to answer the question of usefulness either. It's a hard problem that only gets bigger for me as I examine it. </p><p>Oh, I really dislike that word &quot;practical.&quot; Yeah, I hear you, sister. The amount of evil carried out in the name of what is practical is not ideal (but, the amount of evil carried out in not being practical <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a> appears to include all immorality). It makes me cringe so much, but I'm trying to learn to wield it. I despise the fact that when I hear most people use (:P) the words &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;practical,&quot; part of me wants to puke.</p><p>You may already know what I think here, but I'm obligated to say it. I must challenge the claim &quot;that in being useful or practical, one becomes mere means, rather than an end.&quot;  I do so with the utmost respect for what you are after here, imho. I think you are after the spirit of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a>, hedged-conversative in how you create a buffer to make sure you do not cross the actual line (it's too bright to even see!). Thus, I disagree like an annoying, hypocritical nitpicker. It's important to me to continue to communicate it with increasing clarity.</p><p>When we serve others, they use us. We are means to their ends, and sometimes necessarily so. Instrumental reasoning (hypothetical imperatives) often conceptually requires we use others as means, but those maxims will not be categorical if we use others as <em>mere</em> means. Morally using others with respect is fundamental to building civilization. I suggest morally justified causal relationships among persons would be impossible without this distinction between means and mere means. </p><p>As for an illustration, imagine asking me to pass the butter because my existence in that context only matters, in your eyes, in virtue of the utility I grant you by passing you the butter. That's mere means. When you ask me to pass the butter, you can use me and my limbs as means while still respecting my personhood. </p><p>OOO makes this harder. I'm a differentiationist. I believe there are some objects which have no subjective point of view, and I believe some subjects carry more moral weight than others. The rock, to my eyes, is just a thing, an object which can only ever be mere means (barring some miracle). I think the subjective perspective of the average human carries more moral weight than the beetle. I am not convinced all subjective points of view are equal in some respects either, and this makes <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> a very difficult problem. Some Kantians believe lying to your dog is wrong not because the dog is the rightsbearer, but because we owe it to ourselves not to be liars. I am not so convinced by that. </p><p>Further, this becomes complicated by what counts as evil agency. To say Hitler had an invalid identity means his desires and beliefs should weigh differently into our intersubjective determination of what we ought to do. For most of the timeslices of Hitler's life, I don't believe he deserved to live. There are some who deny Hitler is even an agent at all. I am not so convinced by that.</p><p>Lastly, like Saint Aristotle, I do not know how to talk about the unification of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, including what it means to say we aren't mere means to it. I think my endedness is primarily and probably only ever a result of that origin and destination. This is not a problem I know how to solve or reason about effectively enough. Taking up positions in contextualism and modality are my current approaches.</p><p>Your worries are excellent ones! They turn me inside and out. In any case, I intend to ask myself how I can be useful to others as obligated by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a>. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This seems directly related to the idea of &quot;milleniel burnout&quot; from my 190219 ‚Äì trail: dissonance today. I don't think the author points to (at least one of) the real issue(s) underlying the exhaustion described: that postmodern doubt and sense of utter meaninglessness.
</p></blockquote><p>I feel it. It feels a little bit like LOTR to me where the hardest battles seem to come when they are most exhausted, depleted of resources, etc. </p><p>I suggest the denial of the intrinsic value of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a> which can sometimes result from the relative meaninglessness of postmodernism  enables savvy dark-triads to exploit others in capitalism,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pn</sup></button> reinforcing that burnout and hyperreality of meaninglessness.

I think it's the only viable dialectical response to postmodernism. Postmodernism is gorgeously deconstructive. I am, yet again, forced to admit the necessity of faith. Indeed, I have terrorized myself with uncertainty. The pursuit of truth is a risk.</p><p>Also, I have some TW shoptalk sitting in queue here:</p><ul><li>I didn't see anyone in Discord offer a method for exporting a wiki based upon tags.

Or, maybe it's like picking up a pile of dogshit with gloves: you know it's there, but you at least some reason not to freak out.
