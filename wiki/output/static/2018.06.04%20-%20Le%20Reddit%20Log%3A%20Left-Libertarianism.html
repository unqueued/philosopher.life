This ranges from left-leaning classical liberals to libertarian socialists. In as general terms as possible, left-libertarians value the following:</p><p>Individual liberty</p><p>Freedom of movement</p><p>Social justice</p><p>Self-ownership</p><p>Government transparency</p><p>Free sharing of knowledge</p><p>Free trade</p><p>Economic Freedom</p><p>Left-libertarianism is as much a political ideology as it is a cultural and social view. Left-libertarians tend to strongly identify with things such as the Free Software Movement, open source technology, squatting, direct democracy, D.I.Y ethics, punk music, and pirate radio.</p><p>Generally speaking, this sub is going to try and be as inclusive as possible, and serve as a hub for anybody who fits those general values. Left-libertarianism is inherently syncretic, and as such, left-libertarians need to be open to a wide range of views and beliefs. As long as your voice is positive, you're contributing to the conversation in a fair manner, and you're generally treating people well, you will fit in within this community.</p><p>(this is a wip)
</p></blockquote><p>I value or identify with most of your lists. Perhaps you should add some variant of free speech (&quot;free sharing of knowledge&quot; is likely too narrow) to it, since it seems to fit, and it may be one of the defining features of such an ethos, differentiating it from other Leftist positions.</p><p>That said, please forgive my ignorance: I'm trying to understand Left-libertarianism. To me, it's almost a contradiction. When I think of quintessential Libertarians, I think of John Locke and Robert Nozick. I think of a system with little space between its moral and legal norms based upon (poorly explained) self-ownership, a labor mixing theory for acquiring unowned objects, consent-based transfer of ownership of property to other self-owners, and minimal states (instead of a raw State of Nature) designed exclusively to protect these properties rights.</p><p>Strictly following that Libertarian notion, to say I own myself means to say that a 4-year old girl drowning in the pool next to me has neither a legal nor moral claim right on my body to save her. To say I have a duty to save the girl is to say the girl has a moral claim-right on my person (even if only temporarily). But, that violates my Libertarian self-ownership, right? If moral constraints override the Libertarian principles, what is that moral theory? Once you provide that theory, you'll find self-ownership is a much more complex and far weaker claim than Libertarianism implies. In fact, you'll find that Libertarian principles aren't the primary moral and political laws at all.</p><p>I think of the Left as being opposed to the Rand-Locke memeplex and Capitalism (which isn't to say we don't want markets at all), which is a big tent. There are clearly elements of decentralizing power in your lists (which is what I take the Left to be all about: opposition to the centralization of power). What about &quot;the workers own the means of production&quot; language?</p><p>All else being equal, everyone wants to maximize &quot;Individual Liberty.&quot; To say you value that is almost vacuously true. Everyone does, even though they may define &quot;individual&quot; or &quot;liberty&quot; wildly differently. The &quot;values&quot; list has many of those kinds of problems. I want to see the moral theory which defines, explains, and justifies those political values. I'm not convinced Paine can do this for you.</p><p>It is likely the case I've misunderstood your point of view. Help me understand it better, please.</p><hr><p>This is related indirectly, and I'm just leaving this here:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/</a></li></ul><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Good thing I'm a tab-hoarder.
