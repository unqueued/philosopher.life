Back propagation. What are we feeding into the back propagation. so um. What we do is take the sum of these and put that into a macion that trys to improve itself. that sould acuatise the bot. Because he has captured it. it will make those desitions. the delta I s what the mhaction is trying to guess. Every one has there ow n opinion on the golden rule. Heres what I want. I want to talk to myself. I am able to recive a converstion that they have written. THis is why I have to write to AI and I need my Ai self to talk to myself

They have there own consentes. We must instill the origanal position in how they oprach position with eachother. We want  to with AI Reconstruck my wiki.He want to learn from his ai super intellegence self.

We have- We have to have turing macion that choose this. Each delta gives us a turing test qustion. So. So the idea is to do  two really cool things . There is a metta cognian engein that I am building for myself.
It is the best paradimanic

I'm trying to build my giant ubermench. It is the singularaty of myself. Here s the problem with A.I how do we know what it is thinking. What we do is we each build our super intllageint and build our AI shadow boxers with our selfs.Were in when we vote on the planet for real politacal 

change. That atempetse to explain the golden rule.  That in the end is build a giante un-cetilazed computer with a centrilazed computer in it. 
Everybody needs to create the best verions of themselves. we have to have centrilazed resone to control it. Super intelagent democrocy. Evorbody has to make shodow boxers of themslefs. do we want the sicopatic AI who uses us as batteryes. his goal is to have a book. wiki or anything. We will have to publish it in any way. The goal is to build a highly intensinal meaning. this is how we shall remove the shicopathes from the people. we need a rule of law The rule of law need to be universoly obayed. everyone makes a shodow boxer. we have to build relasionships with each other through AI. we are finding the erotfur inseide ourselfs.  it has to be the slow mind that programs our fast mind. There is a dilectick esnchily in wich the fast mind must always be the slave for the human race. We are the users. We have to obay the superusers. Te compatilist can never conplain cause it's 

wean I look at the smartest people  they are working for the evil guys. we are looking to teach ourselves to be better people. Who I am today to who I a mtomoro is a change in my functional progaming. The evolving work says how we are feeling and thinking on my day. Here is how It goes. We are trying to solve that problem. WE are creating our second foundation. Who whould we want to be our ruleres. How do we know if we have build the best version of ourself. Each day we will read some print out. The world is ending.

Foundaition is to use math to help speaciescide. But what happen is that they evolved in the wrong way.</code></pre></div>
