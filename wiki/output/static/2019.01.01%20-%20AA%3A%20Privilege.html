TUE 9:25 AM
Also, thank you for both books =). My math kits are ready now.
TUE 9:43 AM
(for now...duh duh duh)
TUE 9:43 AM
I learned a lot from last years classes ‚Äîhow to balance relationships with teaching content ‚Äîor at least I feel like I grew there. I also feel like I spend more days out of the hole than in it ...I would like to keep growing in both!
TUE 11:19 AM
Happy New Year! And I am glad we have reconnected‚Äîwant to continue growing with that too
TUE 11:20 AM
How‚Äôs your year been? What do you hope for the next one?
TUE 11:21 AM
Yeah, trying to balance life and climbing out of the hole. I don't think I could have said that better, lol.
TUE 11:23 AM
Any particular relationships vs teaching content examples stand out to you?
TUE 11:23 AM
I don't know what I think about 2018 just yet. I'm still thinking about it.
TUE 11:23 AM
I am elated to have reconnected with you too. I appreciate your ability and choice to empathize. I keep running into that in my audits. There aren't many people in my life that literally ask me how I'm doing. Thank you.
TUE 11:25 AM
I was given the ‚Äúprivilege ‚Äú last year to have the administrator‚Äôs grandson fir two classes. He has a reputation for causing teachers to rethink teaching and his grandmother tends to side with him...
TUE 11:25 AM
Turnover in teaching is at a record high too.
TUE 11:25 AM
That sounds like a perfect storm, lol.
TUE 11:26 AM
I made it through the year and built a relationship with him and was able to teach content... to the point where this year his mom came to me and said they missed me.
TUE 11:26 AM
Success. =)
TUE 11:27 AM
I bet you are likely the only teacher to have had that impact with the brat.
TUE 11:27 AM
I think it‚Äôs just balance and not falling for the things that he threw out there to distract or disable
TUE 11:28 AM
A couple of years ago ‚ÄîI would have taken the bait and it would have been bad
TUE 11:30 AM
I am interested with how you and yours are doing :blush: (love u :heart:) and I enjoy getting your messages throughout the day
TUE 11:32 AM
I love you too, Aunty [[AA]]. =)
TUE 11:32 AM
It‚Äôs also helped me make better choices with my girls‚Äîlistening to their interests and options and not trying to impress my own on them
TUE 11:33 AM
I hope to follow your lead. You're trailblazing for me here (thank you).
TUE 11:34 AM
The kids are officially one year old today. I have a teenage girl now. Lol.
TUE 11:34 AM
older*
TUE 11:35 AM
Oooo I forgot it‚Äôs bday time! Happy Birthday to both of them! ü•≥:birthday:
TUE 11:35 AM
Teenage girls ‚Äîfull of hormones and no idea how to handle them... weeee
TUE 11:36 AM
I'm still thinking about how I want to answer the questions about last year and the coming. I'm working on my monthly and yearly [[Log Audit]]s today (and probably tomorrow) for my each [[Directory]]. I'm taking a retirement snapshot of those pages too (since proving my growth in them has mattered to me). After that, I should be in a position to write my 2019 resolution in {[[Dreams]]}.
TUE 11:38 AM
Good deal! I will read it there
TUE 11:38 AM
Telling, re-telling, and planning to tell myself the stories of myself is the dealio for now.
TUE 11:38 AM
I appreciate that. Thank you. If you want me to write differently in it, let me know. You're  a Root User (https://philosopher.life/#Root%20Users) whenever you want.
TUE 11:43 AM
That's one of my [[FTO]] goals. I want to listen (even if it's bad news) to those who clearly have been listening to me. It's part of the [[T42T]].
TUE 11:44 AM
I am better at analyzing numbers not words ‚Äîyou do so well at expressing yourself. I get to learn new words and concepts too...growing is good
TUE 11:47 AM
How are [[UJ]] and [[AG]] doing?
TUE 1:02 PM
Good good ‚Äîwe are all just lazing around. Today is my last day off.
TUE 1:24 PM
Playing Pok√©mon Let‚Äôs Go hehe
TUE 1:25 PM
That sounds excellent. =)
