MON 1:09 PM
Up and down‚Äîschool is good :blush:
MON 1:10 PM
We got new floors ordered
MON 1:12 PM
for the school or house?
MON 1:12 PM
House ‚Äîtan carpet is the bane of my life
MON 1:12 PM
Lol, yeah. What you going for?
MON 1:13 PM
Vinyl wood planks ‚Äîwater and pet proof but they look nice
MON 1:14 PM
That is exactly what I'd want too.
MON 1:14 PM
Image attached to message
MON 1:14 PM
That looks like real wood.
MON 1:14 PM
Yeah they are nice
MON 1:15 PM
Hopefully it will help with the look and smell of the house. Gonna work through each room
MON 1:15 PM
That is shockingly real looking, lol. I've never it like that.
MON 1:15 PM
Divide and conquer. [[AA]] the Conqueror.
MON 1:16 PM
They aren‚Äôt sticky ‚Äîthey click like wood floor
MON 1:16 PM
huh
MON 1:17 PM
neat
MON 1:17 PM
Image attached to message
MON 1:24 PM
Hoping it looks as nice as this
MON 1:25 PM
Lol, yeah. That is sick.
MON 1:26 PM
It will help the house a lot ‚Äîeasier to keep clean
MON 1:26 PM
Yes. I strongly prefer non-carpet.
MON 1:29 PM
Won‚Äôt hold the pet smell or dander as much
MON 1:30 PM
I also like to slide. Get a good running start and try to stop just before you hit the wall.
MON 1:37 PM
Granted, I am 100 pounds heavier now. What could go wrong!?
MON 1:37 PM
Rolling and sliding things are just better on those floors too. I will pay the softness and even heating price for a flat floor. I really hate our apartment's carpet.
MON 1:39 PM
How long you think it's going to take to install?
MON 1:40 PM
Yeah I used to like to slide too... but then I used to roller skate and have learned that my center of gravity has shifted but my reflexes are not adjusting...
MON 1:40 PM
I'm straight up too scared to rollerskate at any serious speed now. I only did it to convince my children they should try it.
MON 1:41 PM
Dunno ‚Äîwe would like to start in the bedrooms because we would like to move a wall in the main room
MON 1:41 PM
Getting old sucks :blush:
MON 1:41 PM
lol
MON 1:41 PM
Yeah, I'm having a hard time coming up with positives.
MON 1:42 PM
:face_with_rolling_eyes:
MON 1:42 PM
lol
MON 1:42 PM
Your neural pathways start to crystallize, you've built/habituated the algorithms in your limbic system that enable you to not have to worry/think about/see a bunch of stuff. If you do it right (as in encode wisdom in your identity effectively enough), it should cut out the noise and leave you pure signal. Age is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for having the hardware+software construction necessary for the virtuous perception.
MON 1:44 PM
Basically, age can possibly give rise to energy-efficient reasoning about how to be wise in many circumstances.
MON 1:44 PM
That's one.
MON 1:45 PM
Ok I will take that as a positive
MON 1:45 PM
[[k0sh3k]] means more to me each year. That is a kind of existential capital to me.
MON 1:47 PM

MON 1:47 PM
I have many times been wrong about what is meaningful (to various [[dok]]). That one becomes deeper (mind-bendingly for me).
MON 1:48 PM
The worth of loved ones ‚Äîchildren and husband or at least the understanding of worth deepens each year for me
MON 2:09 PM
Agreed!
MON 2:10 PM
That Aurelius dude said: &quot;A person's worth is measured by the worth of what he values.&quot; In this sense, I think age improves my sense of self-worth.
MON 2:10 PM
Also more self-reflections ‚Äîsome of which are not pleasant
MON 2:12 PM
preach, lol
MON 2:12 PM
I am just reaching the place where I can self-evaluate and doin something about it instead of just evaluating and falling deeper in the pit
MON 2:21 PM
Sigh fat finger typos
MON 2:21 PM
I am indebted to your pit analogy. The paralysis through analysis without synthesizing a solution is my problem too. I can tell you have been climbing out. Your courage is inspiring to me. I am grateful to have the chance to climb out of the pit with you. You give me a foothold here, discuss the strategy for that section of the climb there, and listen. I have been paying very close attention (the threads in my wiki are there). You have been rooting for me, and I will never forget it.
MON 2:24 PM
I can only hope to repay you.
MON 2:24 PM
I appreciate your understanding and listening without judgement. It is good to have a climbing partner that cheers with you as you reach a new level and is encouraging when you slip...
