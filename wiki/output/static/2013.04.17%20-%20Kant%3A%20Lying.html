<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My number one issue in this reading: Kant doesn’t seem to effectively address how far we can particularize our maxims. That’s what I need to know. Nothing else matters if I don’t have a standard for this. The system fails without this. Today’s topic demonstrates this problem over and over.</p><p>My second issue: How do we resolve the appearance of contradictory duties? A lot of the problems seem to have two competing duties. An effective decision procedure must explain the priority of duties or demonstrate how they aren’t really competing at all.</p><p>Truthfulness is one’s duty to everyone, no matter the circumstance.1 If we did lie, we may not be doing anything directly wrong to the one who unjustly compels us, but we would be doing wrong “in general.” This general sense would result in ‘no one believing anyone’s statements,’ and would cause contracts to lose their force, which is a key wrong against humanity in general, I guess. Why should I agree contracts are so important? Why should we think that someone willing to lie in this exact circumstance would really be damaging the general belief of statements? I don’t see it. This is a particular circumstance, not a general one.</p><p>Truthfulness is a duty which is the basis of all duties grounded on contract, “the law of which is made uncertain and useless if even the least exception to it is admitted.”2 Why should I agree to this? I have some intuitions which go this direction, but it is far from certain.</p><p>I fear I’ve not understood 8:427. If you lie, Kant says you legally accountable for the actions of the person to whom you lied. Maybe in his day, but our laws are more complex and take into account other morally salient features of a circumstance. Further, why should I care? This section seems to go against the very motivational claims underlying the good will. Unintended consequences – isn’t this the problem with consequentialist law? Let’s say a guy tells the lie, and remains responsible, and it just so happens, completely coincidentally, to turn the world into a utopia directly because of this lie. Is he responsible for turning the world into a utopia? He’d be responsible for bad, so why not good?</p><p>It is unclear to me that the Kingdom of Ends would need a Republic government. I’m fairly persuaded that “no human being can be bound except through laws to the formation of which he has contributed,” without the representative clause, has a real chance of being correct.3 Kant’s explanation of law and politics remains very confusing to me.</p><p>Kant very much favors honesty. What does Kant think of deception through omission? It isn’t honest, if you ask me. He talks about avoidance (8:428 and elsewhere). There seem to be cases where deception through omission is a hell of a lot like lying and quite dishonest, and cases where they aren’t a like. How does he disentangle these? I’m not sure he can.</p><p>Kant needs to establish the duty of truthfulness (unconditionally, in all cases, etc.). Show me how the CI generates this duty. I don’t believe it. We have yet to see the CI in action; it is not alive and working for me yet. This is a perfect opportunity to show how it works. This also seems like a simple test. If we cannot even do this, then the CI is this thing my reason commands but I know not what it really is, how it works, or why I should think it applies. The reasoning before did juice my intuitions that he’s right about the CI, but I need more than theory – I need to see that it works, and it really does need to live up to certain intuitions I have. Ultimately, I worry this “apodictic” law built into my reason by definition (bordering on ad hoc at this point) is not practical at all, but merely theoretical, and it is wildly unclear how a rational person (as we, not Kant, use the term) could use the CI as an effective moral decision procedure.</p><p>Kant offers a borderline ad hominem argument (oddly acceptable in moral arguments).4 I am already a liar because I’m thinking about exceptions to truthfulness. But, I say: I am not making an exception of myself – I think all people in the murderer circumstance should lie. If Kant does not turn to a moderate version of particularism, I think he focuses on the unconditional at loss of the practical, morally salient features of ethical life.</p><p>In 4:422, we get the suicide example. Problematically, it seems like he points out contrary examples later. If you had rabies or you were a POW with state secrets, etc., then suicide is permissible. How do we resolve this? Why can’t we do this for lying?</p><p>Kant gives us the lying promise example –this is about self-love. Many people can already agree to this. The murder example is very different –it seems to be about loving others (a far cleaner motive). Kant doesn’t seem to be able to account for this as nicely as I’d like.</p><p>From the Formula of the Law of Nature, one might be tempted to argue that “if everyone lied, then lying wouldn’t succeed it deceiving a murderer because the murderer wouldn’t believe what anyone had to say.” This is ridiculous. Surely we can see that it isn’t a matter of “Lying in all cases” vs. “Never lying in any cases,” but rather, “Almost never lying, except in a few certain cases” – and the murderer would believe us in that context. There is no contradiction or inconceivability here.</p><p>From the second formulation, Formula of Humanity, one might be tempted to say that we are treating the murderer as merely a means and not an end via manipulation/lying. This isn’t clear to me though. The soon-to-be murderer is about to do something very immoral, irrational – perhaps I’m helping him. Merely reminding him of his duty might not help. Lying might help.</p><p>Murder is complicated. It is an ultimate, irrevocable kind of evil action. There are reasons, I assume, why people believe it is okay to kill in self-defense or the defense of others. How does Kant deal with this? Is he an absolute pacifist? Instead of killing the would-be murderer, perhaps lying would be a lesser evil that gets the same job done. We want to try to do everything possible before we have to kill the murderer, right? This seems like I’m treating the murderer as an end. I want the best for them. If I was in a murderous rage, I hope someone would treat me like that too. From the objective perspective, I hope someone would lie to me!</p><p>Kant says we can’t intentionally say something which isn’t true, even good-naturedly.5 What about a joke or a prank?</p><p>Inner lies are complicated and unclear. The examples need clarification before I offer more thoughts. I fear that Kant did not have our understanding of human psychology, and without that benefit, he may make claims that he otherwise wouldn’t if he had modern science.</p><p>1 8:425</p><p>2 8:427</p><p>3 8:427</p><p>4 8:430</p><p>5 6:430</p><hr><p>‘On a Supposed Right to Lie from Philanthropy’ (pp. 8:425-30)</p><p>Groundwork (pp. 4:421-4, 429-31)</p><p>Metaphysics of Morals (pp. 6:429-31)</p><p>Critique of Practical Reason (pp. 5:67-71)</p><p>Hill: ‘Kantian Constructivism as Normative Ethics’ [on blackboard]</p><p>‘On a Supposed Right to Lie from Philanthropy’ (pp. 8:425-30)</p><p>8:425, Benjamin Constant: We have a duty to tell the truth to those who have a right to the truth.

Kant thinks Constant should talk about truthfulness.</p><p>are we authorized (right) to be untruthful?</p><p>Is it our duty to lie in unjust circumstances of coercion, where we may be preventing murder, etc.?</p><p>This is matter of duty of right, not of ethics (from footnote). ??</p><p>Truthfulness is one’s duty to everyone, no matter the circumstance. If we did lie, we may not be doing anything directly wrong to the one who unjustly compels us, but we would be doing wrong “in general.” This general sense would result in ‘no one believing anyone’s statements,’ and would cause contracts to lose their force, which is a key wrong against humanity in general, I guess.

I don’t see it. This is a particular circumstance, not a general one.</p><p>What does Kant think of deception through omission? It isn’t HONEST, if you ask me. He talks about avoidance (8:428 and elsewhere). I assume that’s fine. But, is it really? There seem to be cases where deception through omission is a hell of a lot like lying (and others that are very distance from lying). How does he disentangle these?</p><p>It is not necessarily harm to an individual, but it is necessarily harm to humanity in general. Why does a lie make the “source of right unusable?” Because the source of right is a contract?? I don’t know.</p><p>8:427, if you lie, Kant says you legally accountable for the actions of the person to whom you lied. Maybe in his day…But, even so, why should I care? This section seems to go against the very motivational claims underlying the good will.

Constant’s argument going “no human being can be bound except through laws to the formation of which he has contributed,” (8:427) may be correct, without the representative clause.</p><p>We all have the right and duty to truthfulness.</p><p>8:429, to generate a principle of politics we must provide: (1) an axiom issuing from external right; (2) a postulate of external public law in accordance with principle of equality; (3) a problem of how it is to be arrange in a society, in accordance with principle of equality and freedom.</p><p>“Right must never be accommodated to politics, but politics must always be accommodated to right.”</p><p>Kant needs to establish the duty of truthfulness (unconditionally, in all cases, etc.). Show me how the CI generates this duty. I don’t believe it. We have yet to see the CI in action; it is not alive yet. This is a perfect opportunity to show how it works. This seems like a simple test. If we cannot even do this, then the CI is this thing my reason commands but I know not what it really is, how it works, how it applies, or why I ultimately should care if I cannot cognize and use it.</p><p>I’m almost pissed off. This apodictic law built into my reason by definition (bordering on ad hoc at this point) is not practical at all, merely theoretical, and it is wildly unclear how a rational person (as we, not Kant use the term) could use the CI as an effective decision procedure. I’m hungry for answers; where are they? =)</p><p>I am deeply persuaded by some fundamental Kantian metaethical positions. But, I don’t think this system, so far, works. And, if it does, it seems like it boils down to particularism.</p><p>8:430, ad hominem! I am already a liar because I’m thinking about exceptions to truthfulness. I am not making an exception of myself – I think ALL people in that circumstance should lie. Kant focuses on the unconditional to loss of the practical, morally salient features of ethical life.</p><p>Groundwork (pp. 4:421-4, 429-31)</p><p>4:421, First applicable form of the moral principle (in 4:402), Formula of the Law of Nature</p><p>4:422, Suicide example, it seems like he points out contrary examples later. If you had rabies or you were a POW with state secrets, etc. How do we resolve this? Why can’t we do this for lying?</p><p>Lying promise example – note this is about self love. Many people can already agree to this, their intuitions go that way. The murder example is very different –it seems to be about loving others (a far cleaner motive).</p><p>Particularize your maxims to prevent conflicting duties, to match our intuitions, and to make this practical. This is his only out. His theory is incoherent if he doesn’t take it.</p><p>We can’t argue this: “ After all, if everybody lied, even just to murderers at the door enquiring about the whereabouts of one’s actions, then the lying could not succeed since no murderer would believe what one says, and hence the action violates the first form of the Categorical Imperative (CI)”</p><p>Surely we can see that it isn’t “Lying in all cases” vs. “Never lying in any cases,” but rather, “Almost never lying, except in a few certain cases” – and the murderer WOULD believe us in that context.</p><p>This discussion has been too one-dimensional. What we really have here seems to be conflicting duties. Kant can’t have any conflicts issue from the CI, but this is a case where, to our intuitions, it must.</p><p>4:429, Second formulation, Formula of Humanity</p><p>Means, ends treating.</p><p>Same 2 examples from before.</p><p>Consider: “Likewise, the lie violates the second form of the CI by failing to respect the rationality of the murderer, since that rationality is exhibited through the self-legislation of ends whereas by lying we manipulate the murderer into actions directed at our own end, which end is opposed to the end that the murderer has legislated for herself;  thus, the liar fails to treat the murderer as an end.”</p><p>Treating the murderer as a merely a means.
