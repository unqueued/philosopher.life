<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What do you like most about yourself?</h2><p>Hrmmm, so many things to choose from: probably my unlimited humility. =)</p><p>Note, of course, there is difference between &quot;what I like about myself&quot; and &quot;what I should like about myself.&quot; But, being the positive nihilist I am, I'm fine collapsing the distinction for now. Also, I think my choice answers both questions just fine.</p><p>Lastly, I'm not entirely sure what I am, who I am, or if I'm comprised of multiple minds. I definitely have competing intuitions. There are also significant metaphysical problems to persistent identity as well. That said, I think I'm allowed to do some handwaving here and &quot;just answer the question,&quot; right? </p><p>What I like most about myself: my use of my intelligence, particularly in the pursuit of wisdom and happiness. I am a philosopher, and I love that about myself. I'm not ashamed to say it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> I like thinking. I love thinking. I need it. I pursue truth and happiness through reason (and hope they aren't mutually exclusive). I desperately seek to know and be moved by what is most relevant and valuable about reality. I really wouldn't be me without constantly engaging in that activity. Obviously, I'm far from perfect. Depending on how you consider causality and responsibility (and, of course, anyone seeking to take me down a peg or two would take up a particular view here), you could easily say I've never fulfilled my potential. </p><p>I've built a life around thinking. It is part of the telos of humanity (which I take up as faith, despite obviously skeptical responses to my dubious claim here), if not the means to our true telos (eudaimonia). It's what I hope to improve. It's what I hope to use to make my life not only worth living, but also as good as it can be. </p><p>Spending my time trying to be intelligent and wise (a particular kind of intelligence) is useful and I like to think even intrinsically valuable in itself. There is a profound aesthetic and existentialist beauty to being philosophical. I respect that part of myself. I prize it. It's the one thing about myself that I wish everyone had. While it may not be unconditionally good (that depends on a few definitions, Kant), it's one of the few pure things I pursue. It's something I can hold onto during the storms of life. It's a part of who I am, and I hope to continue to weave it deeper and more completely inside the fabric of my being.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> One of my professors, Bruce Brower, had the (false) humility to claim he wasn't a philosopher. He reserved the term for the gods, Aristotle, etc. I prefer to think of these gods as simply being better philosophers. I'm sure plenty of people would find this post disturbing, perhaps even arrogantly delusional. But, this is my reflection, not theirs.</sub></p></div>
