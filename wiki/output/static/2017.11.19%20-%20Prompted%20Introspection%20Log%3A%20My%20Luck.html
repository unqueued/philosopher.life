<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Are you ever lucky? Tell about it.</h2><p>What is luck? It's a fortuitous chance event, something outside of one's control, and there's generally no substitute for it.</p><p>I have tons of moral luck. When from the veil of ignorance you attempt to objectively evaluate a person who lives in my shoes, including all my morally arbitrary characteristics, you will find I have been incredibly lucky to have been born into the life I have.</p><p>Economically I was born in the top 1% of the world, and even accounting for huge differences in costs of living, I'm still incredibly lucky to have not only the basic means of survival but a wide range of convenience luxuries and experiences that are not easy to come by. </p><p>I was born to parents who valued education (I would partially deny that after careful discourse, but you know I'm an extreme elitist on the subject). We are educated beyond our income bracket and background by miles. Only about 5% of the world can even claim to have a degree of education similar to ours. When you look closely, you will realize not all schools and disciplines are equal. I'm lucky to have an education available only to a vanishingly small number of humans. I'd hedged-conservatively wager that at best 0.005% of the world population has an education actually similar in rigor to mine. </p><p>We've reached a point where I have to be even more incredibly arrogant sounding: I think I'm a genius. While I may not be perfectly mentally stable and definitely have my fair share of emotional and intellectual burdens+failures, it is clear that I hit the genetic lottery in addition to the blessings of my other circumstances. I know how fucking ludicrous that sounds; you probably want to put me in my place, don't you, Samwise? I am deeply flawed, but I'm also a beautiful freak. The jokes about Millenial snowflakes make me laugh; I really do think I'm special, almost entirely due to luck.</p><p>I have the luck of leisure and laziness that few homo sapiens, even my contemporaries, have ever had. In terms of my era of birth, I've been fairly lucky. I live right at the edge of the cliff of human existence. I've been able to taste the climax of humanity before it falls into self-induced extinction.</p><p>I am exceptionally lucky to be alive at beginning of the internet, to have had a computer since I was born, to have been able to push for access to information, digital experiences, and networks from the beginning. That wild west was gorgeous. I have unprecedented access even among digital natives, and this is due to a series of lucky opportunities seized. My experience machines are enriched.</p><p>I'm extremely lucky to have found my wife. Do you know how hard it is to find humans who both can and will empathize with me? 1 in a million is perhaps an understatement. I could not have handpicked two better to children to have either. They've taught me what to even look for. </p><p>I've had a ton of undeserved second chances and unmerited first chances. All lives are unique, but some are far luckier than others. I have been quite lucky.</p><p>My brother likes to joke I'm always lucky in video games. So, there's that too. =)</p></div>
