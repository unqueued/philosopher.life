<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am sorry.  When I look back at what has transpired between us over the years all I see is where you have been watching out for me.  I contrariwise have been of little value for you it seems.  I am sorry that I have been so selfish.  Please forgive me.  I have asked you in the past why we are friends over and over again because I wonder why you put up with me and cared about me when I didn't reciprocate.  I feel that I am somehow walking about in a fog and when something gets out of my field of view my blinders quickly let me think no longer of what was there just moments before.  I do not know if this is some biological, chemical, or behavioral aspect of my nature or if I am just a lazy, self-centered animal chasing after a thrown ball.  I do have some moments of clarity, like now, where this nature of mine is at the forefront of my conscience but I am all too willing to sweep it under the rug and to go back to wallow in my mud puddle.  I wish that I acted differently.  Reading your blog, as I have over the past month or so has made me realize that I have no idea how deep the rabbit hole in your mind goes and frankly lots of what is presented doesn't stick when I read it.  I see the words and the letters but am unable to assign any real concrete meaning to many topics that you address over and over again.  I thought you were pretty much alone before and now, more than ever, I see some inkling as to how truly alone you must be.  Honestly, I am at a loss as to how to approach you.  Even now I am sending text streams that you may or may not get in a timely manner because frankly I am afraid of what reply you would make in real time.  I am afraid of the interaction with and what introspection you might bring to bear on me.  That unknown is scary.  Very scary to me.  Damn these emotions, how they cripple me so sometimes.  I am not eager to hear your reply to this but I am eager in a way as well.  I both want and not want to hear it.  Is that odd?  Am I a fool?  Sometimes I think I am.  More to the point, I am not for sure how to proceed in this message.  Yet, I feel that there is more to say on the matter.  I once felt that I was able to approach you and to talk on a deeper level with you.  I do not have that feeling now.  I am saddened by the changes that I see in you.  When my family and I stopped by your place to visit I felt that you were extending simple courtesies that I would have thought your former self would have considered superficial.  My wife is thoroughly flabbergasted with you.  She so much wants to try to win you back to the tradition you were raised in.  Knowing your skill with reason better men than I would fail in that venture if attempted I would suppose and lest I make you suffer from my feeble attempts in that arena I assure myself that I would only make an ass of myself If I were to try.  Am I silly that I went through that last sentence trying to figure out where I would put punctuation as to try to get it to flow as it did in my stream of consciousness?  Another idea also comes to mind, now that I think back on our time together, this must come across to you as my writing has in the past as me trying to use words to make myself feel smarter than I am.  In actuality, the words are trying to mask the apprehension that I feel inside because I have seen my closest friend, after I have wronged him and cut off contact with him, have such a change come about in his life that makes me shudder at the thought.  Like Gandhi in the original civilizations game, you have had your numbers roll over from the hard-coded maximum of 255 to 1 and now seemingly want to see all the nations leveled in atomic fire.  Excuse my analogy, it is a poor one.  It is as though you have done a 180 from the person I used to think I knew.  Honestly, this change frightens me.  I do not know how to broach this with you and that I why I am writing what I am now with the dual purpose to say that I am sorry for having failed you and that somewhere in me I still care for you and want to see your good.  Make of this what you will as you have always been better at reading other people and I have never really ever been that good at reading myself for what I am afraid I might see.  Or I could just be a monkey thrashing away at a keyboard trying to compose Shakespeare.  I do not know how to end this message now that I have said what seems to have come to mind now so I will just end it with the following full stop.    
</p></blockquote><p>You may be one of the only people who read my blog.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.03</sup></button> You may not understand me, but you actually try to empathize with me. I consider that a true sign of friendship. It means a lot to me. You are correct: I feel very lonely. That you read my blog and respond to me makes me feel listened to, thank you. </p><p>You shouldn't feel my transformation is your fault. It isn't. My loss of faith in God and Humanity has been a long time coming. The logical implications are still rippling through me, and my existential wrestling is not over yet. This hasn't been overnight either; it really has been a long time coming. I still have bits and pieces of my writing from college. It was there too, and even before then. It's been a journey, and it's not your fault. </p><p>I have definitely changed. I hope this time I will find happiness. </p><p>If you are interested, join me in having a conversation with yourself. Head to <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://tiddlywiki.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://tiddlywiki.com</a> and grab a blank one. Use Firefox and the Tiddlyfox add-on. I'd be glad to read yours as well. I'm happy to host it for you if you want. What domain would you want? The .life TLDs are cheap and interesting.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2018.12.03 : </span> It turned out this meant he wasn't going to pay attention or try to understand what I've been saying. This was a lame attempt to justify his conveniently selfish ignorance in the end. He's a psychopath.</sub></p></div>
