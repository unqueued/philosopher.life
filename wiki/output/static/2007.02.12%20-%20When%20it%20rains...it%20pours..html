<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Our family had a rough week.</p><p>1.) Bathrooms are still acting up. Plumbers have come 4 times (none of us happy about it, they'll get a mouthful if we have to call them again), they told us to use Charmin...dad says to use Scott. I'll trust dad. It is only periodically problematic, and not as big of issue as nothing is going into our bathtub (eww).</p><p>2.) k0sh3k had a migraine that lasted for 4 of 5 days (1 day intercession). She was in agony (I felt awful for her). She laid in bed...The baby and I kept quiet, far away from her. She won't let me do anything for her. I can only give her the medicine our doctor gave us (doesn't work though). Beyond medicine, all I can do to help is cover her eyes and keep light out of the room as best as possible. The constant drone-like headache she experiences day in and day out on top of these ever-increasing migraines has me worried. I have no idea what to do‚ÄìI pray often (not that I expect any results). We are going to the doctor again this Wednesday. I have my personal thoughts concerning the possible causes, or rather the uprising and higher frequency of these headaches, but I'm not a doctor, so I'll keep them to myself for now.</p><p>3.) I somehow managed to hit the curb (again, *sigh) with my vehicle. This time I dented the wheel. I thought, as the Kia is so light that I may have actually damage the body/frame/axel (doesn't take much to ruin a Kia). We were without a vehicle, and k0sh3k was incapacitated. Claudia and Joe? generously gave us a beat-up old Lincoln to use. That thing is a boat on wheels, a monster if I ever saw one. It worked for a few days. On k0sh3k's one-day without a migraine, we managed to get the Kia to Charlie's with a note (after having called them as well), and drove back to the house in the boat (happy sailing). Then, the battery died in the boat. I charged it up several times, but that battery is dead, dead beyond dead. I missed 3 days of work. I ended up caving in, I rented for 48 hours, cost me 170 dollars. I grabbed a ride home from Janet. That day (Friday), Charlie called and said that the store sent him the wrong part and that it would be another week before we could get our vehicle back. The next day I worked to see what I could do for another vehicle. Luckily, Claudia and Joe came to replace the battery√Ç  that day (they were unable to come all week...).</p><p>4.) Amidst this whirlwind, while I was going to fill up the gas tank, I somehow managed to rip a deep gash into my thumb. We went to the hospital because it looked like it needed stitches (and it probably did). But, the line was too long, and I had coagulated quite effectively, so we just went home. We cleaned it ritually, and bandaged it often.</p><p>Oh yeah, JRE was over last weekend too. But, that isn't a bad thing.</p><p>Anyways, it is Monday morning of the next week, I'm at work, and I'm glad last week is over. The boat works, the Kia is getting fixed, my thumb is doing much better, k0sh3k has yet another doctor's appointment on Wednesday, we're giving a speech about how Mom'n'Dad are doing in Thailand to the prison -church, and unfortunately k0sh3k is feeling another migraine coming on. God bless her. Lucky for us, finances aren't a problem, we have health and auto insurance, we have people that look out for us, we have tons of food stocked, and we have a warm house to live in...plus, we found out that j3d1h adores kidney beans (I'll buy her anything she wants...! don't tell her that though).</p></div>
