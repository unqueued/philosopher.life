<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My brother talked to me while driving back from Lexington. It was boring for him, but not too awful (had to shop from the sounds of it...I know there are so many other important things for him to do). It's still an incredible whirlwind for him. I hope to be a good listener, especially since Raylan will be partially starting the move Nov 7 and fully moved on the 22nd (assuming everything goes according to plan). He is considering doing the baby-only route. This may be what works. I cannot know, and it doesn't matter what I think. I am also not convinced that they will find a permanent solution this way (which also seems totally fine), but who knows? There is much to think about. I aim to be a sounding board and offer computation I can offer him. </p><p>We talked about Emily and T-Money. I am clearly going to need to think more carefully. I am glad to hear him thinking on my behalf. I need help seeing who people are.</p><p>We talked about Sphygmus. It was cool to be able to explain what her gift meant, and he agreed that I should trust her. He seemed happy that his autistic brother made a friend. He contrasted this to his workplace where he continues to feel like he tends to make more enemies than friends (they call him booksmart, and as he walks through their arguments, they don't have a reason to have a problem...except that they are responsible for making sure their work is up to legal code...which is also his job a journeyman to point out [they all get held responsible!]). Among his generation (of journeyman), he's one of the few to have passed the masters exam in his union. He knows a lot more about the code than others, and that may be of great use to him if he transitions into teaching (or contract work, imho). The good ol' boys club thing will pose lots of trouble.</p><p>I told him I failed pretty miserably with the kids this week, despite my best efforts (I am relieved to hear my wife agree). I am always blown away by his reasoning about Raylan (he handles the nightmare so well). I wish I could capture his magic in a bottle. I'm also in love with the way Rebecca tries so fucking hard. Everyone loves to talk shit about the tryhards, but I'm legit impressed by both of them: they really mean it, and its not some mere GBP signal.</p><p>He let me wander in the conversation a lot today. I am grateful that he let me have my moments of silence too. </p><p>We talked about the meds. I remarked on how constructive they have enabled him to be. He doesn't feel happy, but he feels hope that he can do something to make himself happy. That dude might be fucking hero. He climbs Mount Habit. Proud might just be some patronizing word. I feel like a cheering fan in the stands 300 miles away.</p><p>He told me about his perfectionism with the woodworked dinosaur. The curves made it tricky, and from his image I can easily believe it. I told him that it reminded me of those classic woodworked childrens toys (because it definitely has that very artisan feel to it) crossed over with those technically manufactured balsa kits for constructing dinosaur skeletons. I think I failed to explain my compliment well enough. I really liked what he made, and I'm glad he just &quot;jumped into it.&quot; </p><p>His voice sounded far more normalized. I think his throat is getting better (though it may start scabbing bad soon). </p><p>I know there is pain, but I am feeling hopeful for him.</p><p>We have talked a lot this weekend. Fuck yeah!</p></div>
