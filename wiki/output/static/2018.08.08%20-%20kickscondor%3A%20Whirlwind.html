<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Dear kickscondor,</p><p>You'll have to forgive my inability to communicate quickly.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">e</sup></button> Life has been a whirlwind for me (my wiki is evidence before the moral courtroom). I fully intend to respond to you though, even if it takes me a bit.</p><blockquote><p>It is a real surprise to get a note from you. Frankly, I‚Äôm blown away by what you‚Äôre doing‚Äîand I felt that you were deeply embedded somewhere in your wiki, not exactly reaching out to pass notes. But I‚Äôm so glad.</p></blockquote><p>Thank you. It's my pleasure to reach out to you. I've been following your work since my last letter. I've been watching you some on HN as well. I am increasingly excited by the work you are doing. My wife is a librarian, and it feels like you are doing indieweb-librarian work to me. Do you consider it part of your vocation?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">p</sup></button> It feels like more than just an aesthetic experience to me.</p><blockquote><p>The representation you‚Äôve chosen for yourself is no illusion. If all I see of someone is pictures and quips, the image of that person is just a bit of shattered glass. But one thousand words cannot lie. They may be untrue, but they divulge so many more triangles to build that person with.</p></blockquote><p>This is a fascinating way to say it. If I understand correctly, there are diminishing returns in the scaling of triangles for visual modeling. I can only assume I hit similar kinds of walls and problems.</p><blockquote><p>I am reluctant to say that even a verbose persona can ever be accurate, though. We start to believe that these pixels are us. I think they are just a good show. We are always in public here. And our souls know it.</p></blockquote><p>Please take no offense, but I vehemently <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> you are wrong. I hope to do something like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.08.08%2520-%2520PPP%253A%2520Montaigne.html">Montaigne</a>. I realize the isomorphism is inevitably a failure (e.g. {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}, {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Help.html">Help</a>}, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hlexicon.html">hlexicon</a>), but I hope that my representation becomes increasingly accurate and useful to me. Even if I fail, I hope to come closer and closer to success on this issue. I will think more about your reluctance, since you clearly see from an angle I do not.</p><p>This may sound a bit crazy to you (you already know I'm half mad ;P), but I hope to use my snapshot corpus to train ML tools to speak like me (with me). That may just be a {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Dreams.html">Dream</a>}, and it may be philosophically impossible if not technically infeasible. </p><blockquote><p>I do look forward to the good show you have going. (Likewise: to you out there reading‚Äîhark, reader!‚Äîwe are looking for you. Please read h0p3‚Äôs Find the Others as proof.)</p></blockquote><p>I have completely revamped <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">Find The Others</a> in light of your remark. Thank you for making me think more about it and holding me accountable. I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> it conveys my intentions more effectively. I feel a lot less alone seeing you engage in this activity as well, albeit you do so more effectively in several respects. When I get the chance, I hope to reach out to the majority of the people/sites you have been cataloging.</p><blockquote><p>I like what you are doing; my quest differs. I‚Äôm not looking for an ennobled species of thinker. I don‚Äôt want to avoid the unsavories. I am looking for Anyone. This is not right‚Äîthere are plenty of Anyone‚Äôs around, aren‚Äôt there? Well, I am wanting to fall into fate, rather than to find only my most meaningful bosom friend. I want to travel down the river and stop at all the places that happen to be there along the way. And maybe a friend will crop up. Strange things, images and tales, too.</p></blockquote><p>You appear to be a cartographer and connoisseur of the last remnants of the digital wild west. I'm going to bet that you and I grew up interacting with many dark corners of the interwebs which have faded over time. I believe you are an explorer, diving into the cracks. I think very highly of the work you are doing. I respect your quest. </p><p>I hope you don't think I'm a snob. I would argue I deal with many unsavories. I do try to communicate with The Other using <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> reasoning. You have an openness which I hope to emulate, of course.</p><blockquote><p>Yes, well, this is quite stunning actually. There is a sense on your wiki of a full use of hypertext that I haven‚Äôt seen before. It is the complexity of your organization and nomenclature. It is somehow still inviting. You have made a journal that is a vast puzzle.</p></blockquote><p>I'm glad that you see it! I cannot tell you how many people do not. I'm trying not to worry about it too much (that might sound odd). Since you have listened, I am listening closely to your advice, nomad. If there is a way to improve my practice, do not hold back. </p><blockquote><p>I have been working, privately, on a directory of the web from a certain vantage. (I don‚Äôt know that my role is to journal; more, to explore out there.) And I think the real key that has been missing‚Äîfrom directories, wikis and engines‚Äîis artistry. To make it beautiful and elegant. Your work is a brilliant stone in that respect. Anyway, (hark, reader,) I‚Äôll stop there.</p></blockquote><p>I will be interested to see what you do with your collection and method. You reach out effectively, and you have a message. I have seen it several times now. I hope you will be a beacon. </p><p>Do you tell your students your vision? How about your children? </p><blockquote><p>Well, this will be fruitful. Feel no pressure to find some technology to make a connection with me. Climb down. We can link just fine.</p></blockquote><p>You are obviously technically distinguished, and I've been thinking about a problem which you've probably seen a dozen answers to. I have now been asked twice for a way to push notifications of updates (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="h0p3's%2520Wiki%2520Updates%2520%2526%2520Notifications.html">h0p3's Wiki Updates &amp; Notifications</a>). I am worried that my wiki isn't well-designed for that. I'm not entirely sure what I would push to others (my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a> kind of does that). I would like to know your thoughts on where I should go with this.</p><p>On a completely different notes:</p><ul><li>I originally started on h0p3.xyz as my gTLD. I ran into a couple problems using it. I think it may have some spam reputation. Are you pleased with .xyz?</li><li>Let me also say, you are careful with your identity. I admire it. Please tell me about the origins of your name. I want to understand the story.</li></ul><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">e : </span> For the record, I do not hold these expectations of you. I just don't like the fact that I take so long to respond.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">p : </span> I have asked you some very personal questions, and I will continue to do so, nomad.</sub></p></div>
