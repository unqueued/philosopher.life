<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>We had a session on Aristotle‚Äôs God. This puts us in a decent position to understand Aquinas‚Äô arguments and where he is coming from. Perhaps Aquinas sheds some of the characteristics of Aristotle‚Äôs God, but retains much of Aristotle‚Äôs systematic view of ontology, teleology, and arguments for the existence of God.</p><p>Aquinas</p><p>Aquinas offers us objections, an argument (in this case 5), and responses to the original objections in virtue of his argument. As usual, he gives us a short, but action-packed prose-style.</p><p>Objection 1:</p><p>God‚Äôs infinite Good and the evil in the world.</p><p>If God existed, then there would be infinite good.</p><p>If there was infinite good, then there couldn‚Äôt be any evil in the world.</p><p>There is evil in the world, therefore God doesn‚Äôt exist.</p><p>Objection 2:</p><p>Something like Occam‚Äôs razor</p><p>The fewest number of principles is the best explanation for something else.</p><p>One of the simplest explanations for the physical world are natural principles and causes.</p><p>God‚Äôs existence isn‚Äôt necessary to explain the natural world, thus we don‚Äôt need to posit that God exists</p><p>5 Ways to Prove that God exists.</p><p>I‚Äôm not what Aquinas means ‚ÄúProve‚Äù here. Normally, I take the word ‚ÄúProve‚Äù to be a very strong word. When I think of proofs, I think of deductive proofs in logic or mathematics. In philosophy, outside of logic, we usually shouldn‚Äôt claim we have proof. It is better to more conservatively claim that we have strong evidence, or good reasons, or a worthy argument for a claim rather than proof.</p><p>1st Way (and clearest) ‚Äì Motion, the Unmoved Mover argument:</p><p>This is very much like the Aristotelian argument we looked at:</p><p>Some things in this world are moved.</p><p>Everything that is moved is moved by another.</p><p>Everything that moves is in a state of potentiality, moving toward the state of actuality.</p><p>Only an object in some relevant state of actuality can affect the motion of something else .</p><p>Example: Consider a fire in a relevant state of actuality, and consider a piece of wood which has the potential to be hot. The fire moves and alters the piece of wood, making it hot.</p><p>It is impossible for something to be simultaneously in potentiality and in actuality with respect to the same thing</p><p>What is hot in actuality can‚Äôt be hot in potentiality as well.</p><p>A change in degrees of temperature requires potentiality.</p><p>There isn‚Äôt a potential to have the same temperature; that‚Äôs just what maintaining actuality is.</p><p>Therefore, Aquinas says, ‚Äúit is impossible that something should be both mover and moved in the same way and with respect to the same thing, or, in other words, that something should move itself.‚Äù</p><p>There is not an infinite chain of movers.</p><p>If there were an infinite chain, then there couldn‚Äôt be a first mover.</p><p>If there is no first mover, then there can‚Äôt be any movers.</p><p>Thus, there must be a first mover, an unmoved mover, and that is what everyone should take to be God.</p><p>Objections:</p><p>Why should we agree that nothing can move itself?</p><p>Why deny the infinite regress?</p><p>More specifically, why should we agree that if there isn‚Äôt a first mover, then there can‚Äôt be any movers.</p><p>If God is pure actuality, then it seems difficult to see how God moved anything.</p><p>The only recourse is this ‚Äúby inspiring desire‚Äù kind of movement that Aristotle gives us. But, is this really a kind of movement?</p><p>2nd Way (efficient cause):</p><p>Aquinas is taking a page straight out of Aristotle, again. Aristotle categorized ‚Äúcauses or aspects of change‚Äù into four fundamental types. All physical artifacts and natural objects have at least one of each of these 4 causes to explain its causation. These 4 causes explain ‚Äúwhy‚Äù (and maybe ‚Äúhow‚Äù) something has been caused.</p><p>A material cause is the aspect of change which is determined by the material a thing is made of.</p><p>It is ‚Äúthat out of which‚Äù a thing is made.</p><p>For a table, that might be wood; for a statue it might be bronze.</p><p>The material cause is really about material composition.</p><p>A formal cause is a change caused by the arrangement, shape or appearance of a thing.</p><p>It is ‚Äúthe form‚Äù of a thing, or ‚Äúthe account of what-it-is-to-be‚Äù a thing.</p><p>For the table, it is having some kind of shape, generally with legs and top. This can vary somewhat, but it has to some a table-shape.</p><p>The ratio 2:1 is the formal cause or shape or arrangement of the octave in sound.</p><p>An efficient cause are the agents of change. These are things interacting with the changed thing.</p><p>It is ‚Äúthe primary source of the change‚Äù</p><p>For example, the efficient cause of a table is a carpenter</p><p>The efficient causes of a child are the biological reproducers</p><p>The efficient cause of the statue is the sculptor or artisan</p><p>A final cause is the aim or purpose being served by it.</p><p>It is ‚Äúthe end, that for the sake of which a thing is done‚Äù</p><p>Health is the end or final cause of dieting and exercise.</p><p>For a seed, it might be an adult plant.</p><p>The final cause of the kitchen table is to have a place to make and eat food, a place to sit around and talk, etc.</p><p>The final cause of the statue is beauty or to inspire happiness or contemplation or remembrance.</p><p>The following argument focuses on the efficient cause.</p><p>For Aristotle and Aquinas, the concept of motion involves dependency, relying upon the concepts of potentiality and actuality, and not necessarily temporal succession or creation. That‚Äôs probably the main difference between the unmoved argument and the efficient cause argument. The efficient cause is conceptually bound to a temporal, causal sequence, and perhaps it deals more in bringing a thing into being rather than simple change. So, it‚Äôs likely that Aquinas thinks the efficient cause and unmoved mover arguments are relevantly different.</p><p>Aquinas‚Äôs argument:</p><p>Argument form:</p><p>There is an efficient cause for every sensible thing; nothing can be the efficient cause of itself.</p><p>If something were the efficient cause of itself, then it would need to be prior to itself, which is impossible.</p><p>You need a carpenter, as an efficient cause, to build the table. The table, before it comes into being, can‚Äôt build itself as an efficient cause.</p><p>It is not possible to regress to infinity in efficient causes.</p><p>If there is no first cause then there will be no others.</p><p>Therefore, a First Cause exists (and this is God).</p><p>Objections:</p><p>Why should we agree that it isn‚Äôt possible to have an infinite regress of efficient causes?</p><p>Consider the initial objection, an argument from simplicity:</p><p>If the simplest explanation is the best one:</p><p>Perhaps an infinite regress of causes is a more simple explanation than the existence of God.</p><p>Why should we agree that time has a beginning as Aquinas‚Äô argument seems to assume?</p><p>Aquinas assumes a foundation, a beginning, to prevent this infinite regress. Maybe we shouldn‚Äôt accept that foundationalist move.</p><p>For example, maybe the universe is a circle of causes which have no foundation, but loop around in some coherent web of causes. This coherentist loop of causes might prevent the regress as well, and it doesn‚Äôt require a first-mover.</p><p>Why does the First cause have to be God? Even if we agree there is a first cause, do we need a further argument to show why this first cause is actually God?</p><p>Multiple First Causes</p><p>Even if we cede much of the argument to Aquinas, why should we agree there is only one first cause?</p><p>Maybe there are many first causes, many unmoved movers. Aquinas‚Äô argument seems conceptually open to this possibility, right?</p><p>If there was only one first cause, we would be more tempted to agree that first cause is God. But, for multiples, that temptation may wane.</p><p>Of course, this doesn‚Äôt seem to defeat Aquinas‚Äô argument - he could conceptually agree to multiple first causes and that God is one of them, but it does seem foist the burden of argument on him a bit further. Why should we think of one of those first causes as being so special that it is God?</p><p>Without Aquinas‚Äô understanding causality, this argument fails.</p><p>Accidental Correlation Problem</p><p>Just because Event B has always followed Event A, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Event A causes Event B ‚Äì the sequence may simple be accidental correlation rather than causation.</p><p>But, the skeptic worries this applies to all events. How then are we to truly distinguish between correlation and causation? How do we know, beyond a shadow of doubt, that causation obtains in the world? It could all just be correlation.</p><p>I think Aquinas might be able to come back as claim this radical kind of doubt has too high an epistemic standard.</p><p>Simultaneous Causation Problem</p><p>You might worry that as you scope in on an instance of causation, you won‚Äôt really find causation, but rather two events happening independently and simultaneously.</p><p>Any appearance of causation simply means you‚Äôve not closely examined it enough. You have to magnify your scope in time and space.</p><p>Perhaps this is also a radical kind of skepticism.</p><p>Other Scientific Models of Causation</p><p>Perhaps Aquinas‚Äôs theory of causation might be too simple, simplifying natural causality just in terms of a temporal sequence of causes.</p><p>There might be better theories of causation which simply don‚Äôt allow for this kind of argument to work.</p><p>We might worry there is a contradiction in the argument, where it seems to difficult to see why the first premise is logically consistent with the existence of God.</p><p>The first premise states, &quot;There is an efficient cause for everything, nothing can be the efficient cause of itself.&quot;</p><p>Is, then, God something or nothing?</p><p>If God is something, then we can ask, &quot;What caused God?&quot;</p><p>By assumption, nothing causes itself, therefore something would have to have caused God. But, few would be willing to accept that God could be caused by anything or at least anything else.</p><p>If you deny God was caused, then you‚Äôd have to say God is nothing.</p><p>If God is nothing, then God's existence is not proven or perhaps even provable.</p><p>If God is claimed to have a privileged status, an exception to this first premise, then maybe the argument becomes viciously circular or maybe there is a kind of question begging which occurs in the first premise.</p><p>Third Way (Possible and Necessary):</p><p>The Argument from Necessity:</p><p>Since some objects in the universe come into being and pass away, it is possible either for those objects to exist or for those objects not to exist at any given time.</p><p>i.e. The existence of some objects are contingent and aren‚Äôt necessary</p><p>All contingent objects at some point in time didn‚Äôt exist.</p><p>Assume for the sake of argument that: every object which exists is contingent.</p><p>Then at some point nothing existed in the world.</p><p>But, ‚ÄúWhat does not exist begins to exist only through something that does exist‚Äù</p><p>i.e. No thing is created from absolutely nothing (not to be confused with creation ex nihilo, which actually posits that something exists, namely God, before everything else was created)</p><p>Thus, given our assumption, nothing would exist now.</p><p>But, Objects do exist now.</p><p>Thus, our assumption is absurd. Therefore, the opposite must be true.</p><p>Not everything which exists is contingent.</p><p>i.e. Something is necessary, and moreover, we can trace the existence of contingent objects eventually to some necessary object (or objects).</p><p>Every necessary object is either caused to be necessary by something else or not.</p><p>An infinite regress of necessary objects causing the necessity of other necessary objects is impossible.</p><p>Therefore, some necessary object is not caused by anything to be necessary. This object or being is ‚Äúnecessary per se.‚Äù This necessary per se being is God, and He causes all other necessary objects to be necessary.</p><p>Objections:</p><p>Attacking the regress:</p><p>Why should we think non-God necessary objects are caused to be necessary?</p><p>If we deny this, it isn‚Äôt clear that Aquinas really gets to diffuse a regress with God as the foundation.</p><p>Why should we think contingent objects didn‚Äôt exist at some point in time?</p><p>Maybe there are some contingent objects which have always existed, and maybe exist eternally, but aren‚Äôt necessary objects.</p><p>There might be possible worlds in which those contingent objects don‚Äôt exist.</p><p>Remember the distinction between possible and contingent.</p><p>Why should we agree that something contingent cannot come into existence except through something that does exist?</p><p>i.e. why should we agree that no thing is created from absolutely nothing</p><p>Some people might have a problem with presenting objects themselves as being necessary or contingent. Some people might consider necessity and contingency to belong to the realm of ideas alone.</p><p>If you think it‚Äôs unacceptable to apply logical notions to objects, then Aquinas‚Äô argument may or may not work.</p><p>Others, like Plantinga, are more than willing to extend these logical notions to states of affairs, and perhaps even to objects.</p><p>Perhaps we could re-interpret the argument simply in terms of propositions, but I‚Äôm not sure if it would still work.</p><p>4th way (gradations or degrees of existence in the world):</p><p>FRIENDLY REMINDER ABOUT FINAL PAPER ‚Äì Due about 6 weeks from now</p><p>There are different degrees of goodness, nobility, and ‚Äúbeing‚Äù in things.</p><p>Again, think of the scholastic assumption (which is also an assumption that Plato and perhaps Aristotle make) that there are degrees of existence or realness tied to goodness of the object. To Aquinas, a holy being is ethereal, not concrete, and has a higher, greater, and more real existence than tangible and more evil beings.</p><p>‚Äúmore‚Äù or ‚Äúless‚Äù can only be predicated of things in relation to something which is maximally predicated in the same respect</p><p>E.g. ‚Äúthe hotter something is, the closer it approaches that which is maximally hot‚Äù</p><p>i.e. For there to be degrees of being at all, there must be something which has ‚Äúbeing‚Äù in the highest degree.</p><p>According to Aquinas‚Äô take on Aristotle: something which is ‚Äúmaximally true‚Äù is a ‚Äúmaximal being‚Äù</p><p>But, ‚Äúthat which is maximal in a given genus is a cause of all the things that belong to that genus‚Äù</p><p>E.g. fire, which is maximally hot, is a cause of all hot things</p><p>Thus, since truth, goodness, and nobility are predicates, something is maximally true, good, and noble.</p><p>Therefore, something is a ‚Äúcause for the being of all beings, their goodness, and their perfections.‚Äù</p><p>This something, this cause, is God.</p><p>God is this Being in the Highest Degree, this Perfect Being for which all other things on gradiant of his attributes rely upon for their existence.</p><p>Objections:</p><p>Does this argument not also show that there is also something which is maximally evil? Should we have a problem with that?</p><p>Maybe this is related to the first objection Aquinas is dealing with: the problem of evil.</p><p>Why should we agree there are degrees of existence?</p><p>Is existence something which is more like a binary switch: it either exists or it doesn‚Äôt, with nothing in between?</p><p>Why should we agree that for something to be somewhat hot, that there must exist something which is maximally hot? And if we can deny this, can we not deny the same for all supposedly graded predicates, including goodness, nobility, and existence?</p><p>Why should we assume, as Aquinas seems to, that ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù is a quality of objects?</p><p>Without this assumption, the scholastic belief about the relationship between goodness and existence doesn‚Äôt do any work for explaining the existence of God</p><p>Similarly, if there is a conflation between goodness and existence, one might worry that existence is taken to be a first-order predicate here. If you deny existence to be a first-order predicate of objects, then this might be a problem.</p><p>5th way (Governance ‚Äì The Final Cause argument - The Teleological argument):</p><p>Some things which lack cognition ‚Äúact for the sake of an end.‚Äù (And probably all things on Aquinas‚Äô view)</p><p>They have a telos, a purpose, a function, a ‚Äúfor the sake of which‚Äù they exist and act</p><p>Further, they are ordered and arranged toward those ends.</p><p>These things without cognition have their telos not by chance, but by design and on purpose.</p><p>Things without cognition ‚Äútend toward an end only if they are directed by something that has cognition and intelligence‚Äù similar to how ‚Äúan arrow is directed by an archer.‚Äù</p><p>Therefore, something with cognition and intelligence has ordered these natural things which lack cognition, and that something is God.</p><p>Objections:</p><p>Why should we agree everything has a telos?</p><p>Even if everything has a telos, why should we agree everything has been designed, ordered, or arranged?</p><p>How do we know what a design, ordering, or arrangement would be like?</p><p>Even if something is ordered, why couldn‚Äôt it simply be naturally ordered or self-organized?</p><p>Problem of evil:</p><p>Why should we think a God would design the world to have evil in it?</p><p>But, this was one of the original objections Aquinas wants to answer.</p><p>Why should we think that the God is the great designer?</p><p>Couldn‚Äôt there be many designers? This argument doesn‚Äôt seem to rule out polytheism</p><p>Reply to Objection 1 (problem of evil):</p><p>‚Äúit is part of God‚Äôs infinite goodness that He should permit evils and elicit goods from them‚Äù</p><p>Permit isn‚Äôt the same as design, is it?</p><p>Reply to Objection 2 (Occam‚Äôs razor suggests God doesn‚Äôt exist; there is a simpler explanation for existence):</p><p>There must be a higher agent that designs or directs nature to some end, and God is that director, designer, and first cause.</p><p>Clarke</p><p>Some immutable and independent being has always existed.</p><p>All other things are dependent on this immutable, independent being for their existence, else there is an infinite regress.</p><p>Nothing new.</p><p>PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION EVENT</p><p>Philosophy club at Tulane will be hosting a panel discussion on the existence of god and the nature of religious knowledge at the.

That knowledge is obtained via experience and sensation.</p><p>I learned the rules and mechanics of a video game by reading about it, by being in the world, by experiencing and sensing the video game and literature surrounding it.</p><p>Traditionally, experience is concerned with sensations. Maybe this is an oversimplification though.</p><p>a priori</p><p>a belief, knowledge, argument, or justification obtained (or obtainable) independently of experience</p><p>e.g.</p><p>Perhaps 2+2=4 is something you could know even if you had no sensations whatsoever.</p><p>The truth that a bachelor is an unmarried male.</p><p>I am think, therefore I am.</p><p>A priori knowledge is traditionally considered the pinnacle of belief-types. It often is associated with absolute certainty and necessity.</p><p>Many questions about how these work, the nature of them, etc.</p><p>Ontological argument is a priori.</p><p>It deals solely in concepts and thinking. You need not sense or experience the world, perhaps, to understand the argument.</p><p>Conversely, the Cosmological argument is claimed to be a posteriori.</p><p>It assumes the existence of the universe.</p><p>I‚Äôm actually not immediately sold on this. On a developed solipsistic view (Descartes expanded into phenomenology), it isn‚Äôt clear to me that the cosmological argument absolutely has to be a posteriori.</p><p>Rowe briefly traces the history of the Cosmological argument.</p><p>He claims the first three arguments in Aquinas‚Äô 5 ways are versions of the Cosmological argument, and he summarizes them.</p><p>Later, Rowe considers the influence of Leibniz, Clarke, and Hume on this debate.</p><p>This 18th century arena is where Rowe will concentrate his argument</p><p>Rowe considers the real structure of the Cosmological argument</p><p>Rowe says: ‚ÄúNow it might be objected that even if Aquinas‚Äô arguments do prove beyond doubt the existence of an unchanging changer, an uncaused cause, and a being that could not have failed to exist, the arguments fail to prove the existence of the theistic God.‚Äù</p><p>This objection demonstrates that the Cosmological Argument really has two parts (even if it isn‚Äôt articulated or defended that way by Aquinas)</p><p>Rowe Claims the first stage is ‚Äúthe effort to prove the existence of a special sort of being.‚Äù</p><p>Rowe wields Aquinas‚Äô word here like the double-edged sword it is. As I said before, and as I think Rowe should be claiming in charity, we shouldn‚Äôt be charging the theist with the effort or need to prove God exists. A justified argument is good enough!</p><p>Second stage is to demonstrate that this special sort of being which exists is actually God, with the sorts of attributes traditionally ascribed</p><p>The arguments we read from Aquinas are only the first stage, but later in work we didn‚Äôt read, he tries to develop this second stage.</p><p>Rowe wants to concentrate on the 1st stage of the 18th century form of this argument</p><p>Rowe gives us some technical terms</p><p>Dependent Being</p><p>A being whose existence is accounted for by the causal activity of others</p><p>A Self-existent Being</p><p>A being whose existence is accounted for by its own nature</p><p>At this stage, I think it might be natural to wonder why we aren‚Äôt using ‚ÄúIndependent Being‚Äù here</p><p>The 18th century form of the Cosmological argument seeks to establish the existence of a self-existence being.</p><p>With the terms, Rowe states the broad-strokes version of first stage of the Cosmological Argument:</p><p>The argument form:</p><p>Every being (that exists or ever did exist) is either a dependent being or a self-existent being.</p><p>Not every being can be a dependent being.</p><p>Therefore, there exists a self-existent being.</p><p>A brief primer in deductive validity</p><p>Validity is concerned with the structure of arguments. Primarily:</p><p>A valid argument is structured such that:</p><p>If the premises are the true, then the conclusion must be true.</p><p>The conclusion follows from the premises as a matter of logical consequence</p><p>Validity isn‚Äôt concerned with the truth values of the premises and conclusion, except with respect to that structure</p><p>E.g. A valid argument</p><p>Babe Ruth is the President of the United States</p><p>The President of the United States is from Indiana</p><p>Therefore, Babe Ruth is from Indiana</p><p>This example argument is valid.</p><p>In any possible world in which the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.</p><p>There is no possible world in which the premises are true and the conclusion false.</p><p>The actual world, this world, is such that the premises and conclusion are all false. In such a case, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the conclusion is true or false.</p><p>Even if the premises are false in the actual world, the argument itself is still valid.</p><p>E.g. Invalid argument</p><p>Babe Ruth is not the President of the United States</p><p>The President of the United States is not from Indiana</p><p>Therefore, Babe Ruth is from Indiana</p><p>The premises are true, but must the conclusion be true? Does it deductively follow from the premises?</p><p>No! There is a possible world in which the premises are true, and the conclusion false. Our world is an example counterexample to the validity of this argument.</p><p>The conclusion is false in this world.</p><p>Even if we change the conclusion to be true, adjusting Indiana to Maryland, the argument is still invalid!</p><p>Our world isn‚Äôt a counterexample world in such a case. But, we can conceive of a world in which the premises are true, and the conclusion false.</p><p>That we can conceive of such a world already demonstrates how it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, and thus how the structure of this argument is invalid.</p><p>There are no counterexamples to valid arguments. A valid argument is such that you cannot, by definition, conceive of a possible world in which the premises are true and the conclusion false. Validity is a very strong claim!</p><p>A sound argument is a valid argument in which the premises are true.

We can consider an example to understand why.</p><p>E.g. I am in this room.</p><p>The first part shows there must, at the very least, be an explanation for my existence.</p><p>But, note, not how, or why, or when, or where, or what I exist as. Many parts of this claim go beyond just my existing.</p><p>There are other ‚Äúpositive‚Äù facts besides my existence, and the first part doesn‚Äôt require an explanation of those other facts.</p><p>I‚Äôm overweight. I like philosophy. I like beer. I‚Äôm in this room rather than at home.</p><p>These attributes, predications, or facts aren‚Äôt required to have explanations on this first Anselmian part.</p><p>This second part of the PoSR requires an explanation of positive facts.</p><p>On the PoSR, there isn‚Äôt just a reason for my existence, but there must be a reason why I like beer.

We might not be able to make a convincing argument either way to demonstrate truth or falsity.</p><p>Rowe is trying to figure out if we can be rationally justified in accepting PSRa and PSRb.</p><p>Rowe is going after rational acceptability, a weaker notion and separate notion from truth.</p><p>Back to the Matrix example:</p><p>You all still want to say someone is rational when they believe they don‚Äôt live in the Matrix though, right?</p><p>The claim ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt in the Matrix‚Äù is rationally acceptable, even if don‚Äôt know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it is true.</p><p>Rowe is conceding the following:</p><p>If we are rationally justified in believing the PSR, and if the PSR validly supports the Cosmological premises, then we are rationally justified in asserting the Cosmological Conclusion.</p><p>The Second Premise</p><p>‚ÄúNot every being can be a dependent being.‚Äù</p><p>The proponent of this premise thinks there is something fundamentally wrong with an infinite regress of dependent beings caused or explained by other dependent beings.</p><p>‚ÄúA series‚Äù example</p><p>Assume for some specific time slice there only exists one being, A1, a living thing, and a dependent being.</p><p>Since it is dependent, something else had to bring it into existence</p><p>In a previous time slice, A1 was brought into existence by something else, A2, which perished shortly after it brought A1 into existence.</p><p>Hence, only A1 exists at this time slice</p><p>We can see that A2, similarly might need an explanation or cause, let‚Äôs say the same kind of story occurs, only with A3.</p><p>And for the same can be said for A3 from A4, and so on and so forth into the past.</p><p>Each of these beings in the A series is a dependent being.</p><p>It ‚Äúowes its existence‚Äù or is explained by the preceding A in the series</p><p>We have an infinite regress in this A series of dependent beings.</p><p>Rowe claims the Cosmologist must show there is ‚Äúsomething wrong with the idea‚Äù or ‚Äúview‚Äù of this infinite regress.</p><p>This is slightly ambiguous</p><p>If there is a difference between idea and view, I would say that an idea is a concept. To show there is something wrong with the concept of the infinite regress is a higher task than showing something is just wrong with a view possibly.</p><p>I‚Äôm not sure if Rowe is asking too much of his opponent here.</p><p>Rowe claims a ‚Äúpopular but mistaken idea of how the proponent tries to show that something is wrong with the view‚Äù goes as follow:</p><p>There must be a first being to start any causal series.</p><p>If every being were dependent there would be no first being to start the causal series.</p><p>Therefore, not every being can be a dependent being.</p><p>Valid argument, 2nd premise is true, but the 1st isn‚Äôt obviously true.</p><p>In fact, it seems to just be begging the question.</p><p>Note that the proponents in question are the 18th century Cosmologists</p><p>This is actually a part of one of the arguments Aquinas gave us. So, as far as generally how the Cosmological Argument goes, this is perhaps one of the ways in which proponents try to show what is wrong with the view,‚Äù but it may be a mistake to attribute this view to the 18th century Cosmologists</p><p>Rowe claims ‚Äúthere seems to be no good reason for making‚Äù the assumption that the infinite regress of dependent beings without a first does not or cannot obtain.</p><p>(note that you can have a first, then an infinite series afterward‚Ä¶but this isn‚Äôt a regress!)</p><p>That might be correct. Seem like there are ways to attack this though.</p><p>I worry there may be disagreement here which we can‚Äôt resolve on argumentation alone. For all I know, this may be one of those points in philosophy where it is okay to rely on your intuitions, and some people just have intuitions that deny the infinite regress, and so this rationally acceptable.</p><p>There are many, many definitions and ways to talk about rational acceptability. So many unclear things here.</p><p>18th century Cosmologists ‚Äúrecognized that the causal series of dependent beings could be infinite, without a first member to start the series‚Äù</p><p>18th Century Cosmologists ‚Äúrejected the idea that every being that is or ever was is dependent not because there would then be no first member,‚Äù but rather ‚Äúbecause there would then be no explanation for the fact that there are have always been dependent beings.‚Äù</p><p>Back to the A-series example.</p><p>‚Äúno individual A‚Äù in the series has an unexplained existence</p><p>No particular being is unexplained, apparently</p><p>Although, if the series itself isn‚Äôt explained, then it isn‚Äôt clear its components are explained either</p><p>Apparently, this satisfies PSRa, according to Rowe (although, maybe you‚Äôd want to deny that)</p><p>The 18th Century Cosmologist thinks the series itself lacks an explanation.</p><p>As Rowe likes to express it ‚ÄúThe fact that there are and have always been dependent beings‚Äù remains unexplained.</p><p>This seems to be a violation of PSRb, which Rowe believes the 18th Century Cosmologist agrees to and/or needs.</p><p>What happens when we seek a reason or explanation of the entire A series?</p><p>Rowe admits that we can‚Äôt explain the series by saying there is a series. That would be circular.</p><p>The supposition of an infinite regress of dependent beings causing dependent beings cannot be explained. There can‚Äôt be an explanation for it.</p><p>There is nothing outside the series, and only something outside the series could explain the series.</p><p>Questioning the justification of the second premise</p><p>There are critiques of this lack of explanation of the series as a whole.</p><p>1st, Treats the series of dependent beings as itself a dependent being.</p><p>E.g. The series of dependent beings is no more a dependent being than a collection of stamps is a stamp.</p><p>There is a trick to this one though. A lot of metaphysical problems sit at the root of this critique, and the Cosmologist has plenty of ammo to respond.</p><p>The analogy between beings and stamps is made too quickly. What exactly is a ‚Äúbeing‚Äù?</p><p>This critique seems to imply that we can reduce any collection of beings down to the constituent beings. That no being is the result of a collection or series of beings.</p><p>Why should we agree to that?</p><p>I‚Äôm a being, right?</p><p>Are the things which constituent me also beings? Probably!</p><p>The cells in me are beings, and all the cells are ordered in such a way that something greater seems to come out of it.</p><p>I‚Äôm also a being in time.</p><p>Part of who I am isn‚Äôt some time slice, but rather my identity passing through time. I‚Äôm a changing being, a person who moves, and that sequence or series of is still me.</p><p>All the cells in my body have been replaced several times, but I‚Äôm still the same being.</p><p>We can think of me as a series of being through time. The whole of which is greater than just the sum of its constituent parts through time.</p><p>But, if I don‚Äôt just reduce down, then perhaps the cosmologist has a really good point about how the series of dependent beings might itself be a being or at least something which itself needs an explanation.</p><p>I fear this critique uses a very narrow definition of ‚Äúbeing,‚Äù and that the PSR proponents still have plenty of rational, justifiable positions in metaphysics which support their view here.</p><p>2nd: Mistakenly infers that because each member of the collection of beings has a cause that the collection itself must have a cause.</p><p>E.g. Russell: As fallacious as inferring that because each member of the human race has a mother than the collection has a mother.</p><p>My worry with this is that if the Cosmologist can answer the first criticism by arguing the series is a kind of being (a complex one), then this objection no longer holds.</p><p>The reason this objection works, if it works, is because of the problem in the first criticism.</p><p>3rd: Hume: A failure to realize that ‚Äúfor there to be an explanation of a collection of things is nothing more than for there to be an explanation of each of members of that collection.‚Äù</p><p>I.e. Explanation for the whole is entirely reducible to explanations for the constituent parts</p><p>But, by definition, each member of the A-series has an explanation (the preceding, N+1, member). So, on this view, since all the members are explained, then the entire series is explained.</p><p>4th: Why can‚Äôt we just claim that the series itself has no explanation, as a ‚Äúbrute fact.‚Äù</p><p>Maybe this seems to be begging the question in the other direction if we take it as defeating the Cosmologist or PSR proponent.</p><p>I see no more reason to accept the brute fact of ‚Äúno explanation‚Äù for the series as I do for the brute fact of an explanation.</p><p>However, perhaps this point really shows is that there is no reason to believe one way or the other. But, so what?</p><p>Sometimes we have to guess in human life, and that‚Äôs okay.</p><p>We can make pragmatic moves in epistemology.</p><p>Consider a case in which I have to leap from a burning building into one of two dumpsters, or I‚Äôm going to die in the fire. Perhaps I know that one of the dumpsters will be a cushion and the other is filled is glass (presumably killing me), but I don‚Äôt know which is which.</p><p>Presumably, it is pragmatic and prudent to make a guess. I‚Äôm justified in guessing. It is rational to take one side, or to take the other. I‚Äôm not more justified in one or the other, but I‚Äôm justified in taking one of them.</p><p>Can‚Äôt the Cosmologist come back and say, ‚Äúwell, you can accept that rationally, but I can also deny it, rationally.‚Äù We are both justified.</p><p>This lacks the same oomph, since the cosmologist would prefer an argument for the existence of God that extends to all intuitions. But, at the very least, I think the cosmologist can respond to this criticism by turtling up, and recognizing that the best he can do is justify his own belief, and not much more.</p><p>Responses to Criticisms</p><p>1st: Rowe grants the Stamp mistake, and thinks ‚Äúit is very likely a mistake to think that the collection of dependent beings is itself a dependent being.‚Äù</p><p>Just because the Cosmologist thinks the collection of dependent beings needs an explanation is not sufficient grounds for concluding the collection is itself a dependent being.</p><p>This only seems to be a great criticism is we deny the first premise (which if we denied it, would already be the end of the argument).</p><p>What‚Äôs the other option? If we accept the First premise (every being is either dependent or self-existent), then the other option is that the series itself is self-existent.</p><p>This is an odd move.</p><p>At first glance, I‚Äôm tempted to think anything which being constituted by dependent beings must itself be dependent, right?</p><p>If so, then this seems to be answer.</p><p>Hence, if we argue the series can‚Äôt be self-existent, but it is a being which requires explanation, then by the first premise, it must be a dependent being.</p><p>Rowe doesn‚Äôt do anything with this.</p><p>2nd: Attributes the following reasoning:</p><p>Every member of the collection of dependent beings has a cause or explanation</p><p>Therefore, the collection of dependent beings has a cause or explanation</p><p>I worry this is a kind of strawman. My bet is that the cosmologist is supporting the conclusion with more premises than just the 1st, and it is these premises which Rowe really needs to flesh out and criticize.</p><p>The examples of ‚Äúhaving a mother‚Äù or ‚Äúlightness of marbles‚Äù might be radically different predicates from ‚Äúwhether or not something is a being‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing a dependent being.‚Äù</p><p>I‚Äôm just not sure the analogy follows.</p><p>Rowe doesn‚Äôt think the Cosmologist even needs to use this inference.</p><p>Instead, the positive ‚Äúfact that there exists a collection of dependent beings‚Äù requires immediately requires an explanation by the PoSR. No other inference is required.</p><p>Thus, this ‚Äúfact‚Äù move enables the PSR proponent to avoid the first two criticisms.</p><p>Although, I‚Äôm not convinced the PSR proponent must rely upon the second stage of the PSR, this ‚Äúfact.‚Äù They might be able to successfully diffuse these criticisms simply in terms of beings and metaphysics. If the Cosmologist can demonstrate the series is a being, then these two criticisms fail, even without appealing to the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù require an explanation move.</p><p>3rd: Rowe claims this reductive explanation critique rests upon an assumption the Cosmologist would not accept.</p><p>Assumption: ‚Äúto explain the existence of a collection of things it is sufficient to explain the existence of every member in the collection‚Äù</p><p>The 18th Century Cosmologist requires two conditions for explaining the collection of dependent beings:</p><p>C1: There is an explanation of the existence of each of the members of the collection of dependent beings</p><p>C2: There is an explanation of why there are any dependent beings.</p><p>I wonder if the ‚Äúcollection‚Äù itself is a being, is the explanation for it any different from this explanation?</p><p>The 3rd criticism claims that satisfying C1 results in or is the same as satisfying C2 (or C2 is reducible to C1)</p><p>Rowe gives us an examples of a self-existent being causing all the dependent beings. His intuition, from looking at these examples, is to agree with Cosmologist against the 3rd Critique.</p><p>Explaining each things individually doesn‚Äôt show why the whole is explained.</p><p>‚ÄúWhy are the dependent being at all?‚Äù just isn‚Äôt reducible on Rowe‚Äôs view.</p><p>The Truth of PSR</p><p>Rowe considers the final criticism and again outlines the argument.</p><p>To support the first Cosmological premise, the Cosmologist uses PSRa.</p><p>To support the second premise, the Cosmologist uses PSRb (about facts).</p><p>Essentially, we‚Äôve agreed to Cosmo premise 1, that for each being, it is either dependent or self-existent, then if every being were dependent (and hence there are no self-existent beings), then PSRb couldn‚Äôt be satisfied. Namely, there isn‚Äôt an explanation for the fact of the collection of dependent beings as a collective whole.</p><p>Here Rowe seems to accept the validity of all the chain of arguments. Now, his only attack is to argue either against the truth of the PSR (which he doesn‚Äôt seem to think is worthwhile), or that the PSR is unjustified.</p><p>Why should we believe the PSR?</p><p>Two defenses of the PSR:</p><p>PSR is intuitively true</p><p>Here, ‚Äúintuition‚Äù is associated with apodicticity, certain, and absoluteness.</p><p>It‚Äôs more than just being confident, or having evidence.</p><p>Once you ‚Äúfully understand and reflect‚Äù on the meaning of the PSR, then you must know it is true.</p><p>Knowing that every triangle has exactly 3 angles is something you know to be intuitively true. It is certain. It may even be known a priori.</p><p>Perhaps this would make the Cosmological argument rests upon a priori truth.</p><p>Similarly, my daughter might deny that .999 repeating is identical to 1, but upon further reflection of what .999 really is‚Ä¶you‚Äôll realize it must be identical to 1.</p><p>1/9 = .111</p><p>9 X 1/9 = .999</p><p>1 = .999</p><p>My daughter just didn‚Äôt fully understand the concept of .999 repeating.</p><p>Once she does, then she‚Äôll know it is certainly true. It is intuitively true at this stage.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that the opponents of the PSR will claim they fully understand the PSR, but still deny it. Something which is intuitively true is not doubtable if you really understand it (much like the Ontological argument). But, since the PSR is doubted, if the doubters really do understand the PSR, then the PSR is not intuitively true.</p><p>PSR is a presupposition of reason, a basic assumption of rational people</p><p>Even if we all presuppose something, that doesn‚Äôt make it true. It is possible the PSR is still false, and hence, possible that we can‚Äôt reach the Cosmological conclusion.</p><p>Unfortunately, Rowe was too quick, and left us with what I believe is a false dichotomy. The Cosmologist need not argue that this is a presupposition of reason (or that it is intuitively true).</p><p>Somehow, Rowe failed to really go after the justification of the PSR here.</p><p>It seems possible that the Cosmologist can argue that it the PSR is non-obvious, that it isn‚Äôt a presupposition of reason, but that, nevertheless, it is rationally justifiable to believe the PSR is true.</p><p>Rowe showed us only that the PSR might be false with this 4th criticism, but he did nothing to show why we aren‚Äôt or can‚Äôt be justified in believing it. But, that is exactly what he must do, since he‚Äôs agreed the argument chain from PSR to the 1st Cosmological Conclusion is valid.</p><p>Rowe concludes the Cosmological argument is valid, and it may even be sound, but that it might also be unsound (the premises, the PSR namely, may be false).</p><p>He thinks there is no good rational basis for believing the PSR.</p><p>Why should we agree to that though?</p><p>The Cosmologist has a lot of tools to defend themselves. Rowe and the Cosmologist may fundamentally disagree on what counts as rationality, rational acceptability, and justification. It does seem like the Cosmologist is in a good position to show how they are rationally justified though, even minimally, and that‚Äôs all they need to get past Rowe.</p><p>Note that all of this is for the 1st stage of the Cosmological argument. It is another argument to demonstrate why this special, self-existent being, the cause of all things, this unmoved mover, is the theist‚Äôs God. That said, the 2nd stage may or may not be a huge leap.</p><p>One of the brilliant things about the Cosmological argument is how it takes a serious, perhaps reasonable stance in metaphysics and epistemology which doesn‚Äôt seem to have anything to do with God in the first place, a seemingly secular foundation, and argues toward the existence of God.</p></div>
