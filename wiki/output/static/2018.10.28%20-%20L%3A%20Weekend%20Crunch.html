SAT 4:07 PM
=)
2 HR AGO
Shoot. Hey [[h0p3]]!
2 HR AGO
This is becoming a bad pattern.
2 HR AGO
Lol. How are you doing?
2 HR AGO
I worked basically all day yesterday. I’m mentally check out at this point.
2 HR AGO
=(
2 HR AGO
I'm sorry
2 HR AGO
And, it's totally okay that you are checked out. I would be too.
2 HR AGO
I am trying not to be whiney about it and it’s not working.
2 HR AGO
I just don’t like having to take this drama home with me. I always do my best to keep it during work hours and the fact that I have to take it home is driving me INSANE.
2 HR AGO
ah, well, I don't feel like it's whining. I have a moral problem with the fact that they cause you to feel forced to do it at home.
2 HR AGO
I want to bitchslap them.
2 HR AGO
That’s fair.
2 HR AGO
My boss just does not understand how bad this is.
2 HR AGO
It’s infuriating.
2 HR AGO
She’s all hunky dory about it because to her, as long as it’s not getting done the day before or day of it’s good.
2 HR AGO
Which is an AWFUL standard to have when working with a large group like this.
2 HR AGO
And also she’s not having to do the heavy lifting.
2 HR AGO
Awful for whom? =)
2 HR AGO
Oh, I have WoW running on muh PC. Your mom was fine with private or live. Gonna try to get it running on the chilluns computers as well.
2 HR AGO
Awful for everyone else and those who have to watch the presenters stumble through their presentations because they have no idea what’s happening...
2 HR AGO
Nice! :D
2 HR AGO
Is it a legacy server?
2 HR AGO
We could do that. They are on Zuljin.
2 HR AGO
They are indeed. Have been since day one.
2 HR AGO
I probably won't be sinking too much time, but I think it would be cool if the kids got to play with [[AG]].
2 HR AGO
(It’s sad that I remember that.)
2 HR AGO
Agreed. They probably have better game sense than [[AG]] though, unless her prowess has increased significantly since last I’ve watched her lol
2 HR AGO
You got me, I have no idea. I know [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] have almost no experience with MMO's. They hate grinding too. Still, I think they would enjoy the immersion, chat, etc.
2 HR AGO
lolol
2 HR AGO
I also used to hate grinding... still kinda do &gt;_&gt;
2 HR AGO
I can’t blame them
2 HR AGO
How’d your visit with [[AIR]] go? I will readily admit I have not been keeping up with your wiki as I should because of my minuscule free time.
2 HR AGO
I may end up botting, but not sure how that works in linux.
2 HR AGO
It was wonderful. I wish it could have been way longer.
2 HR AGO
We walked and talked a bunch.
2 HR AGO
Ate well, partied, watched The Big Lebowski.
2 HR AGO
It was tough to see him go.
2 HR AGO
I hate that I don't know when I'm going be able to see him again.
2 HR AGO
I can imagine...
2 HR AGO
I’m thrilled to hear you got some genuine time with him though.
2 HR AGO
He's a got a date tonight. He's gonna let me know how it goes after.
2 HR AGO
Ooooooooh
2 HR AGO
I hope he’s a good guy so we don’t have to break his legs.
2 HR AGO
lol
2 HR AGO
I mean — what? &gt;_&gt;
2 HR AGO
He's waiting for a heart transplant, graduate student in psychology, Jay is his name

2 HR AGO
=)
2 HR AGO
[[j3d1h]] installed linux on his laptop ($300 for i7, 16GB Ram, 256GB SSD, Discrete GPU, 1080p). He's been working on the command line today. That was neat.
2 HR AGO
Now you go making me sympathize with him. I see how it is. XD
2 HR AGO
I tease.
2 HR AGO
That hardware for that price?? Damn!
2 HR AGO
How’s he like it so far?
2 HR AGO
I think it's about the same. Setup TW and resilio sync for him too. [[j3d1h]] has been showing him around on it. I've gotta get Windows VM setup for him (synced over my template) just in case. Might setup WoW while I'm at it.
2 HR AGO
\o/
2 HR AGO
aye, gotta get some piracy going for him too
2 HR AGO
Give him ALL the things
2 HR AGO
That's my goal.
2 HR AGO
I don't want to him live on his phone except when its convenient.
2 HR AGO
I appreciate that you share all your resources with everyone you can. It’s very kind of you.
2 HR AGO
Right.
2 HR AGO
-lives on her phone all the time-
2 HR AGO
Though I have been using my computers more lately and I love it.
2 HR AGO
Have you been able to chill today?
2 HR AGO
I’m honestly forcing it today.
2 HR AGO
I do have work I could be doing, but I need a day off. I just can’t.
2 HR AGO
Good
2 HR AGO
My mind is rejecting it outright. I’m not about to force it.
2 HR AGO
Also this is a weird feeling. I haven’t felt this “anti-work” since I was a kid. XD
2 HR AGO
Ha. Fight the power.
