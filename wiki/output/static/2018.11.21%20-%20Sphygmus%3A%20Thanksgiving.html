<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Dear Madame Sphygmus,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">tl</sup></button></p><p><code>/hug</code>; It is good to see you again! </p><p>I hope the desert has been treating you well. I have seen you here and there from across the dunes, and I'm grateful to have the chance to sit down to have a conversation with you. I am convinced part of ancient leisure is the work of putting down my tentpegs <em>with</em> <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a>, building civilization, crafting <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Republic.html">The Republic</a>, and constructively finding our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> in the desert. I will say it again: you are community to me.</p><p>This letter has taken me longer to write than usual, and I'm not sure why. Sometimes my thoughts pour out with little friction or effort,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">fr</sup></button> but not this time. I don't know what that means or why, but thank you. I appreciate how you've sent me wandering into a deepthink in the desert, and as usual:<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">us</sup></button> I am grateful to your patience with me. You remind me yet again that conversation is an art (the form and practice of which I am still learning as an autist<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bs</sup></button>). It is true: you bring out and help me develop the best in me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Dear h0p3,</p><p>On the subject of watching my words unfold - I am definitely still playing with that! One of the letters has started as a draft on paper, with all its misspellings and scratch marks and so on. I'm drawn to that physical side of writing - I've always liked that the word &quot;inking&quot; is a part of &quot;thinking.&quot;
</p></blockquote><p>That is cool. Are you interested in calligraphy and the arts of physical letters as well? My children do not spend enough time in ink (a disservice to them), but I've been trying to change that. Unfortunately, my handwriting has devolved over the years (but my stick figure drawings look good); I can barely read it unless I'm purposely writing it for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a>. I hope writing my wiki will not similarly devolve.</p><p>In many cases, it's hard to beat paper (for the drawing, prototyping, and mutability especially); sometimes I feel less willing to make mistakes when I'm typing (and that is itself a mistake in many cases). I also like my notebooks, especially for work. Chalkboards and whiteboards go a long way for me too. I even got some fancy chalk for the chalkboard that covers the space above our fireplace (itself covered by HTPC's TV below); we like to decorate the house with chalk wallpaper or paint. Our glass backdoor usually has the larger cave drawings and neandrathalic algorithmic-visions painted in dry erase on it. Not everything is neatly digitized or forced onto a screen.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">c</sup></button> I wonder if that will change. I hope one day to feel so fluent with my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Monster-%25CE%25A6.html">Monster-Œ¶</a> that digital &quot;inking&quot; will be the same as digital thinking for me. I do not know if that day will come. I enjoy entertaining the transhumanists' claim we will think straight into our machines; sometimes I believe it too.</p><p>As always, I would like to know more about you in this respect. I want to practice thinking your thinking process.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I'm going to digress for a moment here and respond to the last three paragraphs in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Arr.html">Arr</a>, which I haven't yet touched on in any of my replies. Well - try to respond.
</p></blockquote><p>Those have been a powerful three paragraphs for me to re-read. You are living proof that I should have hope in the desert. Also, as always, please take as long as you'd wish; it may even rightfully be years before you address it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It is hard for me to <em>hear</em> your words about me because I am often immersed in my own negativity about myself. As a knot wrapped up inside me, that negativity is a thing only I can (in a slow-motion process) untangle. Your words feel good to read and are another lens to see myself through.
</p></blockquote><p>Perfectionists Unite! With our powers combined, we shall finally align our noble intentions and outcomes. I'm, uh, still working on this one myself, lol! I am indebted to your willingness to empathize with me. You make me feel less alone, and I'm glad I can be of use to you.</p><p>I am re-struck by some of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.08.29%2520-%2520Sphygmus%253A%2520Find%2520The%2520Others.html">your first words to me</a>: </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I worry that they would not stand up to your scrutiny.
</p></blockquote><p>It sounds like you scrutinize yourself quite a bit too. I have such mixed emotions on the topic. I look at the world around me and wish they would scrutinize themselves far more than they do, but at the same time, it is clear to me that some individuals are way too hard on themselves. =) Yeah, you got the bug. Without irony, I do not feel qualified to say much more here; I fear I will not escape that thought loop.</p><p>I appreciate that you take the time to write to me. Even my own extended family does not read what I have to say; to some non-trivial <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, they really don't care what I think. They don't take the time to engage me in writing either (I realize it is draining). I think you have balls/ovaries/fortitude necessary to be curious and actually try to connect at this level. You and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="kicks.html">kicks</a> make me see everyone else in my life differently. I hate to say it, but it barely feels like I get to be a human around most humans (though that itself may be part of the human condition).</p><p>I am glad that my words feel good to read! Though sometimes it can be hard to hear, I do not wish for my writing to be hard to hear <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwrongfrr.html">irwrongfrr</a> (and I am still thinking about what you have said); I hope to continually be a useful lens for you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">jr</sup></button> It is here in the desert that Reason is about respecting the dignity of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Other.html">The Other</a> in how we use each other as means (though not <em>mere</em> means) to each other as ends (or perhaps the final-means to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520End.html">The End</a>). I think this is an exercise of emergent and collaborative autonomy. I am grateful that you offer me the opportunity to understand both of us better than I could by myself. Again, you follow <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>; I wish the world was populated by people like you, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>. You actually give a shit even when it can sometimes overbearingly mean caring so much that it hurts.</p><p>Mutually empathizing with each <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="other.html">other</a> also gives us windows into ourselves through the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="other.html">other</a>'s lens.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I'm touched and honored by your desire to extend your personal information to me; I agree that it is a non-trivial gesture.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">dig</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Awesome! It took us a while to send it, but it was Thanksgiving. This time of year usually feels like a whirlwind.</p><p>It feels awesome to be able to extend it. I am overjoyed to trust you. It feels impossible to me, and I am still stunned by it. Despite trying to fix it, I only have two neighbors that know my name. My wife and I are among the few dozen people (dog owners) who even walk outside on the reg out of hundreds on top of our mountain (don't get me wrong; I'm a hermit that loves to stay in doors). Nobody seems to want to really know anyone else.</p><p>To the footnote: ROFL. You caught me with my pants down.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">det</sup></button> If you're talking about what I think you're talking about, that was a gorgeous drunken mistake.</p><p><code>/facepalm</code> </p><p>I have made a couple very large errors like that before. In fact, I found a ridiculously huge mistake very recently.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">m</sup></button> Lol. Adding to it, my daughter teases me quite a bit about that one time where I posted the private signature key (I clearly have no idea what I'm doing). I'm trying to take more precautions still, but I am forever doomed to make these mistakes.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bob</sup></button> It is hard to combat bots and trolls while remaining crucially vulnerable.</p><p>Snoop away on ol' voldy, lol. If that doesn't scare you away, I assume nothing will. Indeed, it is cringeworthy.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> I still have misgivings about it (not with you, obviously). There's a lot of ammo on that page. Keepin' it real with integrity is <em>so much fun</em> as the world burns down around me.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">n</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I'm also perfectly content to keep unfolding hyperconversations with each other. I would love for you to mail me your card! I am a sucker for the physical, especially when it comes to design. It would be meaningful to have.
</p></blockquote><p>Done!<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">time</sup></button> Everyone in the family made something for you. I can't say anything will be directly useful or your cup of tea. But, I thought a little bit of everyone's art would be cool.</p><p>I am glad to have our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hyperconversation.html">hyperconversation</a>s keep unfolding. This is awesome.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am okay with the breadcrumbs that remain. As you say, if people dig deep, we are already owned on that front. I may change from /<strong></strong>/sphygm.us after the domain expires, or I might not - I haven't decided yet. I am hosting it separate from my wiki and have <code>norobots</code> in the header, which are about the best measures I know to take for myself at the moment.
</p></blockquote><p>It would suck to lose your domain.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">as</sup></button> It fits your moniker so nicely! It may be a worthy thing to give up eventually, but I would want to hold onto it if I were you.</p><p>I've changed domains myself (you may already know that). It was originally: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://h0p3.xyz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://h0p3.xyz/</a>. I've thought about <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://h0p3.wiki/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://h0p3.wiki/</a>. Getting people to write numerals in the URL bar doesn't seem to work out (getting them to spell &quot;philosopher&quot; is already a leap). I also have no intention of tying myself down to any particular URL. I can never own a URL, but I can own a private key. I hope to at least have a reasonable plan for working around censorship (if ever such a thing were to happen to me).</p><p>I leave a small hole for <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://archive.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://archive.org/</a> in my robots.txt. I'm not sure what else to do either.</p><p>I think anonymous hosting and writing are fascinating problems. That is a rabbithole I enjoy going down in my paranoia, but I think it requires becoming a different person to exercise. I do not care for dissociating to any <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> more than is morally required of me. </p><p>Alright, I have a question that I don't feel I can aptly answer on your behalf: <strong>Who do you want to read your site, and why?</strong> Perhaps that should already be clear to me, but I remain open to the possibility your answer is in development (mine is!).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Oh! I am also extremely touched and honored by the revamped <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> page. Those are some incredible quotes you've included.
</p></blockquote><p>I thought you would like them. It's rare for me to represent someone with quotes, but they struck me in this case. Admittedly, there's significant work to be done in there, but that goes for everywhere on the wiki. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Clearly I need to dive into Dune as well.
</p></blockquote><p>It is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.11.22%2520-%2520Prompted%2520Introspection%253A%2520Dune%2520is%2520Winrar.html">my favorite fiction book</a>. Perhaps that will change though. My last reading of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Dune.html">Dune</a> did not dazzle me as much as it used to. I think I will wait a long time to read it again.</p><p>Do you have any books you think I should put on my reading list? Are there sites I need to hyperread to understand you (even indirectly)? I'm bad about this thing, but I hope to improve my process. It is important to me that I also come to understand you through the references that are vital to you (however you wish to reveal yourself). You already speak my language so absurdly well, and I feel like I am blindly trying to learn how to speak yours (I owe you that).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>In another connection to names, one of my pseudonyms online has been/is &quot;elanor.&quot; I first chose it from a book series I was all about in middle school, and then later realized:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Frodo thought for a moment. 'Well, Sam, what about elanor, the sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of Lothl√≥rien?'&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Names are funny things - they signify the being of ourself to others, yet in and of themselves there's nothing inherently <em>ours</em> other than some amount of legal force and habituation.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bit</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> In America we are given names at birth and generally hold onto them our whole lives; we have no secular rituals for shedding a childhood name and taking up the name of an adult. I would be fascinated to read a study of if and how screen names open up the way we form ourselves in relation to names. What are the many ways in which people relate to the idea of a &quot;username&quot;? (Especially now, with the rise of &quot;Log in with Facebook&quot; sites, rather than username driven sites.)
</p></blockquote><p>Oh. <code>/peers-into-the-sign</code>; you have said magic words to me, <em>Madame</em> <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">may</sup></button></p><p>You point to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Nameless.html">The Nameless</a> (possibly in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Other.html">The Other</a>)! You are the first nomad to name naming so clearly with me (though I have tried before); I am indebted to you.</p><p>I can only point and tremble before that blinding G√∂delian vortex. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Alias.html">Names</a> are funny, absurd, pointing to the impossible necessity of meaning, to that which we can only ever take up in uncertain faith. I adore your distinction between social convention and morality. I suggest you name The Desert of The Real; the Platonic Sun shines down on the reflective world around us to make its representation intelligible to we <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a>. The ancients attributed many powers to names, usually mere sorcery.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sy</sup></button> While I don't believe in sorcery, I cannot deny the fact that words are magical. To some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, we are a result of our names/words.</p><p>My names have evolved with me; I fear my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a> is littered with them. Before I was born as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a>, my previous primary names were <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4eak.html">4eak</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="gdoghomes.html">gdoghomes</a> (about one a decade since I was 12). Their shells still exist, but they are sublated now; they feel somehow partially hollow to me. This wiki is engaged in a different experiment: I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> to maintain my sublationary name, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a>, and instead engage in internal <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Self-Dialectic.html">Self-Dialectic</a> through <strike><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a></strike> <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ehyeh.html">ehyeh</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>. Yes, I know how crazy it sounds to emulate such a thing. Even worse, I'm not terribly good at fleshing out these characters, but I cannot say I understand myself all that well either. I'm still piecing together that dialogue (poorly); it is one of the fundamental narratives in this wiki. That wrestling has given rise to {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}. As crazy as that might sound, it's the only methodology I've got so far.</p><p>I would also be interested in that study. &quot;Logging in&quot; points to dualism and the ghost in the shell to me. At least part of my systematic perspective on freewill is quite unpopular in contemporary academic philosophy.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I have at least one friend I met online who, despite knowing his legal name, I still think of as his screenname. To me, that screenname signifies our connection, discussion, his personality, and who he is ‚Äì it feels incongruous to call him anything different. I expect I will keep thinking of you as h0p3 for the same reasons!
</p></blockquote><p>Ha! That's what we do too. We refer to you as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>, a member of our extended family that we choose. As an added bonus, I think your name is super fun to say; it rolls off the tongue for me. This is <em>mere</em> phonetic association, but it conjures &quot;<strong>Sph</strong>inx&quot; and &quot;En<strong>igma</strong>.&quot; Obviously, that is not how I assign the meaning, but I cannot deny there is a feeling I associate even just with the musical sound of words.</p><p>I enjoy having the chance to name myself. I feel more like myself as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a> than as my birthname.</p><p>How about you? You are far more a digital native than I am, I believe. I ask you to continue fleshing out your insight here. Perhaps we will need to hyperread. I will be thinking more about this.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Lately I've been thinking about names in another way. I'm noticing more and more times when other people will use my name, whether it's after I pick up a phone call and say my name, or if it's a more casual use by classmates or friends. And I notice that I don't use theirs to the same extent, if at all. It feels like a social deficiency on my part. I wonder what reproduces it, what socialization process I missed to not have this habitual name usage as an unconscious part of me.

Half of me is very grateful to have the chance to learn, and half of me thinks the institution is an abomination.</p><p>I take it you aren't rich, lol (doesn't seem like it to me: you give too much of a shit about people). Again, I understand this is a sensitive topic. I do not see you as failing at all. That bubble is hostile to us. You must have very strong mixed feelings about it.

I ask this question simply because I've been asked this question by so many people that I would like to be able to answer it, lol: what does your SO think about our penpalling? Further, do you think your SO would be interested in joining the hyperconversation we're having? I am interested to get to know him as well.</p><p>I have never participated in the scene, but I climbed the tracker world for a little while. I think I appreciate the incentivization problems. The ingroup/outgroup division justice principle, however, must be built on an open-ended, hospitable <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. All other strategies result in a game of perfect competition. I am unhappy with large sections of the piracy world because it aims to privatize <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwrongfrr.html">irwrongfrr</a>. The moral justification of piracy is to freely share and decentralize power. What has been built is wrong-headed to me directly because it centralized power, and I believe it is the result of market forces rather than goodwill.</p><p>We should be librarians to the world. I am academically and morally opposed to intellectual property;<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bd</sup></button> I wish we could decentralize the process for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> (I think highly of those projects which aim to be open even when they fail). To me, moderation and cataloging are human filtering processes, but they must never be centralized or made to benefit only the elite. I want to see tools that allow each of us to choose who we trust for moderation, curation, cataloging, and filtering across anonymized networks. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Atropos.html">Atropos</a> protocol is a beginning attempt (I may have to import the md plugin) at a high-performance network with the correct properties (would write the library in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Rust.html">Rust</a>). </p><p>Currently, I use the reviled: IPT, but I spend my seedboxes primarily on public trackers (since they are the moral approach to me). Nothing else seems to come close for a general tracker (which includes managing dozens of trackers), and it's much easier for my children to reason about a single tracker. Besides MAM and Empornium, IPT is the only tracker I actually use with any consistency. I used to keep others active, but over the years, I've just not seen the point. Other P2P options and Usenet were useful but have waned (Soulseek being this glorious living exception which is easier to use than tooling built on swarms). High-performance decentralization based upon the automated enforcement of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> strategy (per node) is the only scaling virtual private mesh network for the public which I think can defeat the monster I'm staring at.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Noted about Signal!

</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, I love deeper responses. It is tough to juggle and gauge which mediums are fitting. I'm still not sure how to mix instant messaging into our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hyperconversation.html">hyperconversation</a> effectively enough. I can say that most people seem to only engage me in instant messaging, and they don't seem to have any time or interest in long-form expressions or deeper empathic reasoning (but, that may be changing). I realize it is costly (though, I aim to repay it strongly). I will always prefer your long-form, systematic writing. But, surely, someone who spends time writing something which I prize so much should also be able to conveniently access me. I like having a variety of options with you too. =) Sometimes time is of the essence.</p><p>Maybe I have the wrong friends and family, lol. Half the people I know barely even try to read or write anything substantial; they act like they don't have time (but, I am not so convinced). Instant gratification drugs are simply too addictively convenient, and I don't think they want to own up to the shallowness (it's costly to do with all the pressures which surround us too). It turns out, being Human well is hard fucking work (it is my privilege to engage in it).

</p></blockquote><p>The semantic dam bursts when I rabbithole, and I mark it. It's a manic flowstate wherein I can't say everything I need to say (neither well-organized nor fleshed-out); significant moves in this wiki have resulted from this process (even though my wiki often represents what we think about very poorly). Phenomenologically, it is a triage: too much is happening at once, there are too many breakpoints and forks, too many waypoints we must come back to, and I often have explosions of tiddlers and hyperreading on my screen. </p><p>I often spend this time speaking in person since I cannot even get it out fast enough (I hope to eventually have solid speech-to-text). These sessions often amount to significant dialectics with my family wherein we rapidly wander a large network of thoughts together (I am a draining man to speak with in person at all times, but especially when I'm in the zone). I will often ask, &quot;why did we go down this path?&quot; or &quot;what started this?&quot; or &quot;where were we going?&quot; or step back through the conversation to continue the proof or exploration.</p><p>I aim to give my children a graduate school education in philosophy before they are 18 (they already startle the professors here). I shit you not (however insane it may sound): I aim to train my children to eventually become grandmasters in the study of wisdom (or get them as far as they can). Think the Polg√°r sister prodigies, but instead targeting a game I value above all others: the pursuit of wisdom (as always: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Virtue%2520is%2520Knowledge.html">Virtue is Knowledge</a>). Ofc, instrumentally, I want them to be solid computer users (they are a much further along than I was at their age), decent mathematicians (at least for logic, category theory, and perhaps those branches related to AI), and I hope excellent (deep and hyper) readers and writers. I hope I have enough time to equip and cultivate them with everything I can: the desert is dangerous.

Of course, I might be biased, but I think you have the best looking TW I've seen: it defeats the visual scaling problems excellently too. I do not understand why your work is not the default setting for TW. It's more than lipstick and rouge.

I will argue in full force (or not at all if you ask me to be silent) on your behalf. You are handling an obvious flaw in TW here: the default looks like shit compared to yours.
