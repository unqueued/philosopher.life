 What do you hope for me to learn from or wrestle with in this video?
15 minutes ago
 I will engage it with you, if you wish. I ask you to wrestle about it with me carefully.
13 minutes ago
 Hi [[h0p3]] I sent this to you it just because I miss [[h0p3]] who I used to ask about the Bible questions. I think you may know everything about the Bible already. I just wish to see someday... You will be great like the person who talked.
12 minutes ago
 I do ask about questions at the heart of Bible still.
12 minutes ago
 If you pay attention.
12 minutes ago
 I never ever want to wrestle with you at all.
12 minutes ago
 So, you can see why I think what you send me is preachy?
11 minutes ago
 I am willing to listen, but then you must also pay the same price to listen to me.
11 minutes agowh
 I will listen to you if you don't mind to use Simple language so it will be easier for me to understand please.
9 minutes ago
 Some things can't be communicated in simple language.
9 minutes ago
 That's kind of where I'm at.
9 minutes ago
 It will take work to understand what I have to say. There's not way around it. I will work hard to say it as clearly and simply as I can.
8 minutes ago
 So, here's a question: why should I agree to the authority of the Bible as the Word of God?
7 minutes ago
 I believe in the divine.
7 minutes ago
 I would not call myself an atheist, for example.
6 minutes ago
 How about you finished watching the video first?
4 minutes ago
 And then I can tell you why I sent this video to you.
3 minutes ago
 I will write about the video for you, madame. I expect you to address my hard work on your behalf.
2 minutes ago
 Right now I have to get ready to pick up the kids and then go to work. And I want to let you know from my heart that I always want to talk to you and asked you many questions. Love
1 minute ago
 After the video, of course =)</code></pre><p>Dear Jop,</p><p>I appreciate your willingness to think about what matters most with me. I aim to do you justice.</p><p>One problem in our dialectic<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">p</sup></button> is this mixture of our language barrier and knowledge gap. It's already difficult for the average native speaker to understand me; so, I applaud your courage and integrity to speak with me about this. There's no way around it: you will need to use a dictionary and google search to understand me. I can only simplify so much for you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button>  </p><p>Sending me your video <em>just is</em> wrestling with me. You say you don't want to wrestle, but your actions say the opposite. I must take you to task for it. On one hand, you claim I am knowledgeable about the Bible (and I suggest Christianity), and on the other hand, you send a video to change my mind, as though you (or Stanley) know better than I do (or somehow believe this is worth my time). I know the argument you are showing me, Jop. My dismissal of the argument is not an accident.</p><p>I appreciate that you believe I should change, but I would say the same to you. If you expect me to be open to being wrong here, then you need to be willing to be wrong here as well. I get that you aim to question whether I have the right to believe what I do (though, I think you have no idea what I believe); be prepared to answer the same accusation. Are you ready? </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hi <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a> I sent this to you it just because I miss <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a> who I used to ask about the Bible questions. I think you may know everything about the Bible already. I just wish to see someday... You will be great like the person who talked.
</p></blockquote><p>I think another problem (or another version of the original) is that you're mistaken about who or what you miss. I suggest you only understood a poor semblance of what I was thinking and experiencing when you lived with us, and that's okay to some huge extent (for a variety of reasons). I think you have the wrong picture of who I was back then (I've had problems with the argument Stanley presents for a long time) and who I am today, but that too cannot be fully remedied, understandably. I'm convinced you miss someone who didn't actually exist; you have misunderstood me from the beginning.</p><p>I see you don't think I'm a great person, and I appreciate your desire to fix me. In my initial defense: even if I'm not great, I still think I'm a good man (I work incredibly hard to be as virtuous as I can), and I think my willingness to change my mind is part of why I'm a man of integrity.</p><p>I must correct you again: I do talk about Biblical concerns at great length and depth, you just don't realize it. You have no right to claim I have not been doing so. I think you want me to talk about the Bible in a particular way that fits your worldview, but that's not identical to honestly asking and answering religious questions. I'm not here to confirm your bias or mine. I am here to find the truth, even if it hurts. Are you ready to do the same? </p><p>So, I know you've switched from Buddhism to Christianity. I have evolved as well. Are you open to the possibility there's a perspective more correct than Christianity? Are you even open to radically altering your very understanding of Christianity itself? My move away from Christianity is in virtue of trying to make sense of my faith.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>How about you finished watching the video first?
</p></blockquote><p>If you think I'm knowledgeable about what's in the video already (and I am to some extent), then why not have the discussion with me on the spot? I'm not convinced I should have to watch the video to discuss this with you, but I aim to generously demonstrate to you that I will bend over backward to think carefully about your words (and videos), and that's exactly why I have the right to require you think carefully about mine. It's <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>. I am worried you aren't interested in trying to understand what I actually believe or why. This does look like you are preaching to me; are you sure it isn't you who should be listening to me instead?</p><p>I prefer to have the chance to think about the speaker, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Andy%2520Stanley.html">Andy Stanley</a>, and given his argument, I think he should agree with my trying to understand the context of who said it. </p><p>It may help if you watch the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRp2-AeYs9A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> alongside my commentary:</p><p>It opens with lullaby rhetoric. &quot;Listen up, kids.&quot;</p><p>The historiographies and transformation of the Bible, the surrounding literature, and its place in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Great%2520Human%2520Conversation.html">The Great Human Conversation</a> are clearly important. Canonization and translation are fascinating problems in understanding the Bible. Stanley is correct thus far. </p><p>He states the &quot;Stories of&quot; vs &quot;Stories in&quot; The Bible dichotomy. It seems at least conceptually possible that we could justifiably discount the Bible even without understanding the story-of. It might also be just as easy to discount The Bible directly because you know the historical story-of it. He makes no room for this.</p><p>He implies that if you don't know the story-of The Bible then you are aren't justified in denying its authority. That, of course, is something which he has to argue for, and he doesn't get to help himself to it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The way we got our bibles is not the way the world got The Bible.
</p></blockquote><p>Who and what is &quot;the world&quot; and &quot;The Bible&quot;? What is the difference between saying we have Bibles and &quot;The Bible&quot; universal? Why should I agree to such a thing? It seems like &quot;The Bible&quot; is the progressively evolving document and surrounding discussion in Humanity, and our bibles are just timeslices of that larger 4-Dimensional discussion.</p><p>He's connecting with the audience about bible ownership. This is a rhetorical tactic. The goal is to conjure emotions that make his argument more believable. I think there is an appeal to nostalgia here and an attempt to make sense of our childhood in a way that is pleasurable (even if its wrong).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>All of us carry our childhood perspective of The Bible into adulthood.
</p></blockquote><p>I learned what he's talking about in childhood. Yes, that information has been important to me even in adulthood (though that doesn't mean I agree with it). I want to make sure that we make a distinction between &quot;carrying&quot; it with us statically and evolving our understanding of that perspective. My opinion has changed over time for good reason.</p><p>It's not the parts of The Bible that people skipped over that bothered me (except when they didn't attempt to live up to it). As a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Straussian.html">Straussian</a>, I have been able to be incredibly charitable in my progressive revelation interpretation of The Bible. It still doesn't hold water. Note, of course, that this argument of walking away from The Bible because others were skipping parts of it is addressing the story-in rather than the story-of.</p><p>I disagree with Stanley's account of the story-of The Bible. His chronology is wrong. The Bible doesn't begin with Jesus. I've seen plenty of Christocentricism. I know this schtick.</p><p>The author of the Gospel of Luke may be an influential reason why we have The Bible today, but he clearly isn't the beginning. You don't get to dismiss the Old Testament like that, and you certainly can't understand the NT without the OT. Coherentifying them is the task of Biblical studies and Theology (tasks for every Christian).</p><p>The story of Luke and Theophilus, of course, are stories. Why should we believe these stories are accurate? Why should I even agree Luke is who you are telling me, why should I think Luke is trying to tell me the truth, and why should I think Luke has the truth? Stanley has to vigorously explain and justify these problems.</p><p>You don't get to turn to &quot;Luke 1:1 NIV&quot; (NIV is considered garbage by scholars) to justify Luke. The authority of The Bible cannot be emitted from itself. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Something had happened worth documenting.
</p></blockquote><p>Why should I agree to this? You have to defend that claim, and you don't get to just help yourself to it.</p><p>Just because many people attempted to tell similar stories doesn't mean those stories are about something non-fictional, and even if they were attempts at non-fiction, that doesn't make the accounts accurate. I have profound doubts about human memories and motivations, and I don't see why I shouldn't be just as doubtful in this case. Just because lots of people may have said something before didn't make it true then and it doesn't make it true now.</p><p>Furthermore, just because there aren't many remaining examples of occurrences of multiple people trying to talk about a similar supposed event does not mean we should take The Bible to be authoritative. In fact, that there aren't many remaining examples of this kind of process doesn't mean there haven't been many which didn't survive (for whatever reasons). Ultimately, the survival of a text is not a justification for its authority.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">j</sup></button></p><p>I should point out: there is at least a handful of competing major holy texts in this world which have many authors through history doing very similar work to The Bible. Even the Quran and its body of literature seem to have plenty of causal similarities with how The Bible was written. What's wrong with the Quran? More problematically, I don't see how Stanley is going to be able to use this argument for the authority of The Bible when it also justifies the Quran and other competing holy texts.</p><p>Stanley's argument that Luke claims to be telling the truth doesn't mean Luke was accurate (even if he was as honest as possible), nor that Luke was being honest, nor that Luke even existed. Stanley's telling people who already believe or want to believe what they want to hear, but that doesn't make his argument a good one.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Luke was not writing The Bible. He had no idea this [bible] would exist.
</p></blockquote><p>That's true, but you still don't get to help yourself to the claim that Luke is creating &quot;an orderly account of Jesus' life.&quot; Even if you get to say it appears like that, appearances can be deceiving. This is not a justification of the authority of scripture.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>[Considering Luke 23:56 NIV] everyone expected Jesus to stay dead...in this moment, there are no Christians...there are no Jesus followers...there is no church
</p></blockquote><p>That's quite a claim. It's not clearly true. It seems obvious to me that those who honor and remember the dead, especially insofar as they take themselves to be practicing his teachings, might be called followers. Why should I agree to Stanley's claim?</p><p>There is a difference between the claim that these people didn't feel like they were Christians in that moment and the claim that they weren't Christians. I suggest Stanley is mistaken in his interpretation of both the story-of and the story-in The Bible here.</p><p>So, I playfully argue about the beginning of Judaism with my wife often, and I'm not convinced Stanley can just help himself to the claim that Jesus' followers weren't Christians at that moment. The very definition of the Body of Christ, of the Church, seems to include those people in that moment. If you think salvation is made possible directly through the death of Jesus Christ, then we should take seriously (on this story's grounds) that these people are saved, believing and behaving as followers of Christ, as members of a new Christian order grafted into the older chosen tree.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The Jesus movement had been crushed out of existence...if it had ended there, there would be no &quot;The Bible&quot; and there would be no Christians...there would be no Old Testament.
</p></blockquote><p>So, I don't think Jesus was resurrected, and in fact, I do think the story of his resurrection (alongside his divinity) is completely fictional. That cultivated fiction just is the Jesus movement! The reason the story didn't end there isn't that Jesus is God incarnate but because a group of people decided to write fiction or a hearsay account of another's fiction. Stanley avoids this entirely.</p><p>The simple claim that there would be no &quot;The Bible&quot; as it exists today unless people wrote it and passed it on is correct, but Stanley is helping himself to far more. That there wouldn't be an Old Testament as we have in our bibles today unless historical people passed it along is an obvious fact about all historical texts (biblical or otherwise). The survival of a text, again, however, is not a justification of its authority, truth, or coherence. I actually think that even if there were no Jesus, there's a non-trivial chance that the Talmud would still exist. Stanley's moving fast and making grand claims, but that doesn't mean he's right.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Luke documented the life of Jesus, because the story of Jesus didn't end on a Roman cross.
</p></blockquote><p>Why should we think Luke has documented the life of Jesus at all (let alone as systematically as Stanley claims)? Why should I agree the story of Jesus as told the author we call Luke is an accurate representation of the events that unfolded in reality? Note how the story of Jesus continues to evolve as a memeplex through human history, but that doesn't mean the story is about something which happened, nor does it mean The Bible is epistemically justified.</p><p>Preaching is often an emotional, guttural, rhetorical activity in which the preacher manipulates the audience through what appears to be reason but is actually a sequence of words designed to make you hold a belief without logical justification. This video is propaganda.</p><p>Unfortunately, Stanley repeated tells the story-in The Bible as the story-of The Bible. He conflates them underhandedly. </p><p>Just because secular scholars agree the Christian memeplex has been influential does not make it the memeplex valid, sound, honest, justified, or authoritative.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Why would Luke, and why would others, feel so compelled to document the events that happened in the first century surrounding the city of Jerusalem? And, the answer is undeniable: because something extraordinary has happened.
</p></blockquote><p>I can point to plenty of groups of people today who tell false stories together. That lots of people agree to something doesn't make it true, nor does it justify our belief in it in our context, nor does it make it the account authoritative in general.</p><p>Of course Stanley's assumption is deniable: I'm doing it right now.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This was a message for the whole world.
</p></blockquote><p>That doesn't mean the message is correct. That doesn't mean The Bible is authoritative. There are many messages meant for the world in history, and there are many holy texts with rich histories like The Bible. Stanley has not justified why we should take The Bible seriously outside of the fact that it has been influential, and he's not handled any of the competing claims to authority.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>my faith is still intact not based upon what I see around me now, but based upon someone I met and what I saw
</p></blockquote><p>Why should I not think this is a confabulation? Humans are incredibly good at rationalizing and creating fictions of who they are and what they saw to conveniently fit their needs at the present time. Why should we not think the authors of The Bible weren't engaged in writing fiction (even unknowingly)?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>John 20:31 NIV, But these are written that you...and do you know who &quot;you&quot; is? You is you. And, you is me. And, you is all of us...he has no idea if it will survive a day.
</p></blockquote><p>Just because the author didn't know who would read it, and just because the text has survived and been disseminated does not make it authoritative. I sound like a broken record, but Stanley continues to deliver the same rhetoric. Survival and popularity is not justification in itself.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>What is the &quot;it&quot; that you don't believe?
</p></blockquote><p>I don't believe The Bible is the Word of God, an authoritative scripture, an accurate depiction of history, anything more than a collection of non-trivially fictionalized accounts and perspectives of many authors, canonizers, translators, and transmitters. Insofar as I respect The Bible as a cultural and historical artifact, it is because it presents to us <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> (the two greatest commandments). But, frankly, there are other scriptures and texts which do this as well, and some of them far more effectively than The Bible. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If John's account is all you have, John's account is all you need.
</p></blockquote><p>That is insane. Why should anyone agree to that? This is some catchy rhetorical virus that has no basis in reason. </p><p>Listen carefully to what he's saying: the story-of The Bible is irrelevant; it's only John's story-in what is now The Bible that you need. Stanley is contradicting himself. Originally, Stanley's argument was that the reason we aren't justified in not believing in the authority of story-in The Bible is that we've not been educated about the story-of The Bible. He goes the opposite direction here. Of course, I think studying the story-of The Bible is actually one of the justified reasons to doubt its authority.  Setting that aside, however, look, here he outright even denies the need to know the story-of The Bible. He now claims the argument for the justification of authority of The Bible rests on the story-in The Bible itself, and that circular reasoning itself is not justified.</p><p>Beware those who openly contradict themselves.</p><p>Stanley goes on to tell us a tale about growing up, to personalize himself and listening to stories passed down through the generations. The preciousness of the book here is not in virtue of its contents. This is a sleight of hand, and it's an appeal to tradition (a fallacy).</p><p>That some Christians were persecuted for their texts and beliefs doesn't make it The Bible authoritative. Plenty of other competing religions have had followers who died for their texts and beliefs as well. Many people have died with false beliefs and poor justification. This, again, is an appeal to tradition.</p><p>Let me be clear, I think Stanley is a strawman. But, it turns out that most of the criticisms here are still not going to be answerable by even Biblical and Theological scholars who actually merit our respect. </p><p>Alright, so there you go. That is my dissection of this charlatan's argument. Part of our disagreement, Jop, is that I think epistemic justification begins well before we can even begin talking about these historical stories, the authority of the scriptures, and Christianity as a cultural phenomenon in our species. My denial of your belief rests upon a denial of what sits underneath and around it. I'm not a Christian in virtue of my knowledge. I didn't walk away without profound reason.</p><p>I hope you will think very carefully about my words. Perhaps you will need some time to address it.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">p : </span> This is the best word for it!</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">d : </span> I will defend myself against an accusation of using meaningless fancy words or 'just playing semantics'.
