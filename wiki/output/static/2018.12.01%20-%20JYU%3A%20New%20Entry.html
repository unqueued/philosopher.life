<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I made a new entry with this text, but not sure if it made it. Feel free to add it to your wiki if I didn't do it right:</p><p>I will try using this interface, please forgive any faux pas that I may make in your digital brain.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I hope those connections grow substantially. I don't have a lot of examples to look at to know how to do this well, so I'm winging-it and wandering the desert in the dark.
</p></blockquote><p>Imagine if everyone had a wiki like this and your proliferous nature. A similar notion is if everyone had the time and space to write a novel. The world would be a richer place, indeed. But perhaps it has already happened: a person‚Äôs Facebook page is an autobiographical book, one post at a time, although intermediated through a corporation.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I'm sorry if you might find my work inscrutable or lacking immediate gratification.
</p></blockquote><p>The comment about wiki‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt instigated by yours, but rather, SCP foundation <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.scp-wiki.net/</a>. It's is a very interesting narrative made through ‚Äúfound‚Äù artifacts, but I wasn‚Äôt going for this in particular for my list. More on this below.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>In any case, ergodicity may include more than the concept of linearity.
</p></blockquote><p>This is an excellent point. Ergodicity and difficulty of reading do not necessarily correlate one-to-one. There are some novels which have topsy turvy timelines that are more difficult to parse than some non-ergodic texts. This is something I need to think more on.</p><p>I agree: some works like Asimov and Dune require intensive reading even in ergodic formats. I come from a world where I‚Äôve created products and experience at scale (millions of people), so that is lens which I bring to hyperliterature. What is the next step after novels? I believe it will be something iterative that is easily ingestible, yet allows a new layer of richness. Accessibility is paramount to making any new medium a success. Some may think this ‚Äúlow brow‚Äù but new mediums needs the success of low brow content before it can take off.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I have been thinking about and trying to model you for myself. You appear to have a significant background in Music.b Why'd you move away from acoustics?
What did you think of working at FB, and why don't you work there anymore?
</p></blockquote><p>I am a peculiar human in that I reset myself every four years or so. I like to become a novice again, learning a whole different skill. I am multi-hyphenate. </p><p>My journey thus far has been: signal processing and acoustics -&gt; web developer -&gt; designer -&gt; startup founder -&gt; product manager -&gt; fiction writer. </p><p>In this modern age of specialization I am somewhat of an anomaly. It‚Äôs not an easy road, but it is what I love to do. </p><p>Why did I leave Facebook? Because I wasn‚Äôt learning new things anymore. Pretty simple. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Do you think your interest in science fiction has caused you to be interested in philosophy?
</p></blockquote><p>Yes! In short, all authors who writing fiction end up asking the tough philosophical questions.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I adore your book choices. Do you have any other recommendations?
</p></blockquote><p>Not at the moment. I‚Äôm only putting books that are deeply impactful on that list. Of course, it‚Äôll evolve as I read more.</p><p>James Yu</p></div>
