<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Wee Essay from her to some research facility she shared with me:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I experienced a relatively severe shift in SES in my childhood. I was born and raised on Long Island (both my parents were New Yorkers). At the time I was born, my mother worked in advertising for a big newspaper and I would say we were solidly 'middle class'. We weren't rich by any means, but my parents took us on at least one holiday a year and we ate out frequently, as an example. I was an only child and a bit spoiled as my parents could afford (or so they thought) to get me most of what I wanted.</p><p>When I was four my mother tried to take her own life, after which she was put on mental health benefit and has never worked since. At that point my father, who was a 'blue collar worker' as they call them in the States, got a job as a maintenance man at a local shopping plaza. At this point our SES did decrease a bit, but my parents made few changes in terms of their spending.</p><p>Then several years later, when I was about 9, there was a bit of a market crash (this would be around 1990/91?) that especially affected 'blue collar' workers. This was the point at which our SES substantially, and permanently, changed. My father was laid-off from his job and despite honestly searching, could not find a replacement. This resulted in perhaps the poorest period of my life during which my mother and I had to get food from food banks and she had to write 'rubber cheques' to pay bills.</p><p>The biggest outcome of that change in SES was that we relocated from Long Island to Kentucky; essentially, very poor in New York is only average/regular poor in Kentucky. My dad had a few jobs over the years, always manual labour, never earned very much. The 'rubber cheques' continued and we struggled a lot at times.</p><p>As you can see, this impacted literally every area of my life, including culturally because of the huge move we did to another part of the country. I was 10 when we moved to Kentucky and that in itself was massive because I initially did not want to go (though as an adult years later I am so glad we did!); also, my family is Jewish and neither Jews nor yankees (in the States that refers only to people from the north) are particularly welcome in Kentucky. You can extrapolate from that but to make a long story short, yes, I was persecuted by both peers and adults for being Jewish.</p><p>I was also persecuted at times for being poor (peers would make fun of my hair and joke I had no shampoo to wash it and so on) even though poor people are pretty common there.</p><p>Obviously all of the persecution/abuse was a serious negative, and it does all trace back to our change in SES, mostly because of the relocation aspect. That said, there have been many positive things in my life because of this ever since. I think most strongly is the recognition I've had (aided by my higher education) that capitalism is one of the most harmful and negative institutions on this planet. It is the root of almost everything that is wrong, every problem, every inequality. It is also the reason all of those things keep getting exponentially worse instead of improving. In my heart I am an anarchist, but I identify as socialist because it seems the best chance our species has at the current point in time.</p><p>I acknowledge that I've become classist, as well. I have no love for rich or wealthy people, ESPECIALLY those who were born into it. I sometimes refer to the need to 'bring out the guillotines', and I'm not joking.</p><p>As you can see, the change in SES massively impacted my life, even my personality, and the way I see things in the world. The way I judge some things to be good or bad, fair or unfair, and the way I judge people in a lot of contexts, including where they live, what they own, how and where they spend their money and which political parties they support.</p><p>Even though none of these things are 'positive' in the sense that they're not fun, they're not happy, they do not aid a rosy view of the world, they have been essential in shaping my views and in teaching me the truth about what's going on in the world. I would rather be poor and angry, in fact, than well-off and so bloody ignorant about the harm my lifestyle causes others.
</p></blockquote><pre><code>what makes a good canon? well, i've never really thought about it. I would guess that it's quite a subjective thing, really.
6 hours ago
 my MLitt is in 'Continental Philosophy'
6 hours ago
 but it's a load of pish, really
6 hours ago
 basically, I didnae want a masters, but I realised the only way to get back into scotland for any amount of time was as a student
6 hours ago
 so i had alook about and dundee uni had this course, Art &amp; Aesthetics
6 hours ago
 it was being done in collaboration by the philosophy dept and the art school
6 hours ago
 as i started off as an art student I was really excited about it, actually
6 hours ago
 about a month before i left the states i got a letter saying that the art school had pulled out, so it was just going to be theory (not the mix of theory and application/fine art it was meant to be)
6 hours ago
 so i was a bit disappointed but, whatever, becaus at that point i'd have done a degree in shite-shoveling if it got me back to scotland lol
6 hours ago
 so i got here, and my first day  of 'class', i go to the place
6 hours ago
 and there's one other woman, about 2 years older than me maybe
6 hours ago
 and they're like okay
6 hours ago
 so we're not offering that degree anymore
6 hours ago
 but you can do continental philosophy with Jean, here
6 hours ago
 I was like, eh?
6 hours ago
 you can do that?
6 hours ago
 but again, just wanted to be in scotland so didnae argue
6 hours ago
 as it turned out, they didnae have the resources to offer the continental philosophy course, either
6 hours ago
 the first term i was  put into some womens studies modules
6 hours ago
 and the second i did 'self-directed study'
6 hours ago
 it's all a load of horse shite
6 hours ago
 basically, because the only people they can financially rip off are foreigners, that's what they do
6 hours ago
 and they (not just dundee uni, lots of places) put on courses to get people (and their money)
6 hours ago
 that they honestly have no right to be offering
6 hours ago
 but, whatever. it's all behind me now
6 hours ago
 like i say, got some feminist stuff out of it that was good
6 hours ago
 but otherwise it was just an expensive stressful hassle that had to be overcome
6 hours ago
 =(
3 hours ago
 That sucks.
3 hours ago
 i had to threaten my dad with jail, too
2 hours ago
 to get my student loans
2 hours ago
 he'd run up debt using my name
2 hours ago
 they told me that's why i couldn't get the student loans
2 hours ago
 and obv the whole point was student loans
2 hours ago
 they said it either had to be paid in full or I had to put him jail (charge him with identity theft)
2 hours ago
 so i phoned and said you need to find $1000 to pay that phone bill you ran up in my name
2 hours ago
 or i'm putting you in jail
2 hours ago
 i am going to scotland either way
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 true story bro
2 hours ago
 haha
2 hours ago
 he found the money somewhere
2 hours ago
 and those loans are now many years in default
2 hours ago
 preach
2 hours ago
 in a shitty country i will never re-enter
2 hours ago
 I am a 65k now.
2 hours ago
 oh i think mine were about 70k and that was years ago
2 hours ago
 School is expensive.
2 hours ago
 it should be fucking free
2 hours ago
 PREACH
2 hours ago
 especially considering how little it's worth now
2 hours ago
 i mean, when i was a bairn a Masters was a big deal
2 hours ago
 now, you ain't nothing if you ain't got a PhD
2 hours ago
 and even then you're gonnae struggle
2 hours ago
 well, I think mine is priceless, but I get your meaning
2 hours ago
 well you know what i mean, aye! lol
2 hours ago
 it's like they taught our generaiton YOU MUST GO TO COLLEGE
2 hours ago
 but now it doesn't mean that much, at least in terms of what it did then, i.e. gauranteeing a job etc
2 hours ago
 fuck i misspelled guaranteeing
2 hours ago
 anyway
2 hours ago
 must've been doing the southern version
2 hours ago
 =)
2 hours ago
 I GAH-run-tee
2 hours ago
 haha
2 hours ago
 I agree we were lied to about college; it's a business which people have been convinced is only useful for signaling to get a job. The goal was to flood the market with overqualified people so they could pay them as little as possible. College is necessary to even have a chance of winning the lottery now.
2 hours ago
 I am surprised you don't value what you learned in your masters.
2 hours ago
 I can see they jerked you around.
2 hours ago
 oh, no, i do value what i learned
2 hours ago
 I love how much you hate Capitalism. =) I don't have many people I can talk to around here in Tennessee who can relate.
2 hours ago
 it just overall was not a good time
2 hours ago
 haha
2 hours ago
 well call on me any time
2 hours ago
 fucking hate the shit
2 hours ago
 in fact, yesterday i participated in an academic research study
2 hours ago
 about social economic status
2 hours ago
 they made you write a wee essay
2 hours ago
SES shift - academic study.docx
13.93 KB
2 hours ago
 in fact, i don't understand how anyone can argue for capitalism
2 hours ago
 because the only aspects of it that aren't shite, where they are applied
2 hours ago
 are fucking socialism!
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 aye, the college thing tho ... i think it's a shame, too, that so much emphasis was always put on the job aspect
2 hours ago
 it's such a valuable thing for a young person to go do
2 hours ago
 whoever they are, wherever they are, whatever they do (or don't) study
2 hours ago
 it's just good for people
2 hours ago
 which is another reason it should be free
2 hours ago
 invest in people, people build a better society
2 hours ago
 of course, the imperial masters have no interest in a better society cause it's all fine as it is for them
2 hours ago
 *shrug*
2 hours ago
 That's a moving wee essay.
2 hours ago
 most people are evil, that's why they argue for capitalism
2 hours ago
 they need the slaves, yo
2 hours ago
 considering how common a thing it seems to be for people to want control over other people, maybe i'm not quite as human as I appear? lol
2 hours ago
 i don't actually want to control anyone
2 hours ago
 if folk coul go and make a capitalist country somewhere and only people who wanted to be there were there, it'd be fucking fine with me
2 hours ago
 not me
2 hours ago
 just let the rest of the species get on with, like, living and evolving and improving
2 hours ago
 if it were a situation where they coudlnae harm everyone else, I'd not care
2 hours ago
 they can go fucking hump and slit each other's throats
2 hours ago
 i really dinnae care
2 hours ago
 AN YE HARM NONE, DO WHAT YE WILL
2 hours ago
 ok that's harm, i realise
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 so i've just contradicted mysef
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 i'm conflating two different issues, really
2 hours ago
 sorry, i'm a bit distracted...
2 hours ago
 it's past 6 and i've still not had a pipe nor a meal
2 hours ago
 ed is taking AGES
2 hours ago
 i mean, he's doing shit needs doing, but still
2 hours ago
 he told me 'an hour' at 15:20
2 hours ago
 haha
2 hours ago
 he has NO sense of time, sometimes, it does my nut in
2 hours ago
 It seems to me that any capitalist country will have slave labor, and that gives them the competitive advantage over those who don't have slave labor. Market forces will always reward the psychopath for boxing without golden-rule gloves.
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 i suppose you're right
2 hours ago
 i was just trying to illustrate that i dinnae give a fuck about telling people what to do
2 hours ago
 but i suppose maybe i do a wee bit ;) lol
2 hours ago
 guess it depends what it is
2 hours ago
 capitailsm is evil, true
2 hours ago
 whereas other things, like what people want to eat/drink/smoke/swallow/fuck and so on, are nae cunt's business
2 hours ago
 (as long as it's all with CONSENT of course ;)
2 hours ago
 I agree to the gist of the claim. I suggest that informed consent is a quagmire when you look closely at it.
2 hours ago
 (I'm an annoying bastard)
2 hours ago
 haha
2 hours ago
 so ya are! lol
2 hours ago
 lol =)
2 hours ago
 but i suppose also, yes
2 hours ago
 you're right
2 hours ago
 just go and fuck up all of my short-answer non-committal generalisations, why don't ye :P
1 hour ago
 haha
1 hour ago
 SIGH
1 hour ago

1 hour ago
 Have fun, ttyl
1 hour ago

1 hour ago

1 hour ago
