This fundamental problem never seems to go away. It rears it's ugly head time after time, context after context. It's at the center of being conscious, of knowledge, of the nature of reality of our realities, and perhaps what epistemic standards we use for determining the nature of reality itself.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>To this [transcendental] idealism is opposed transcendental realism, which regards space and time as something given in themselves (independent of our sensibility). The transcendental realist therefore represents outer appearances (if their reality is conceded) as things in themselves [Dinge an sich selbst], which would exist independently of us and our sensibility and thus would also be outside us according to pure concepts of the understanding. (A369)
</p></blockquote><p>Well, of course spacetime is independent of our sensibility, of our minds, and are real in themselves. That's the axiomatic faith of induction. One must start with these priors and innate reasons, and to question that turtle poorly will cost you everything. Look, let me grant you can never be certainly justified; the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="infinigress.html">infinigress</a> owns you. G√∂del and Wittgenstein are going to buy you the sufficiently aletheically sound justification for the prudential epistemic reason to be dialetheist enough to have faith in the absurd. It's real, even if you don't really know what it means to say it, and you know you can never really prove it.</p><p>I am, therefore, a transcendental realist. I think we experience that which is outside us, can finitely point at it, fallibly show it, experience it somehow, and even know it, about it, or of it in some crucial way. I really do think it's external to my mind, and it's not non-sensical to claim that. I have a faith that the transcendental is real. Logic itself forces me to agree. I have no choice but to have faith in reality, I am frozen into meaninglessness without it. There, my friend, is the real transcendental question-begging: what the fuck really got you out of bed this morning?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>We have sufficiently proved in the Transcendental Aesthetic that everything intuited in space or in time, hence all objects of an experience possible for us, are nothing but appearances, i.e., mere representations, which, as they are represented, as extended beings or series of alterations, have outside our thoughts no existence grounded in itself. This doctrine I call transcendental idealism. The realist, in the transcendental signification, makes these modifications of our sensibility into things subsisting in themselves, and hence makes mere representations into things in themselves [Sachen an sich selbst]. (A491/B519)[3]
</p></blockquote><p>Call me naive. Call me an illiterate idiot. Call me a realist. I simply must be practical about philosophy. Somewhere between the ideally-practical (empirical bottom-up reasoning) and ideally-ideal (rationalist top-down reasoning) we find the Bayesian confidence in physics and metaphysics. I'm using ideally here in a way that doesn't suit this conversation, or so it seems. I am, of course, convinced that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> is fundamental to Reason itself.</p><p>Alright, Kant, now I take it to you, homie, /roar. I am now stable enough to start my all-out assault on your vision. You've blinded me with your pocketsand long enough. It's time to begin the process of sublating you. </p><p>I grant you that all of our objects of our direct experience are nothing but appearances which are reducible to electrochemical structures in our computational brains. My mind cannot directly access anything outside of my perceptions. Some of my perception may be entirely internal to my brain, but most of the stimuli is external (and my brain ultimately arises from external processes). Sensations pass through my nerves (perhaps making simple inferences for encoding), my sense organs might in fact be deeply intertwined with multiple locations in my brain. Exactly how I form a representation of the thing-in-itself external to my mind and body is a matter that is mostly solvable in science.</p><p>I can only <em>directly</em> consciously attend to my phenomenology in my mind. The data I'm computing in my software and hardware is all I can directly think, experience, and reason with or about. My perceptions can be inaccurate models of experience, and hence they are things-in-themselves which are fallibly corresponding to (in many case) something external to my mind, brain, and body, what I usually take to be the &quot;thing-in-itself.&quot; It seems to me that Hume denies the causality of this correspondence, but Kant goes a step further and denies the correlation. They are both wildly wrong because they pursue certainty at all costs.</p><p>I'm having a difficult time even understanding what's so transcendental about this, except what you mean to say when you talk about the conditions necessary for experience at all. Unfortunately, the being of meaning is necessary for the external &quot;is&quot; status of external &quot;ought.&quot; </p><hr><p>But, it is the nature of that spark of creativity, of being human, of Dasein's real perceptual power, of knowledge itself, of spiritual experience, that we are pointing to, showing, observing some indirect relationship between, and somehow experiencing a real correspondence between the representation (what we directly access) and the thing-in-itself (what we indirectly access). </p><p>I am almost certain we should never be completely certain when using the highest possible epistemic standards. </p><p>It's clear that Sensen is pushing this direction. The Reason of Humanity itself is all there is to the man. Awesomely moral man that he is, Sensen, and I suppose Kant, is wrong. </p><p>Does this really show that Kant isn't a dogmatic idealist? Look, it's definitely popular to contrast him to Berkeley here. Are we sure he does that? I need to think more carefully about what Kant is claiming he is not.</p><p>He differentiates himself from the &quot;‚Äòempirical idealism‚Äô of Descartes (objects of perception are mere mental ideas, representations).&quot; This is naive or overly religious. Of course, the problem of the external world to the extreme skeptic's epistemic standard will always force us to make room for this possibility. We can never be certain. Certainty isn't a problem though, since I take knowledge to be contextualist and anti-luck. I should also point out that I buy the externalist's claim that, ultimately, justification is external to us. Our knowledge of things &quot;outside&quot; (quotation marks demonstrating the article's meaning here) must actually be justified by something outside our minds. For me, it isn't just the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; but an epistemic grid of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> that even gives analogical light for even the possibility of representation. A.K.A.; I'm a transcendental realist, love.</p></div>
