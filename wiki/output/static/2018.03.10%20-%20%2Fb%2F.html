<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>As always, it's important to not be wrong about what's important in important ways. You're going to be wrong about it, but be wrong for the right reasons, in the right way, at the right time, and so on and so forth.</p><p>I often see that I am raining on other people's parades when I tell the truth, no matter how gently and carefully I do it. It's annoying at the very least to them. But, for the bigger picture parades, more often than not, it is an attack on their very perception of reality, of how they tell themselves the stories of their identities and the world around them. It is an attack on themselves at this level, and that alone is cause to be incredibly defensive. Nobody wants to believe they've been living a lie the entire time.</p><hr><p>I have botted many games, and I can tell you, looking at the whack-a-mole hunt for Russian Trolls, you cannot win in any fashion that doesn't require the user to take a direct hand in filtering and shaping their own experiences (and even then, many will fail). One can always evade detection in this arms race.</p><hr><p>It has been many years since we have argued about the matter. My memory is not perfect, although I believe I have a solid recall of our disagreement. Perhaps we were arguing past each other. It is possible we agreed but did not articulate it well enough.</p><p>As to the nature of faith itself, <em>what and how it is</em> initially, I have seen many accounts. That it is personal, that its root is in our beliefs and identities, I have never disagreed with. My staunch Arminian perspective was a clue to that. How one knows one has faith, however, requires evidence. One does not have faith if one does not act upon it and constitute themselves with it. Essentially, there is a conceptual causal link between Doxa and Praxis that cannot be severed.</p><p>My claim was what faith <em>looked</em> like, how it presented, the practical effects of having had faith, the fruits of the spirit and not merely the gift, the external evidence of faith. Assuming we set aside postmodern problematics, my mind has not changed all that much. I believe that exercising the second of the greatest commandments really is communal: it's fundamentally concerned with empathizing with others.</p><p>Even as a Christian, I took the greatest commandment to give grounds to the second. It was the theoretical duty from which the practical duty emerged. Generating the Kingdom on Earth was in virtue of the second, and the second in virtue of the first. </p></div>
