<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>In this paper, I explore the history and evolution of the concepts of apodicticity and objectivity in Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology. I consider: what Husserl means by and why he is interested in these concepts, and whether or not phenomenology yields apodictic and objective results. In addition, I evaluate the nature and status of logic, particularly with respect to apodicticity and objectivity. </p><p>Husserl‚Äôs philosophical views of the world evolved over time (a good thing, presumably, as this is probably true for any intelligent person). His early work was a stepping stone to his later work, and while we can trace his line of thought, we need not assume that his early work is entirely compatible with his later work. It seems as though objectivity is a concept which evolved over the course of Husserl‚Äôs work, and his early concept may conflict with his later concept. The type of objectivity derived from Husserl‚Äôs Platonism in Logische Untersuchungen seems different from the objectivity derived from his notion of intersubjectivity in Ideen. Not only are these two conceptions of objectivity possibly in conflict, but Husserl‚Äôs later notion of intersubjectivity is unsatisfying as grounds for objectivity. </p><p>Husserl‚Äôs notion of apodicticity may or may not have evolved over his life‚Äôs work. Probably, it did not ‚Äì but the relationships between objectivity and apodicticity in Husserl‚Äôs early work and his later, arguably more phenomenological, work becomes difficult to comprehend. My essential worry is that Husserl‚Äôs late phenomenology fails to meet the criteria of apodicticity (in his initial and our generally agreed understanding of the word). I assume his phenomenology fails to be apodictic, as he originally intended, but it is likely that Husserl knew this himself. Perhaps he used the word apodicticity in his later work with a different meaning, a meaning which wasn‚Äôt going to short-circuit his systematic phenomenology.  Even if we cannot interpret him as doing this, I think a charitable reconstruction of his late work will show that Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology has very high epistemic standards, even if it is not apodictic.</p><p>Essentially, Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology is only functional if he lowers the methodological requirements below his original and supremely high epistemic standards of apodicticity and objectivity. It makes more sense to perform phenomenological research without having to meet Husserl‚Äôs original standards of apodicticity and objectivity. Instead, a healthy amount of doubt and a relatively strong (but not apodictically-based or completely objective) justificatory standard seem both prudent and fruitful in phenomenology. I conclude that charitable interpretations or reconstructions of Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology will relax these original Husserlian standards.</p><p>In <em>Logische Untersuchungen</em>, Husserl considers how knowledge is possible and what conditions must be met in order for one to have knowledge.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> He criticizes psychologism, which argues epistemology is naturalistically ‚Äúconcerned with the cognitive nature of perceiving, believing, judging, and knowing‚Äù and thus claims the status of logic requires empirical investigation and verification.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> This is a large error in Husserl‚Äôs view ‚Äì he thinks logic and mathematics, for example, are not factual, real (in the tangible sense of the word), empirical objects; rather, they are ideal laws or structures. Consequently, our knowledge of them and the manner in which they are known is fundamentally different from how we know empirical, factual claims.  Husserl associates logic and mathematics with a sort of profound certainty, idealism, eternality, and objectivity which are epistemically superior to temporal facts and empirical investigations (which are far more subject to doubt and change). Logic and mathematics are exemplary knowledge of the highest order in Husserl‚Äôs eyes, and it remains separate from psychology and other empirical investigations. It makes sense that Husserl has used logic and mathematics as a subject to tease out foundational claims of epistemology; after all, he was a mathematician. As Stefania Centrone puts it:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>[I]t is well known that Husserl‚Äôs refutation of logical psychologism leads in the Prolegomena to the identification of ‚Äòan internally closed, independent . . . field‚Äô of a priori truths, which constitute the domain of pure logic. Pure logic acknowledges the objectivity of contents of thinking (concepts, propositions, inferences) and studies the properties of and the logical relationships among them. It is a formal, theoretical, a priori science, independent of other sciences, and, in particular, of psychology.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Psychologism fails, in Husserl‚Äôs view, because it attempts to reduce ideal things to real, factual things (like naturalistic objects). The object of knowledge ‚Äì in this case, logic or mathematics, as an ideal object ‚Äì is distinguished from the act of knowing, although the two are connected (they must be if we are to know any logical and mathematical truths).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> Husserl believes that, in order to understand ideality and this connection between the object of knowledge and the act of knowing, we must investigate consciousness; but not as a natural and empirical examination (as psychologism would have us do). This demonstrates his preference for apodicticity and the focus on consciousness within his method of phenomenology. His view on logic also provides us a window into his early views of objectivity. Husserl says:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>No truth is a fact, i.e. something determined as to time. A truth can indeed have as its meaning that something is, that a state exists, that a change is going on etc. The truth itself is, however, raised above time: i.e. it makes no sense to attribute temporal being to it, nor to say that it arises or perishes (Hua 18/87 [109-110]).</p><p>The truth that 2 + 3 = 5 stands all by itself as a pure truth whether there is a world, and this world with these actual things, or not (Hua 9/23).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>It seems as though Husserl is claiming that logic (of which mathematics is a subset) is objectively true, and that it is true independent of a world and perhaps independent of us as conscious beings, as well. He is proffering a sort of Platonism in the Logical Investigations, the epitome of a theory for objectivity, in his early work. This isn‚Äôt the sort of ancient Platonism with perfect forms where objects are poor imitations. Husserl‚Äôs Platonism is still a strong view of objectivity, as truths are mind-independent. Unfortunately, it seems as though he is so vehemently against metaphysics that he can‚Äôt really hold onto this kind of objectivity in his later work. We should be mightily tempted to interpret a kind of realism in this early work, and a kind of idealism in his later work. If there is a shift from realism to idealism in Husserl‚Äôs work (which he wishes to deny in his later works), then, without a doubt, it isn‚Äôt just Husserl‚Äôs conception of objectivity which has evolved.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button>
 
	He starts with the objectivity of Platonism, but eventually fabricates a type of objectivity out of a collective subjectivity: intersubjectivity. What exactly is this intersubjectivity, particularly as it relates to objectivity?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>[I]ntersubjectivity only exists and develops in the mutual interrelationship between subjects that are related to the world; and the world must be conceived as a common and public field of experience (cf. Hua 8/505, 15/373, 13/480, Ms. C 17 33a).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>According to Husserl, my perceptions present me with intersubjectively accessible being, that is, being that does not exist for me alone, but for everybody (Hua 9/431, 14/289, 390, 17/243, 6/469). I experience objects, events, and actions as public, not as private (Hua 1/123, 15/5). Husserl consequently claims that an ontological analysis, insofar as it unveils the being-sense (Seinssinn) of the world as intersubjectively valid, leads to a disclosure of the transcendental relevance of foreign subjectivity and thus to an examination of transcendental intersubjectivity (Hua 15/110).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Concrete, full transcendental subjectivity is the totality of an open community of I‚Äôs‚Äîa totality that comes from within, that is unified purely transcendentally, and that is concrete only in this way. Transcendental intersubjectivity is the absolute and only self-sufficient ontological foundation [Seinsboden], out of which everything objective (the totality of objectively real entities, but also every objective ideal world) draws its sense and its validity (Hua 9/344, transl. modified).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Intersubjectivity is a confirmation, consensus, and a construction of a group of phenomenologists concerning a phenomenon. Objects present themselves intersubjectively. It is because the community of phenomenologists commonly agrees and forms a consensus regarding the nature of an object that the object and our claims about it attain the epistemic status of objectivity. Objectivity in the sense that the world is composed of subjects and objects, the ontological perspective with which Heidegger breaks from Husserl (giving primacy to instrumentality instead), is maintained throughout Husserl‚Äôs body of work. As far as I can see, objectivity in the sense that truth and objects are mind-independent, like the sort found in Husserl‚Äôs initial Platonism, arguably a discussion of realism and idealism, is not clearly maintained throughout Husserl‚Äôs body of work. Phenomenological objectivity may lose the strength of his Platonic objectivity we hope to associate with logic and mathematics, favoring an epistemically weaker intersubjectivity. </p><p>Highly connected to the epistemic standard of objectivity, and probably more essential to Husserl‚Äôs starting place in Phenomenology, is the notion of apodicticity. As far as I can see, objectivity is a necessary pre-condition to apodicticity in his early work, and perhaps an argument which endangers Husserl‚Äôs objectivity will also be dangerous to his apodicticity. Objectivity and apodicticity are strongly connected notions in his early work, but in his later work they seem torn apart, and I am not sure how we can put them back together (or even if we ought to put them back together). </p><p>To know a logical truth seems to be the epitome of having certainty in Husserlian philosophy. It is intuitively obvious and evident that, for example, P = P. The opposite (~P=P) is inconceivable. When we know a logical truth, at least one as foundational and simple as this one, we have no doubt about it. We are certain about it; it is apodictically given to us. This sets the standard, as an example, for what counts as ultimate knowledge in Husserl‚Äôs philosophy.  </p><p>The root of Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology is the pursuit of certainty ‚Äì apodictic knowledge. Adequacy is not enough, he seeks absolute indubitability. An apodictic evidence is not only certain evidence of its objects but is also ‚Äúthe absolute unimaginableness (inconceivability) of their non-being (Hua I, p. 56; 1977, p. 16).‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button> This is a very strong conception of knowledge as fully justified belief. Husserl‚Äôs initial conception of apodicticity does not seem to admit of degrees. You either have apodictic belief or you don‚Äôt. </p><p>We may think of certainty, or apodicticity, as an extreme epistemic property of beliefs. Even if Husserl would agree to a distinction between knowledge and certainty, he would have to argue that certainty is either the singularly highest degree of knowledge or a higher kind of knowledge. </p><p>Phenomenology, as the apodictic science, is, theoretically speaking, an infallible method for achieving certain belief, i.e. knowledge. When we actually go out and perform phenomenological research, we come to realize that our results somehow do not immediately live up to this infallible standard. The process as a practice, the implementation of the method, however, is filled with fallibility. According to Walter Hopp, agent-fallibility should be interpreted from Husserl‚Äôs work. George Heffernan explores even further and argues that we must consider evidence-fallibility.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button> Do these endanger the infallibility of the method? I think a charitable interpretation will claim they do not endanger the infallibility of the phenomenological method. </p><p>These concerns are highly analogous to the epistemic foundations of logic. Logic, as a method, is said to be truth-preserving. The theoretical steps and the method itself can only take you from one truth to another truth. Phenomenology, likewise, preserves apodictic belief. In logic, we use deduction; in phenomenology, we make claims from and analyze consciousness and what is intuitively given and presented to consciousness. Just as in practicing phenomenology, the problem in practicing logic is that an agent can fail to apply it ‚Äì agents are fallible. </p><p>Unfortunately, the analogy weakens when comparing methodological requirements and metatheoretic concerns of verification. Logical deductions use small steps, clearly defined ‚Äì nothing is more precise and spelled-out than logic. The steps are obviously reliable and we are certain of them. Logic is also methodologically simple, in some sense. Logic is a method that is testable by a computer ‚Äì it is that mindless (I use the word with the utmost respect for logic) of an activity. Verification, proofs, and replicability are very straightforward in logic. </p><p>Phenomenology, however, is quite the opposite of being mindless, and it is not straightforward in these respects either. Agent-fallibility does not seem to endanger logic‚Äôs truth preservation, as correcting the errors of agents is a simple task. This sort of correction and verification is not as simple in Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology. It is thus a bit harder for us to see why phenomenology is a science which is as rigorous or as replicable as logic. Phenomenology, as Husserl lays it out, is supposed to lead us to apodictic belief, but the method seems mushy. Husserl distinguishes the analogy:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Phenomenology in acts of seeing, determining, and distinguishing sense. It compares, it distinguishes, it connects, it places in relation, it divides into parts, it separates off moments. But it does all this in the act of pure seeing. It does not engage in theory or mathematical construction; that is, it offers no explanations in the sense of deductive theories. (Hua II, p. 58; 1999, p. 43)<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The analogy breaks in domains as well. Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology has a larger epistemic domain than logic, being concerned not only with truth, but also with belief. Apodicticity is much larger in scope and stronger in its epistemic claim than the truth-preservation of logic, and perhaps this should afford it more charity than we might initially think is merited. </p><p>Phenomenology, as a method, in some sense cannot be separated from agents, the steps are not as clear as they are for logic, and the verification is based on intersubjectivity. The method seems flawed because it exists and functions in virtue of agents, which is not obviously the case for logic. It seems that agent-fallibility is more problematic for Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology than it is for logic. </p><p>Apodicticity seems to be gained by the initial phenomenological reduction, but from within this perspective not all transcendental claims appear to be apodictic. While perhaps not apodictic, these claims still seem to have a powerful epistemic status as they are claimed from within the phenomenological reduction. I think it is akin to building a house on epistemically more stable and less doubtable ground. The house itself might not be apodictic, but the grounds are apodictic. A structure built on such a stable foundation seems far less vulnerable to epistemic criticisms than structures not built upon such ground. Assuming all else being equal (neither house lives up to the standard of apodicticity), we should prefer the house built upon apodictic grounds. </p><p>In Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology, objectivity is supposed to come from intersubjectivity. This does not necessarily make the method fallible, but it makes it much harder to see why it is infallible. Why should we believe that intersubjectivity amounts to objectivity? I do not know. A group of phenomenologists may be less fallible than an individual phenomenologist, but I see no reason to think together they are inevitably infallible or objective. </p><p>Insofar as the method can be separated from the agents, we do not need to be worried about method fallibility, but I do not really understand what it means to separate this method its practitioners. Perhaps in the most theoretical sense, phenomenology may be infallible, but in practice it does not appear infallible ‚Äì it may never, practically speaking, lead us exclusively to apodictic beliefs. Husserl appears to have known this himself, and maybe it did not bother him. My worry is that apodicticity is disconnecting from objectivity and losing its primacy as an epistemic foundation, in some sense, after performing the phenomenological reduction, but perhaps this is just fine. </p><p>Part of the difficulty in fleshing out the differences between the notions of objectivity and apodicticity found in the early and later work of Husserl rests upon the fact that the scope of the Logical Investigations is smaller and plainly different from Ideas. Within the domain of the Logical Investigations, apodicticity and objectivity seem to be one and the same, having realist notions. What develops in Husserl is the thought that something like this can extend outside of this domain. It is a seed to Ideas, but Husserl‚Äôs later development of phenomenology grows into something quite different and arguably idealist. </p><p>It is possible that the Logical Investigations is conducted within the natural attitude. Husserl probably did not really have the phenomenological reduction at that point in time. Once you make the move to idealism, and objectivity is constituted differently, then what does apodicticity mean and to what does it now apply? Where is apodicticity preserved in Husserl? It is preserved in the phenomenological reduction, the immanent presentation is taken to be apodictic, but the objectivities determined out of that are not necessarily apodictic. Within Ideas, a distinction is drawn between the immanent presentations and so-called transcendent objects, which are always dubious. Apodicticity is allocated to certain aspects of Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology, but not everything must meet that standard. Note that the ‚Äúcould always be wrong‚Äù is built into the notion of a transcendent object ‚Äì we could always be wrong about the next perspective. There might be some sort of objectivity constituted about these objects, but it is a dubitable objectivity. Objectivity and apodicticity seem to go hand-in-hand within the Logical Investigations, but they seem to break apart in Husserl‚Äôs later work. </p><p>Upon reflection, we should see that Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology is easy to salvage or perhaps is misinterpreted. Husserl himself lowered his expectations concerning objectivity, and if we lower the standard for phenomenology below apodicticity (and we can still maintain a very, very high epistemic standard even without the absolute certainty of apodicticity), then his phenomenology appears to have better form and function. </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Zahavi, Dan.¬†<em>Husserl's Phenomenology</em>.
