<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Surely I must be an ignorant fool! Neil Gaiman is highly respected. I've enjoyed some of his stories immensely. He can Alice in Wonderland you hard. This book was pure rhetoric. Go ahead and say I'm overcomplicating it, missing the point, reading too much into this, tonepolicing, being too literal, abrasively being too serious, or failing to be fittingly charitable in my interpretation. You dun fucked up, Gaiman. This isn't the amazing author I thought I knew. </p><p>Instructions are prescriptive (even if only as hypothetical imperatives). This is a book on <em>ethics</em>, and it's a condescending, arrogant, preachy pile of shit (you know: like me). Gaiman got too big for his britches in this tiny book. I'm all for being as reductive as reasonably possible for the occasion, but I'm not sure how one can write a reasonable book on ethics in a handful of illustrated pages. Give me all the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Diamonds.html">Diamonds</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Redpills.html">Redpills</a>; this ain't one of 'em.</p><p>Unless you are performing a miracle, successful writing should either make ONE illustrated short tale say something very particular in practical ethics through casuistry (e.g. an Aesop's Fable) or you're going to speak in first principle pure generalizations (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> is almost mentioned for a single page). This book does neither. This book attempted to be flowery, poetic, and act like it said something irreducibly valuable to say. It's sugarspeak hogwash.</p><p>This book is largely designed to tell you to live your life however you see fit. Welcome to metaethical perfectionism, where your moral relativism  and confabulatory justifications get called out. Your moral right to selfish individualism ends where our communal moral rights to your sacrificial execution of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> begins. No: you don't own yourself! </p><p>Look, here's an instruction for you, Gaiman: find the magic in life, but make sure it's real! This celebration of the experience machine qua hedonia is immoral! Wake up. I have a fuckton of time spent in fantasy, but I'm not going stand by and watch someone fail to respect reality or even the purpose of prescriptive storytelling itself. As always: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ridtyawtr.html">ridtyawtr</a>.</p><p>Oh yes, I'm raining in on the parade here. I'm just being a negative asshole who can't be satisfied. Let others have their fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a time and place for it: ethics is serious fucking business though. I don't play in this domain; we don't have time. Go make your fantasy, but at never actually at the expense of reality in the end. Augment, enrich, and awaken reality through fiction. Make reality brighter with your stories. Building real things, especially good and right ones, requires profound imagination.</p></div>
