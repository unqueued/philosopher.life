<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I'm leaning more heavily towards the local union at this point. That said, I talked to Keaton. He's willing to be roommates, assuming that's the direction we're both heading. I guess next week Tuesday would be the last day. I'll need to call up the sociopath to make sure everything is set as well.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button></p><p>I called the Louisville fitters union. They aren't taking applications until September, and they won't actually begin the program until August of next year. It would technically be possible for me to hit Journeyman with a year or two of that. The pay is about the same adjusted for the cost of living. I'll apply when I can. It wouldn't hurt.</p><p>Anyways, getting up was harder than usual this morning, but once I stepped back into the shop, I felt right at home. I'm very glad I got to go today. In fact, I was straight up giddy to get my hands dirty again. </p><p>The teacher asked us to make sure the pieces we've made are as safe for handling as possible. Apparently, he really is going to use them again for some demonstration/fair thing. I thought it was just for the union visitors.</p><p>We finished the Y in no time, then we moved onto studying for our usual Monday test. We're crushing it. Chris was borderline confrontational/accusatory with the teacher about being held back at Nash's pace (that was not my doing...Chris clearly has seen what I've seen though). Nash didn't show up today.</p><p>We took the test. I assume we passed. I've yet to not do well on a test.</p><p>We then started working on saddles. My teacher did an exceptionally poor job teaching us this time, but with enough questions, we were able to extract the necessary information out of him (in addition to figuring some of it out on our own). The initial work was done within half an hour. But, it wasn't up to snuff. We worked on it for quite a while. Unfortunately, there is still the tiniest sliver of light coming through. The teacher expected it to be a perfect seal, apparently (which doesn't make perfect sense to me because this is supposed to be welded anyways). At the end of the day, I quietly asked the upperclassmen to look at it. Several said it was the best saddle they've ever seen and that it obviously should pass (their work was passed with far lower standards). I find it odd that it isn't passing yet. That's okay. I'll keep working on it. Practice makes perfect. I realize this will get harder, and I might as well understand and practice as much as I can.</p><p>Chris was annoyed by a remark the teacher made, a &quot;nono&quot; we committed that we weren't told about. We beveled inside to make it fit even closer (although, it obviously weakens the walls, and I should have known better), just like the example he handed us. The teacher clearly should have said something about it on the example he gave us if he didn't want us to do the same. That's okay. It wasn't too complicated to fix. </p><p>The teacher really doesn't spend time teaching. But, in a very weird way, I kinda' like it. I enjoy having to figure it out to some extent. I'm forced to make my own deductions, which I enjoy doing (at least when there is no pressure). I like being held in check on whether or not I actually know something, to know the boundaries and limits of where my knowledge and reason can take me, and most importantly, to know when it is time to ask for help. This is key. </p><p>Also, I need to call/text AB&amp;T for more forms. </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> I had a conversation with my father on his birthday about it. I never know what to say my dad anymore (and he would tell you the same thing from his direction as well). I couldn't articulate why I thought the man was a sociopath to my father (although, my father clearly has that switch inside him as well; he just uses it more wisely than most sociopaths). The training coordinator is an ex-football player, evangelical Christian, who studies psychological tricks to manipulate people (he's sadly proud of it; definitely dark triadic), demonstrates that clearly in his communications with me, his secretary, and his board members, is slick as fuck (knows how to make himself likable, despite lacking empathy), and is apparently famous for a lack of impulse control. He has no problem lying. The markers and signs are there. I'm tellin' ya, the guy gives me the heebie-jeebies.</sub></p></div>
