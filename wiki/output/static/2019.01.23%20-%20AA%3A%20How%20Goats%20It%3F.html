WED 11:08 AM
My goats is tryin to stay awake ‚Äîstruggling
WED 11:09 AM
:goat::sleeping:
WED 11:09 AM
I may have to resort to the caffeine hunt!!!
WED 11:10 AM
Lol.
WED 11:10 AM
I may join you.
WED 11:11 AM
But! It is a 3 day week so I can do this!
WED 11:11 AM
Heck yeah.
WED 11:11 AM
How‚Äôs the fam? Every one ok?
WED 11:12 AM
Still struggling to get my children to care enough about themselves to do their best (slowly losing my mind over it), but yeah...they are doing well.
WED 11:12 AM
[[1uxb0x]] charged the car battery yesterday.
WED 11:12 AM
[[j3d1h]] has a boyfriend.
WED 11:12 AM
I'm writing a letter to him over the wiki. He's an RPer.
WED 11:13 AM
Oh my.... that second one is a hard one
WED 11:14 AM
I'm new to this.
WED 11:14 AM
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do other than be kind, rofl.
WED 11:14 AM
What do you do?
WED 11:15 AM
[[UJ]] always jokes about playing ‚Äúmy bat, your head‚Äù with any of the guys that have shown interest in the girls
WED 11:15 AM
How about you? What's running through your head?
WED 11:16 AM
That‚Äôs hard ‚ÄîI was always a fan of the ones that were respectful and treated my girls well. But mostly it was [[K]] and he has always been great
WED 11:16 AM
Aye. [[K]]'s a keeper.
WED 11:16 AM
I'm looking for keepers I guess.
WED 11:17 AM
Or helping my daughter spot what it means to be a keeper.
WED 11:17 AM
I feel very blessed to have him as part of the family
WED 11:17 AM
I feel like your relationship with her will help guide her that and some open talks about what is good and what is not
WED 11:18 AM
This is my current joke: &quot;I will be thinking about whether or not you will be a responsible owner of my current daughter-property.&quot;
WED 11:20 AM
lol
WED 11:20 AM
We are just now looking at boys interested in [[AG]] ‚Äîthe only one really is the little guy she has been friends with since kindergarten
WED 11:20 AM
He is a math genius..took calculus in 6th grade
WED 11:21 AM
But socially awkward :upside_down_face:
WED 11:22 AM
That‚Äôs good!
WED 11:39 AM
That would be nifty.
WED 11:41 AM
Both you girls would have guys who they went to school with.
WED 11:43 AM
I'm hoping if and when my kids can go to college they'll find a mate there.
WED 11:43 AM
Yeah Nathaniel is actually at the Gatton Academy doing 11th grade even though his bday is just a few days after [[AG]]‚Äôs
WED 11:45 AM
Neat.
WED 11:46 AM
They stay in contact remotely, I take it?&gt;
WED 11:46 AM
Yes ‚Äî[[AG]] is not great at keeping up with her phone
WED 11:47 AM
I can appreciate that. I have a love/hate relationship with mine as well. Need to find me uh Mount Doom with a lava pit to toss it into.
WED 11:48 AM
Yep yep
