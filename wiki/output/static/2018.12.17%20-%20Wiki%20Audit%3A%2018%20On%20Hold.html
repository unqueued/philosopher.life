<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>So, 5.1.18 has been a clusterfuck. They have no official testing, and I can tell. A sufficient number of problems have arisen such that 5.1.19 must be immediately released. Imho, they need to set aside the core functions and build a test suite. I don't know enough about the wiki to do that. Interestingly, I think a test-wiki is exactly what would allow newcomers (and slowpokes like me) to actually understand the internals of the wiki. The documentation is a mess, and testing may be a way to stabilize that.</p><p>Give me documentation like i3, python, or arch, and I can at least look like I know what I'm doing enough to build what I want. Maybe this is my fault still though.</p><p>I'm going to wait. <code>/sadsniff</code> I will wait for you KeeBoord, Kin, link autocompletion, and loading screen!</p><hr><p>I am not convinced I will be able to improve my handle on (or mitigation of) the race condition gremlins in Bob. Part of the issue is that I edit too quickly. I've noticed that if I wait a minute, the locks drop. The fact is that I really want to pop in, edit, pop-out/save in seconds in many cases. The lag is annoying.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>' firmcoding is the {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="focus.html">focus</a>}. Once we have a firmcoding process in place, I will have no excuse not to revamp every directory for it. From there, we move onto <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Search%2520of%2520h0p3.html">Search of h0p3</a> to supercharge her firmcoding and button workstation (among other things).</p><p>Also, her update is now to 2.1 on the plugin! =)</p><hr><p>Tiddlytool has to be reset PER tab in Bob. Ugh. I can see why he abandoned it.</p><hr><p>Can we build a testing suite that doesn't take up too much space? Perhaps this is a tool that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h.html">j3d1h</a> and I need to build. It WOULD teach us about TW in a radical way. That might not be a terrible idea. Meh. This seems like the wrong thing somehow. What I would like more than testing TW across the board is really a benchmarking tool. If not that, unique snippets, idiomatic expressions, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="diamondic.html">diamondic</a> approaches to problems should be captured. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="TW%253A%2520Cheatsheet.html">TW: Cheatsheet</a> is a very minimal start, I suppose.</p><p>It is interesting to see that Jermolene really does mean for this project to only last for 20 years (eh, I might not be around anyway, but perhaps...I don't know how long it will take me to write this...part of me hopes and thinks it will be a lifetime [and part obviously doesn't]). He has already mentioned <em>TWX</em> and how he would build the next generation different from TW5. Considering the HUGE fucking gap between TWC and TW5, I am worried about being too specific in the tooling. Many of the tools built for TWC simply do not port over to TW5. This is a very strong case for trying to be vanilla in everything.</p><p>Will there be a TWX? Again, static content is the key. I can refactor quite a bit. Building as statically as I can will go a long way.</p><hr><p>I have made it through 2017.10. Can I finish? 2 months to go in 2 weeks!</p><hr><p>Hey, you know you need, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a>? You need another <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Core%2520Daily%2520Requirement.html">Core Daily Requirement</a>!! ROFLMAOWTFPWNBBQSAWCE!!!!
