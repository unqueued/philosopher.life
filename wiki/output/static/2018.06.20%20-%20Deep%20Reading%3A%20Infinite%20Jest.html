<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Orin is a piece of shit, and it's weird to see Hal highlight that so clearly.</p><p>The bricklayer's tale is random. I just don't see the point of it except what randomness in general has to tell us about the nature of telling stories to ourselves.</p><p>The heart/purse mugging is surreal, lol.</p><p>The anti-ONAN list reminds me of my wiki hardcore. I'd like to think, perhaps arrogantly, that I've spent a great deal more time attempting to organize and mindmap. DFW's book isn't meant to be an upload of a mind, but more of a mile-high view of many lives. I'm growing to think DFW would find what I'm doing interesting (assuming he were open to even looking at it).</p><p>The discussion of the information age revolution based on the Internet in the book is a prescient parody. The &quot;fugue&quot; of attention-divided aural illusion is on the money. DFW nailed the phenomenology of the communication.</p><p>The videophonical side of this story is interesting as a prediction.</p><p>I'm feeling that urine sample anxiety. Lol.</p><p>Pemulis' anti-entrapment method of forcing his buyers to claim over the phone that they will pay for him to commit a crime (or will hurt him if he doesn't) is interesting and funny.</p><p>James Incandenza's father's discussion with his son is profound. You hear the perfectionism in it. Jesus. I can hear myself in this character too. I feel broken like many of these characters. This may be one of the most important scenes in the book. This is a serious existential moment, and a difficult one for both of them. It is clearly influential to their lives.</p><p>Pemulis is beautifully paranoic.</p><p>I don't know DMZ as a substance, but names come and go.</p><p>Hal's narration is hilarious, but then I've decided its absurdity is actually really sad. I hope to laugh again about it.</p><p>Game is about managed fear. That sounds like he's talking about life, not just tennis. =) The game of life, of course, at least part of what Tennis is all about in this book.</p><p>Patricia Montesian's scene is rough.</p><p>Madame Psychosis, not the drug...what does this mean?</p><p>I don't understand the entire Madame Psychosis set of narratives/symbols/motifs/whatever. Psychosis, that fits this book. The details I do not understand. As I've said, I'm not qualified to read this book.</p><p>I take DFW to be a rabbitholing researcher.</p><p>DFW has a great deal to say about dependency, drugs, addiction, and essentially, our motivations and what it means. He's worried about freewill super fucking hard.</p></div>
