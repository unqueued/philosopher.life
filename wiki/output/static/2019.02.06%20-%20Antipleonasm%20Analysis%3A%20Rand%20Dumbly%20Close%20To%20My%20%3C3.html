The Neo-Kantians will not like my defense, and in fact, they are part of the cause of the problem in this case. Come, Saint Aristotle, let us defeat the beast with our modern day heresy!</p><p>We are at the fundamental problem in philosophy. This is the fucking vortex of all deserts, and we can only ever speculate. It is the Bobbiest of all Bob turtles of Turtles all the way down. It is Plato's Allegory. This is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Fideism.html">Fideism</a> in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Dialetheia.html">The Dialetheia</a>. Obviously, we can never be certain, and we are forced into transcendental inferences. One must be bold. Begrudgingly: I respect <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Ayn%2520Rand.html">Ayn Rand</a>'s huge ovaries and lip service to what matters most. She at least says the words even if she never really means or understands them (likely for the veneer of respectability).</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Telos.html">The Telos</a> is the beginning and the end of all things, both epistemically and ontologically. It is the <em>for the sake of which</em> of everything, including <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Itself.html">Itself</a>. Insofar as one can possibly peel apart the logical equivalences of unified necessity, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> is necessary for even the possibility of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a>. Contingency and agency are built on necessary building blocks, and the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SO.html">SO</a> normativity which emerges from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="FO.html">FO</a> normativity to generate another set of objects or processes we also call ends, traditionally.</p><p>Insofar as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520End.html">The End</a> of all things, and insofar as we are not <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> subjective objects rather than <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Infinite.html">The Infinite</a> objective object, we cannot be called <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="end.html">end</a>s in ourselves. This is the grand dialectical problem of categorical contextualism and particularism. Somehow, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a>, and hence <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, of all possibilities is wrapped and defined by the universal context of all contexts. </p><p>To deny the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SO.html">SO</a> move, to deny <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> exists, to say there is no objective truth to what we ought to do, results in the modal collapse of everything into <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> itself. So many Saints have held this point of view. There is something quite <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="beautiful.html">beautiful</a> about it. On such a view, this just is the best of all possible worlds because it is the only one. I think taking that belief can generate a kind of serene quietism which relegates us to mere phenomenological observers. I see no reason to think this is mere fate; it appears to also imply determinism and even a unified metaphysical identity (of which our observation is but a hallucinatory Spinozan mode). There's no point in talking about anything but The One (or whatever you say just is whatever would be said without qualification).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button> Whatever happens just is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="good.html">good</a> without qualification, and the appearance of evil is necessary to our phenomenology but ultimately is also good (we're hallucinating). I do see the appeal, but I will not trick myself if I can help it (even though I can never be certain). </p><p>Is there something to talk about? Does any evil exist at all? Is there something which could possibly have been better? Can we possibly do otherwise? Is it up to us at all? Are we pseudo-unmoved-movers in some possible <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, category, etc.? I see no other way to talk about freedom. Our autonomy seems to be the source of dignity which differentiates us from the stagnant, almost neutral, non-agential moral medium in which we legislate our identities. Ah, and it is here that we appear to be ends in ourselves. It is in the realm of possibility, namely in our particular possible world, that we become ends. I believe <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> of our agency is particularized to our possible world. Perhaps there are different degrees of freedoms among the possible worlds. I simply don't know.</p><p>Thus, my claim is that I am a contingent end in myself, but I am not a necessary one.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">n</sup></button> Only <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> can be that, and even the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> is fundamentally integrated into that necessary marble slab which only reveals the beautiful sculpture within to our context. I am not an end in all possible worlds, only <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> can be that by definition. Thus, I agree &quot;every man is an end in himself&quot; in his possible world. All possible worlds are instrumentally pointing to, generated by, constituted by, and constitutive of, to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, necessity. This is why I say we are ends one-step removed from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520End.html">The End</a>. We are instruments of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, but powerful in that we can choose not to be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="good.html">good</a> instruments of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> (or more precisely, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a>). </p><p>Of course, Rand doesn't hold this point of view at all. This is irrelevant to her. She doesn't actually give a shit. She just wants to proclaim she's an end in herself, so you aren't allowed to hold her accountable to anything. You have no right, she has no obligation. She is not talking about owning each other collectively; she's talking about people owning each other individually (literal slavery).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">e</sup></button> Ironically, her approach to individualism is just to claim she's the only individual that matters while being realpolitik to pat you on the back enough to facetiously say you're cool too.</p><p>No, she doesn't need metaphysics, metaethics, or epistemology. Philosophy isn't therapeutic for her either. For her, philosophy is just a rhetorical device and weapon to deceptively acquire power for the sake of power. The only <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="good.html">good</a> she cares about is her own. She denies there is any objective <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Good.html">Good</a> outside her own subjective perspective. It is hilarious that they call themselves objectivists, though they clearly objectify others as mere means rather than ends while gaslitically doubletalk-claiming the opposite.</p><p>You can tell she has no idea what Kant is really saying. She doesn't say <em>mere</em> means here. Obviously, when I ask you to hold my coat for me so I can tie my shoes, I'm using you as means, but not as <em>mere</em> means. That's not a small mistake to make at this level. She only appears to quote scripture. Beware the pharisees seeking to become pharaoh.</p><p>Her contradictory Bob turtles are conveniently higher than they need be. Her claims are obviously inconsistent without necessity. I expect philosophers to take up <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Dialetheia.html">The Dialetheia</a> only out of absolute necessity (ROFL!). That's not what's happening here; she hides it well. She doesn't get to help herself to Reason; there is no <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Right.html">Right</a> by her definition above. Thus, she must deny we are ends in ourselves.</p><p>Defining eudaimonia is a non-trivial challenge. It's obvious that she means hedonia here.</p><p>Finally, even mutually disinterested rational personal-utility-maximizing agents behind the veil would select <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. She has no interest in Gygian justice; with that Ring, she would enslave everyone. Furthermore, if your moral law relativizes exclusively to whether or not it hedonically satisfies you, you aren't talking about morality: you're talking about the egoist's pursuit in the state of nature.
 </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">d : </span> I see this strongly in Daoism. I can show it in versions of Calvinism. It shows up in many philosophical perspectives. I suggest it is a form of learned helplessness at best, and more generally, a form of confabulation and rationalizing our way to lacking accountability whenever it is convenient. Indeed, compatibilists raise the flag of surrender without consistency. No, freedom really is as radical as the incompatibilists imply. But, I digress.
