<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><strong>[1a]</strong></p><p>Hursthouse incorrectly claims that the proverbial ‘lesser of two evils’, assuming those are the only possible choices which need be considered, is actually evil in some way [Criticism #1]. The preliminary mistake which leads to this false conclusion is her severance of ‘moral decision’ and ‘moral action’ [Criticism #2]. The connective argument is that if a moral decision does not entail a moral act, then it is possible to morally choose the ‘lesser of the two evils’, but consider the corresponding act to be morally wrong. I think she argues for both the claims I am criticizing through the course of several examples and arguments, each with their own fallacies. </p><p>She initiates these claims by pointing out the (supposed) possibility of the options in a resolvable dilemma as not necessarily being absolutely morally right or morally wrong with respect to the other option. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The writers (frequently unconsciously) take the dilemma to be ‘either x is the morally right act to do here (without qualification) and y is the one that’s morally wrong or y is the morally right act (without qualification), etc.’ They simply overlook the third possibility of, for example, ‘Well, they are both pretty awful, but (supposing the dilemma is resolvable) x isn’t quite as a bad as y’.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button>  
</p></blockquote><p>Here she begins to carefully sever ‘decision’ from ‘act’, as x and y are spoken of as actions but not decisions. She goes on to suggest that both x and y are “awful,” as if we should understand both of them to be evil and immoral acts. In the case of this resolvable dilemma, which can be understood to mean there is a morally correct decision, x-act is somehow less morally wrong than y-act, and in contrast to the position she opposes, she is implying that x-act is not necessarily ‘right’ despite it being the best of the acts available. Crucially, she explains: </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Suppose [a morally right act] does not come off, well, that is a pity, but still, we say, [the virtuous agents] made the ‘morally right decision’, the ‘right moral decision’; good for them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Here she claims that the intention/decision is good (we can all agree to that), the act, however, has failed. We must ask: what is the moral status of the failed action? If the action succeeded, Hursthouse has no problem calling it ‘morally right action’, but Hursthouse is not inclined to praise the ‘failed’ action. I suspect that Hursthouse is implying that with the same intentions, the ‘failed action’ is less morally right than (or morally wrong compared to) the ‘successful action’. I see this as one of three ways in which she attempts to sever to the decision from the act and show how the moral status of the decision does not demonstrate the moral status of the action.</p><p>My problem with claiming ‘the decision was right while the act may not have been to the same degree’ boils down to how I see moral decision and moral action as being two sides of the same coin for which the agent is responsible. In the above case, why and how the act ‘did not come off’ seems to me an important issue. I believe that Hursthouse must argue that the reason the act didn’t come off wasn’t for any lacking of intention to perform at the highest quality/effort on the part of the virtuous agent. If she didn’t claim this, then we could argue that the agent isn’t truly virtuous because that agent had intended to put forth less than the proper effort. So, we must assume that in this case, the virtuous agent chose to perform the act with the correct amount of effort, but the circumstances were such that the act, unfortunately, didn’t succeed. Here she would correctly claim the decision is morally right.  I disagree, however, with the idea that the morally right decision doesn’t automatically entail the morally right act. I think there is ‘successful morally right action’ and ‘failed morally right action’, but Hursthouse does not seem to agree.</p><p>Hursthouse does not flesh out what it means for an action to ‘fail’, but she should, because understanding our psychology is vital to the virtue ethicist. I think there is much to be said about the potential of an action and what actually occurs, particularly as it is involved in how we understand an agent’s responsibility to intention and action. While Hursthouse did not explicitly state it, we must argue that the virtuous person was wise enough to have considered the probability of an action succeeding, and yet still chose the option, despite the possibility of failing.</p><p>Perhaps I am not a skilled baker, and I have a very high chance to fail a baking assignment. Perhaps virtue ethics may require that I make my best attempt at baking a cake in some instance, even though I know I am unlikely to succeed in actually arriving at a delicious cake. If I were virtuous (obviously hypothetical), I would virtuously attempt to bake a cake with my low-baking skill, putting forth every bit of effort required, and while the actual resulting cake will likely be a failure, I still performed the virtuous action of attempting to bake a cake as best I could. We can see the difference between excellence of a practice and moral virtue in this example. I can fail because I lack excellence in the practice of baking, but I would not fail in doing what was right, namely attempting to bake as best as I could. Differently, imagine my brother, a skilled chef, was put in the same circumstance and also happened to be virtuous (again, obviously hypothetical). Perhaps he would succeed in baking a cake where I failed; however, his action isn’t morally better than mine. It is only incidental that his high-baking skill (contrasted to my awful skill) will modify the circumstances such that his morally right action of attempting to bake a cake will succeed where my morally right action inevitably failed. Now, it is also possible that even a skilled chef may fail to bake a cake not of any fault of their own either, but simply because circumstances outside the chef’s control (e.g. the gas/electricity unexpectedly went off) dictated that the resulting cake would fail. Even here the attempt is what has moral worth, not the incidental success or failure of that attempt.</p><p>As evident from Hursthouse’s example, perhaps there is a failure rate for at least some of the actions available to an agent; appropriate judgment seems to require that the agent weighs the probabilities of outcomes to each decision in order to understand which is most virtuous. If we can’t hold that the virtuous agent was required to weigh the probabilistic consequences of decisions, then the agent doesn’t seem to really have a meaningful and morally culpable causal link between his intention and the corresponding consequences in those circumstances which do not have guaranteed outcomes. </p><p>If an agent is faced with absolutely known outcomes for decisions, then there is a strong sense of moral responsibility derived from the causal link from the intention to its resulting consequences. If, however, a virtuous agent finds herself in a probabilistic scenario; and if moral wisdom doesn’t include knowledge of the success/failure rates of actions; and the agent therefore is not held responsible for learning, knowing, and consulting these probability calculations - then the agent can’t be responsible for even making proper decisions in these cases, as the decisions have no meaningful connection to possible results for the agent. </p><p>Surely we cannot hold people responsible for choosing that which they aren’t responsible for comprehending or considering in the first place. Thus, I think we must say that the virtuous agent is morally responsible to (and, in virtue of being virtuous, does in fact) possess some degree of knowledge about the failure/success rates of possible future actions. If the agent is held responsible for this knowledge, then we can show moral culpability to the sorts of actions (attempted actions) which have probabilistic outcomes (i.e. those which an agent can ‘fail’).</p><p>Hursthouse must claim the virtuous agent understood the probability of consequences which would result from making the morally right decision. Oddly, it seems as if she holds the agent fully responsible for all the consequences of a decision in probabilistic circumstances with failure/success rates. But why should we think the consequences of probabilistic circumstances which result from this decision and attempted action are things for which the agent can be morally responsible? I believe they simply aren’t. I agree that the agent is responsible for the probability calculation, the decision, and the attempted action which is filled with potential to either succeed or fail, but not the resulting probabilistic success or failure of the action itself. </p><p>I do not see how we can hold the virtuous agent (who had chosen wisely and acted as virtuously as possible) somehow responsible for these consequence of the act failing. If a virtuous act fails, I blame the probabilistic circumstance - not the virtuous agent who had chosen and acted as well as possible. To require the virtuous agent to succeed in the act which inevitably failed due to no fault of the agent is tantamount to requiring the impossible. Hursthouse has artificially inflated an agent’s moral responsibility to include those things over which their will has no power. We cannot hold persons responsible for that which is outside their control, which includes circumstances which have the final say in whether or not an action will fail or succeed. Insofar as an action is within an agent’s control and power, she is responsible for it; but insofar as the circumstances have control and power over the success and failure of the action, the agent is not responsible, and, therefore, we cannot assess it as right or wrong on the part of the agent. </p><p>In probabilistic scenarios, I separate the actual results (circumstantial) from the potential-filled attempted action (within the agent’s realm of moral responsibility); and while I think Hursthouse must do that, I don’t think she has. I think Hursthouse has conflated the actual resulting consequences of a probabilistic circumstance with the causing action, which merely contains potential consequences. The former we cannot be responsible for; the latter we must be responsible for. Here you can see how Hursthouse incorrectly extends an agent’s moral responsibility to include something over which he has no power. It would make sense here for her to claim that a virtuous person could make a morally correct decision, while holding that the ‘failed’ action may not have been morally correct in the same way as the ‘successful’ action. If I held her position, I would also attempt to separate decision and action. As I believe we should only be interested in the probability of failure/success rates of actions insofar as they are required in making proper moral decisions and I do not conflate the actual consequences of probabilistic circumstances with my potential-filled actions, however, I see no separation between decision and action such that one can be morally right and the other be wrong.</p><p>Hursthouse goes on to describe the case of a man who has previously created an awful resolvable circumstance whereby he must choose to break his promise to one of two women and marry the other.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button>  Hursthouse claims that even if the man “makes, ‘the morally right decision’….He merits not praise, but blame, for having created the circumstances.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> Notice how Hursthouse seems to punish the man twice for his historical wrongdoing. Here Hursthouse doesn’t directly employ the ‘failed’ action fallacy, but instead a different one which she thinks allows her to separate decision from action such that the moral status of one is not conferred to the other. Crucial to this sub-argument is Hursthouse’s temporal scope; she sums the initial choices to promise marriage to both women together with the current resolvable dilemma. </p><p>Hursthouse runs the risk of conflating the moral status of historical choices with the moral status of future choices in terms of being one single unit of moral experience with a single moral status. I think it is vital to assess moral experience within the smallest possible units of moral judgment. If we are forced to use a broad temporal scope and provide assessment on a range of choices over time as a single unit of moral experience then we fail to exhibit how any particular choice in that range is a morally relevant choice in itself. This doesn’t mean that previous moral obligations have no impact on future moral obligations; rather, each instance of choice should be assessed on its own. The only exception would be the appearance of simultaneous choices which entail each other, such as the case where the man is fulfilling his promise to one woman and simultaneously reneging his promise to another; as both of these entail each other by the very meanings of ‘promise’ and ‘marriage’, this instance can be construed as a single unit of moral experience or judgment.</p><p>It is possible that Hursthouse is tempted to claim the decision to renege is morally wrong in itself and that the simultaneous choice to renege and fulfill promises to two different women is wrong. And, if the man were considering reneging both promises, I would agree, but he is clearly looking to do what is right here, even if, as a consequence of choosing what is right, he ends up hurting another woman. There is a logically entailed relationship between these promises and the monogamous nature of marriage, as the two marital promises are mutually exclusive in both the choices available in the resolvable dilemma, so no matter which fulfillment option is taken, to fulfill one promise is to renege the other by logical consequence (if the man could break laws of logic, he would!). Virtue ethics is already equipped to answer this sort of question though - the Thomistic principle of double effect handily addresses this (and I’m somewhat inclined to agree with it). </p><p>Hursthouse already claims that the decision to fulfill one promise is morally right (although the action is not considered morally right). So despite any temptation one might have to label the decision to renege as wrong, if the man is intending to fulfill a promise and merely as a the logical consequence of fulfilling a promise happens to renege on a promise to another woman, he can still be said to be making the morally correct decision. If one does not employ the principle of double effect, I’m not sure it would be reasonable to claim that the man is making a morally right decision (as Hursthouse claims he does). So, as I am almost certain she is employing some variant of the principle of double effect, we need not worry that she would claim that the man is simultaneously making the morally right decision and also the morally wrong decision; clearly Hursthouse believes the man is strictly making the morally right decision. </p><p>I believe Hursthouse has conflated some number of independent units of moral experience into a single large one. In this example, the man’s choice to make multiple marital promises should be assessed independently of his future choice to fulfill one of these promises. My guess is that she has mistakenly carried the assessment of the man’s previous choice to promise both women (particularly the morally wrong one) over to his future choice, automatically deeming the entire set as wrong when (in reality) not all the choice-members of that (falsely conflated) set were actually wrong. </p><p>I will agree to the fact that the man did something morally wrong when he made his promise to the second woman, but I cannot agree he is doing something wrong when he correctly fulfills one promise and logically reneges his other with these women. Hursthouse seems to think that she can separate moral choice from moral action in this instance because of how she employs a varying temporal scope. With a narrow temporal scope she points out that the man has made a morally right decision in fulfilling his promise, but then widens her scope to include the previous morally wrong decision of promising the second woman in order to say that the action in the resolvable dilemma, which is derived from the morally right choice, is somehow morally wrong because of a past moral error. This is a mistake – she must employ the same temporal scope in assessing the decision and the action. If she properly employed the temporal scope to validly explicate the moral units of experience in her example, she would see that morally correct decision does in fact cause a morally correct act. The morally wrong action the man made happened in the past, and while his past choices generated his resolvable circumstance, that past moral error does not infect the future resolvable dilemma’s morally right decision to cause a morally wrong action.</p><p>Please note that - given how Hursthouse sets up the resolvable dilemma - the man only has two options. I think this is important in the discussion of the ‘lesser of two evils’ because we must realize that this unit of moral experience/judgment is a severely limited circumstance, and that has everything to do with his moral responsibility and the appropriate territory for an ethics theory. </p><p>If this man were to ask a virtuous agent what to do and how to be and so on, even the virtuous agent is confined to only the options of the dilemma when providing the man an answer. This is extremely important because while we want to claim that the man is responsible for the eventual dilemma coming about, he cannot be held responsible in the particular unit of moral experience for acting in a ‘good’ or ‘right’ way that isn’t possible for him to perform. </p><p>We can’t on one hand say the dilemma has only ‘wrong’ actions and still hold him responsible for doing what is right. If there are only ‘wrong actions’ here (as Hursthouse claims), a ‘right’ action is definitionally (from the constraints of the dilemma) impossible to achieve – and for this, we cannot hold the man responsible for not performing a right action. In this sense, for Hursthouse to be willing to claim that the man does a ‘right’ action, he must do something that isn’t possible for him to do (e.g. not one of the dilemmic options: perhaps making a time machine, going back in time, and stopping himself from making the initial mistake, etc). I believe we cannot hold the man responsible for the impossible.</p><p>When we judge this unit of moral experience, it must be done specifically within the confines of the possible choices, as this would actually maintain the man’s moral culpability. To expect more than what is possible, as Hursthouse clearly does, is to extend his moral responsibility beyond the realm of possibility within the dilemma. I don’t think the realm of impossibility (even within a resolvable dilemma such as this) is something for which one can be morally culpable, and thus it is outside the realm of both moral guidance and assessment altogether. Even the virtuous agent’s choice/action is strictly within the realm of possibility and remains virtuous because the moral standard (in this case, the virtuous person himself) cannot do anything but what is possible for him to do (Hursthouse will disagree, but she shouldn’t). The unvirtuous person, likewise, must be held to a standard which is possible to achieve in order to preserve both moral responsibility, morality, and any domain whatsoever for normative ethics.</p><p>If we assume that if a decision has a moral status, the resulting action will also have a moral status (not necessarily the same one, even though I think they will); and, as Hursthouse claims, the man makes a morally right decision in the resolvable dilemma; then we know for a fact that the action will also have a moral status. If we deny that a man can be responsible for doing what is impossible, and thus explain right action and wrong action will both be explained only in terms of what it is possible for him to do, then it becomes very reasonable to claim that the morally right decision will result in the morally right action (otherwise, some ‘morally wrong decision’ would be the antecedent to the ‘morally right decision’). It does not seem that decision can be separated from action, and it does not seem as though the ‘lesser of two evils’ is really evil at all but, rather, is morally right.</p><p>Hursthouse continues her argument:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>[Even] when the agent is faced with a resolvable moral dilemma through no fault of her own, the lesser of the two great evils that she decides to opt for will still not be a morally right or good act, not one that leaves her with those ‘circumstances [so] requisite to happiness’, namely ‘inward peace of mind, consciousness of integrity, [and] a satisfactory review of [her] own conduct’….On the contrary, it will, or should, leave her with some sort of ‘remainder’.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><p>This is a different approach to severing moral decision from moral action. The idea is that the virtuous agent opts for the right decision, but because the circumstances are especially sad (and arguably do not promote <em>eudaimonia</em>) the agent is therefore not committing a morally right act or ‘good act’. Here she introduces ‘remainder’ to show a difference between the morally wrong act of the vicious person (who would lack remainder) and the (so-called) morally wrong act of the virtuous person, particularly because she feels the virtuous person made the morally right decision (in the right, characteristic way, etc.) where the vicious did not. I see two problems in this example. Let me first address the remainder.</p><p>Oddly, she seems to think that actions which should also include a ‘remainder’ are mutually exclusive from the morally right act. I do not see why this is necessary. To posit a remainder in a ‘lesser of two evils’ dilemma is to posit not decision/act x and y, but rather x1 and x2, and y1 and y2, whereby x1 and y1 are without remainder (obviously vicious options) and x2 and y2 are with remainder. The dilemma for the virtuous agent is not whether or not she will have a remainder (as that is guaranteed) but which decision/action, x2 or y2, is morally correct, including remainder. Remainders, therefore, don’t have to be mutually exclusive from morally right action, as they are directly a part of what makes the action right and separate from what the vicious person (without remainder) might choose. Remainder is not the regret of virtuous choice and action, but rather a very strong sense of regret or sorrow for the state of circumstances over which the agent has no control. </p><p>An agent’s psyche will be disfigured with remainder, constantly reminding her of the terrible aspect of the world which she had encountered. She is not in a position to assess what she chose and did as ‘wrong’, even if she doesn’t like the results compared to what might be possible in other circumstances – she is, however, in a position to assess the state of the world in which she lived, and that will result in great sadness, despite her virtue. I see no reason why the state of the world within a terrible resolvable dilemma, which a virtuous agent mourns deeply, should overwrite an agent’s action as being ‘wrong’. </p><p>Besides the differentiation of the virtuous from the vicious, part of the justification for the ‘remainder’ is that the virtuous agent comes out of the ‘lesser of the evils’ dilemma extremely unhappy in such a way that it detracts from the agent’s pursuit of eudaimonia, the ‘good life’. Worth noting is that her distinction between ‘right’ and ‘good’ begins here, although she doesn’t expound on it until later. Why should we think that the virtuous decision/act should make us eudaimonically ‘happy’ outside of our contentment with having chosen/done/been as we ought for the sake of Virtue? Hursthouse is claiming that the ‘right’ action must promote eudaimonia. Let us not underestimate the magnitude of Hursthouse’s claim here because it is the very crux of her virtue ethics theory. Essentially, if an act should make us eudaimonically happy outside of having done what is right according to virtue, then it seems as if eudaimonia, rather than virtue alone (as defined by the virtuous person), is the end objective standard by which we can understand whether or not an action is right or wrong. It seems as if Hursthouse is claiming that a virtuous agent has made the correct moral decision; but because the consequences of the action make the virtuous agent eudaimonically unhappy (outside of being content with having chosen the right moral decision) the resulting action is not ‘good’ (although, oddly, somehow not ‘bad’) and therefore not ‘right’. </p><p>Hursthouse wants to claim that ‘right action’ is a defining ingredient to ‘good action’. It seems here, in her initial explanation of the divide between ‘right’ and ‘good’, that what makes an action ‘wrong’ is that it wasn’t ‘good’. I can see how ‘wrong action’ makes for ‘failed pursuit of eudaimonia’. I do not see how ‘failed pursuit of eudaimonia’ makes for ‘wrong action’, though.  The pursuit of eudaimonia can fail for non-moral reasons and due to things which are outside the moral responsibility of agent. It seems as if ‘wrong’ should be defined by exclusively what the virtuous agent actually does, regardless of its implications to eudaimonia.</p><p>Thus, given Hursthouse’s passage above, I think it is inappropriate to judge the decision as morally right on the standard of virtue, but the action as morally wrong on the standard of eudaimonia. She needs to stick with one ethical standard of measurement or the other. In order to keep this a discussion about Virtue ethics (and  not Eudaimonic ethics), Hursthouse needs to claim that virtue ethics is the sole standard by which one judges the moral worth of decisions and actions. This, however, would require her to say that the moral status of decision entails the moral status of action. If this were the case, she would say that the virtuous decision is also the virtuous action, even in the case of the ‘lesser of two evils’.</p><p>These arguments should be a strong rebuttal to her claim:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The question, ‘Which is the morally right decision, to do x or to do y?’, is confounded with the very different question, ‘Which is the morally right action (with no qualification about remainder, the good action about which the agent need feel no regret), x or y?’ If there are no irresolvable dilemmas, the first question does not pose a false dilemma, but even if every moral dilemma is resolvable, the second certainly does, for the correct answer may well be ‘Neither’.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Clearly, I am rebutting the very notion that decision and action have independent moral statuses. Even within ‘lesser of two evils’ resolvable dilemmas, it is invalid to suggest that it is possible to have a morally correct decision but simultaneously impossible to have a morally correct action (this brings us back to the moral responsibility issue I’ve raised before). Any circumstance in which you can choose virtuously, you can subsequently act virtuously. </p><p>Decision and action are strongly, causally entwined such that both maintain the same moral status, even if it is a decision/action which requires that the virtuous agent possess a remainder, regretting the circumstance but not the decision/action, and perhaps detracting from the agents path to eudaimonia, which I believe must be secondary to virtue if we are to maintain a virtue ethics theory. </p><p><strong> [1b]</strong></p><p>Let me preface this section by saying that I think the two major critiques I’ve offered are related, and I think rebuttals to one have serious implications for the other. I will offer some of the ways I think Hursthouse might rebut my second major criticism, namely the severing of action and decision.</p><p>Hursthouse may rebut part of my argument when she says:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>And since one cannot decide to feel regret, and feeling regret is not an act in the required sense, [the vast majority of those who ask, ‘Which is the right act, x or y?’] thereby cut themselves off from thinking of bringing in that sort of ‘sort of remainder’.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button>  
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>We seem driven to saying that when the dilemma is resolvable (and the agent is in it through no fault of her own), the only feasible emotional remainder is that the agent deeply regret the circumstances that made doing x necessary” is different from “the agent deeply regrets the circumstances that made her doing x necessary.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>If remainder is not really an ‘act’ or ‘choice’, and remainder is a required result in ‘lesser of two evils’ resolvable dilemmas, she might be able to construe ‘action’ alone (without remainder) as not being ‘good enough’ and somehow wrong while the decision is right. </p><p>Hursthouse might dogmatically and axiomatically claim that actions in themselves, outside of the contextual, possibility, and moral responsibility objections I’ve raised, are strictly right or wrong and strictly independent of choice. I can say I’m slightly tempted by this argument. It seems natural to decry the action of a ‘lesser of two evils” as being not as good as throwing my son a birthday party or having dinner with my wife. Again, this assessment must be decontextualized and ignore (what I consider to be important) aspects of moral responsibility. </p><p>Another interesting, possible rebuttal stems from this quote:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Consider again the distinctly non-virtuous man who has induced two women to bear a child of his by convincing each that he intends to marry her, under the assumption that it would be worse to abandon A than B[…]The virtue ethics account refuses to assure him that in marrying A he would be doing ‘a morally right act—a good deed’. He will not, in marrying A, be ‘doing what a virtuous agent would, characteristically, do in the circumstances’, because no virtuous agent would have got himself into these circumstances in the first place.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>If we discount the possibility of a virtuous person ever actually finding themselves in a ‘lesser of two evils’ resolvable dilemma, and essentially we claim that truly virtuous agents (from the beginning of their moral lives, continuing on) are<em> cosmically destined</em> to never be in a circumstance which might result in ‘wrong’ action (with ‘right’ decision), then we could avoid a contradiction in saying that a virtuous agent can ‘do what is wrong’ but still maintain that action and decision can be severed in cases of the unvirtuous. This, though, likely has powerful implications for anyone who has ever been unvirtuous. Of course, the virtuous agent could not give anything like meaningful ethical advice to the unvirtuous man, but that might be acceptable to Hursthouse. Here it makes slightly more sense to be able to say that, with respect to the virtuous person, right decision and action are the same thing, and there is only separation in the case of the unvirtuous. (This would, however, definitely contradict her tragic dilemmas.)
  
Hursthouse does claim the following:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>[A] resolvable dilemma which arises in circumstances in which a virtuous agent might well find herself will be resolvable by a morally right decision, and what is done, such as ‘x, after much painful thought, feeling deep regret, and doing such-and-such by way of restitution’ will be assessed as morally right. Resolvable dilemmas which no virtuous agent would ever be faced with will also be resolvable by a morally right decision, but what is done will not be assessed as morally right.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>This differs with any cosmic destiny argument because the virtuous agent does face supposed ‘lesser of two evils’ resolvable dilemmas. We might say that the virtuous agent simply never faces the same type of ‘lesser of two evils’ dilemmas as the unvirtuous person. This passage protects the virtuous agent from ever moving from ‘right decision’ to ‘wrong action’ in resolvable dilemmas. The distinction here is that only the unvirtuous can have ‘right decision’ lead to ‘wrong action’ in resolvable dilemmas. In this, a rightness-preserving relationship between decision and action can only belong to the virtuous.</p><p>The passage seems to indicate that ‘the way’ in which the virtuous person considers and responds to a dilemma is different from how the non-virtuous person is capable of considering and responding. Perhaps, for example, the virtuous agent’s characteristic approach is simply impossible to achieve for the unvirtuous in any particular dilemma like this. If Hursthouse is willing to throw my conception of moral responsibility out the window, and truly expects the unvirtuous agent to perform in such a way that is impossible (the exact way in which the virtuous agent does), then her theory has merit.</p><p>Perhaps the above passage is definitional in nature. In the same way that some argue that whatever God does is definitionally right (regardless of what He does), we can argue that the virtuous agent carries the same rightness-making torch. On whatever path virtuous persons may find themselves, they are automatically on the right path by definition such that even in ‘lesser of two evils’ resolvable dilemmas, the virtuous path simply cannot be wrong. This argument might amount to expanding temporal scope such that the smallest unit of moral experience would actually encompass an entire lifetime, and in this way virtuous agent can only do what is right, and the unvirtuous, despite some morally right decisions, is performing wrong action.</p><p>While I can’t find a citation for this rebuttal, if Hursthouse were to admit compatibilism (her teacher certainly did) or deny my libertarian notion of moral responsibility, it would sweep away my argument. It would be a forceful argument to claim that moral responsible has nothing to do with what is possible. In my view, if she were to admit this, it would be just as reasonable to sever decision and action, as we need no strong causal, morally responsible link between these two things. </p><p>She might argue that an action is both wrong and right. Take the unvirtuous man with marital promises to two woman as an example - perhaps he would be ‘callous to abandon’<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button>  either one, but ‘virtuous’ to some degree in fulfilling his promise to one. I suppose degrees of virtue could make sense of this. We’d say he’s 40% right or something? I’m not convinced by such an account, but it might allow Hursthouse to separate moral decision from moral action and for even the ‘lesser of two evils’ to really be evil to some degree.</p><p><strong>[2a]</strong></p><p>According to Hursthouse, a tragic dilemma is a “situation in which the agent’s moral choice lies between x and y and there are no moral grounds for favouring doing x over doing y”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button>  and in which “it is impossible to emerge with clean hands”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">13</sup></button>  (or virtuously die<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">14</sup></button>) because both x and y are neither ‘acting well’ nor ‘acting badly’<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">15</sup></button>  but instead both x and y are characteristically vicious actions in themselves and contradictory to the nature of the virtuous person, resulting in the virtuous agent’s life being left forever ‘marred’ after performing either x or y.</p><p><strong>[Substantial Aspect #1]</strong></p><p>An extremely interesting aspect of her theory is the notion that two different virtuous agents may choose to act differently in a tragic dilemma. This is a result of tragic dilemmas being a type of irresolvable dilemma. Nonetheless, we must ask what ‘a’ (not ‘the’) virtuous agent would do in a tragic dilemma. Hursthouse explains:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Virtuous agents themselves recognize the dilemma as irresolvable, as one in which, even given their particular standards or ideals or whatever, there is no moral ground for favouring one action rather the other […Both virtuous agents] thought about [the irresolvable dilemma] carefully, conscientiously, and wisely, arriving, after much agonized thought, at the conclusion that neither decision here was the correct one.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">16</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Importantly, all virtuous agents recognize that there is no one correct decision. What this means is that virtuous agents are limited (Hursthouse says ‘no moral guidance’, but depending on the type of tragic irresolvable dilemma, she may be slightly overstating) in their ability to provide moral guidance in tragic dilemmas. This is different from resolvable dilemmas in which all virtuous agents actually can (and do) provide (the same) moral guidance.</p><p>This is likely one of the ‘sticking points’ for Hursthouse’s audience. She seems aware of how awkward it might seem to others to say that virtuous agents can actually perform different acts under the exact same circumstances. This is not usually how we think of the virtuous agent. I, however, think she’s right! </p><p>While Hursthouse may find my defense/explanation of her claim too mechanistic (perhaps too close to theoretical codification to her liking), I believe it more formally captures why this substantial claim of hers is reasonable. I wish to do her claim justice, and if we might disagree on small aspects of it, I’ll explain where and why. Here is how I have tried to make sense of her claim within virtue theory.</p><p>Suppose I create an abstraction of a conversation (seeking moral guidance) with a virtuous person as the function P(Q), whereby I can ask (‘input’) a virtuous agent what I should do given an exact specification of my circumstances (or if we want to say the virtuous agent is ‘in my shoes’, that’s fine as well) such that Q-circumstance is the input to virtuous agent P in function P(Q). The virtuous agent can provide me, after characteristic contemplation and application of her moral wisdom, what single option a virtuous person would choose or, as in the case of irresolvable dilemmas, from what range of equally valued options a virtuous person must choose in my particular circumstance.</p><p>Q must include all relevant truths required by the virtuous person to make a virtuous decision, and among these circumstantial facts are the possible actions available in this particular unit of moral experience. When I write out examples of Q, I am only going to represent the list of possible decision/actions (we need not separate them as Hursthouse thinks) - we’re simply going to assume the other facts which describe the circumstance are also contained in that list, but I won’t be writing them all out because they aren’t necessary to represent for the rest of the discussion. So Q = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] means that within a particular world or circumstance Q, I have 5 mutually exclusive options/actions available (presumably, 5 is a severe underestimation in most cases).</p><p>If we input Q into function P(Q), and P([a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]) = a2, where a2 is the resulting output of the input Q into that function P, then we are saying that if I asked a virtuous agent (P) what one ought to do in a given circumstance (Q), which we both understand to have only 5 possible options, [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], that the agent is telling me to do a2 because it is the virtuous option. It is the case that a2 is the morally right option in this particular world Q. Note that I could have this particular conversation with any number of virtuous agents, and a2 would always be the answer I receive, and, it would also be the option that any virtuous agent would choose/be/act in Q.</p><p>What it means to be in an irresolvable moral dilemma is to have something more complex than an atomic answer like a2; instead, a virtuous agent’s answer must be a range of options which the virtuous agent believes to be equally valued given world Q. When this happens, the virtuous function/agent can provide no moral grounds to choose between members of the dilemmic set. So, P([a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]) = [a2, a3] is the equivalent of the virtuous agent coming to realize (and expressing to me) that given world Q with options [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], there is an irresolvable dilemma between a2 and a3. Any selection from the dilemmic set [a2, a3] is morally ‘better’ (I prefer ‘right’, but because the word is controversial in Hursthouse’s theory, I’ll use the weaker word ‘better’ here) compared to the other options in Q, namely [a1, a4, a5]. However, a2 with respect to a3 (and vice versa) is <em>amoral</em>; [a2, a3] forms the dilemma, and its members are equally valued by the virtuous agent.  There is no moral guidance as to whether one should choose either a2 or a3, but there is still moral guidance when the virtuous agent tells me I should either choose a2 or a3 <em>instead </em>of a1, a4, or a5.</p><p>The dilemmic set [a2, a3] is therefore morally right with respect to Q,[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], but the members of [a2, a3] are amoral with respect to each other. We know this because if we ask the virtuous agent, after she has told us that we ought to perform either a2 or a3 from Q, which we should do - a2 or a3 - she cannot provide a different answer. This is equivalent to removing [a1, a4, a5] from Q, such that Q’ = [a2, a3], resulting in P([a2, a3]) = [a2, a3]. This equation describes us asking the virtuous agent whether to do a2 or a3 given our circumstance Q’ (a reduced and hypothetical form of Q) and the virtuous agent is saying she doesn’t know which one to choose. To say a moral function provides no answer (or no different answer than the input), or to say that the virtuous person has no moral grounds on which to choose either a2 or a3 in Q’, is the same thing as saying this is an amoral question. </p><p>Now, clearly, the virtuous agent’s narrowing down of [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] to either an atomic (a2) or a dilemmic set ([a2, a3]) shows that virtue ethics has something to say about world Q, and thus, in this respect, it is real question in the realm of morality. But, if one receives a dilemmic set answer from a virtuous agent, to go on and ask a second question, namely should we choose a2 or a3 from dilemmic set [a2, a3], we would receive either the same answer, [a2, a3], or a simple ‘I do not know which one to choose’ from the virtuous agent, showing this is an amoral question, one in which virtue ethics can offer no moral guidance. </p><p>So, there is moral guidance and moral assessment in P([a1, a2, a3, a4, a5])=[a2, a3]; but there is no moral guidance (although there is indirect moral assessment) when we ask our second question, inputting Q’, P([a2, a3]) = [a2, a3]. The second question is amoral, but since the dilemmic set has been selected by the virtuous agent from a larger set of options in question one, namely Q, and our second is a reduced, hypothetical version of Q, namely Q’; we can say that choosing either a2 or a3 (and not a1, a4, or a5) will be the virtuous thing to do, we just can’t say there are any moral reasons to choose a2 with respect to a3, or vice versa. Here we can awkwardly (but rightly) claim that the secondary amoral question has no action guidance, but in light of the moral guidance that narrowed Q to a dilemmic set in the first question, there is action assessment (something Hursthouse should agree to).</p><p>We should also point out that while the word ‘dilemma’ suggests only two equal options, we can account for more than 2 equal options in this approach (e.g. P([a1, a2, a3, a4, a5])=[a1, a3, a4]).</p><p>Now, we might ask what it means if we weren’t reducing Q in the form of a second moral guidance question (Q’) and, in fact, our only options in an actual Q were truly dilemmic. E.g. P([a1, a2, a3] = [a1, a2, a3]. This, then, definitionally, is an amoral question. I’m not positing such a thing actually exists, but we can account for it. Similarly, we need not believe that irresolvable dilemmas actually exist (and I personally think a truly irresolvable dilemma, tragic or pleasant, is extraordinarily difficult to construct), such that a virtuous function would ever tell us that a circumstance had more than one right answer; but this explanation can account for them if they do exist. </p><p>I personally don’t believe there actually exists any such class of Q which is innately amoral (where the options in an actual Q are the same as the output of P) because I ideally think that an initial libertarian choice automatically entails a moral question (that is the point of freewill). I suggest that innately amoral dilemmas have no action guidance or assessment at all (unlike the secondary class derived from astarting moral question). Even if I’m right, this will not contradict the possibility of amoral questions being asked within the dilemmic set which has been selected from a larger body of options because the selection of the dilemmic set from the larger initial set in Q is itself the moral choice.</p><p>Hursthouse may disagree with my perspective here, though. She may believe her example irresolvable dilemmas to be this sort of innately dilemmic Q’s, but somehow not actually amoral. I’m not sure how we can talk about these as moral questions, if that is the case. Unfortunately, it appears as though Hursthouse could be saying in her tragic irresolvable dilemmas argument that virtuous agents would label what I deem innately amoral dilemmas as moral dilemmas such that P(Q) is not the real definition of whether or not a question is moral or amoral. Even though there is no moral choice to make here, she might be tempted to say it is still a moral question. Thus, we may differ on whether or not it is reasonable to think that there is moral assessment outside of what is possible – particularly that in tragic dilemmas, what is ‘right’ is strictly impossible, and I’m unwilling to label the impossible as being ‘moral’ or something for which we can be morally responsible. I cannot her defend her there (if she would make that argument), but I can defend the possibility of two virtuous agents selecting different options.</p><p>For example, I might ask a virtuous person whether or not I should buy a car from a particular car dealer’s lot containing several of the exact same vehicles but in different colors. Perhaps the virtuous agent will tell me I should buy a car from that lot, but also tells me the color doesn’t matter. Even when I ask a follow-up question, ‘which color car should I choose?’ the virtuous agent has absolutely no guidance to provide me (other than that I should buy a car from this lot). What my virtuous guide is telling me is that if two virtuous agents were in this situation, one might buy a red car, and the other a blue car, and both would have done what is morally right. So, the choosing of the color of the car is amoral; the buying of a car from that lot, however, is morally assessable. Note that in buying either the red or the blue car, I’m still performing a moral act with respect to the question, ‘Should I buy a car from this lot?’, but, simultaneously, I am performing the amoral act of selecting the color. The moral and secondary amoral experiences are simultaneous, such that, while the overall question is morally relevant (as I am morally responsible to choose from that range, and ultimately whether or not I buy a car at all), there is a hidden, secondary amoral question resulting as a dilemmic set from any virtuous person’s answer to my first question, and this sort of ‘choice’ is one in which a moral theory has no dominion.</p><p>This seems to match very closely (with some differences regarding ‘right’ and ‘good’ which I will respond to later) the conclusions which Hursthouse will reach regarding how and why it is the case that virtuous agents can and will choose different options in an irresolvable dilemma, including tragic dilemmas. Importantly, as Hursthouse points out, the virtuous agents do recognize that this is an irresolvable dilemma – that is, they know the output to P(Q) is a range.  Given my understanding, then, I have no problem saying that two virtuous people take different options in a truly irresolvable dilemma. Frankly, the virtuous agents could simply flip a coin as to which particular option they choose from the dilemmic set, as it is an amoral question (this does not mean they took lightly the deliberation which led them to understand this to be an irresolvable dilemma - far from it). Within the confines of the dilemmic set, virtue (or any approach as far as I can see) as a theory provides no reason to choose either member over the other. (I think it is worth noting that this approach might also be applicable for many variants of deontology and utility such that they may fair no worse than virtue ethics in how they handle ‘irresolvable dilemmas’.)  </p><p><strong>[Substantial Aspect #2]</strong></p><p>Hursthouse differentiates ‘good’ from ‘right’. This may seem obvious to some, but, frankly, I don’t think it is so obvious at all. There are tons of implications to this distinction, and they are very prominent within Hursthouse’s explanation of tragic dilemmas. I need to carefully show what she means in this distinction because my epicentral criticism is founded in my disagreement with her on this issue (so please be patient).</p><p>In the discussion of tragic dilemmas and how two virtuous agents can choose different options, Hursthouse unfolds her grander argument for the distinction between ‘good’ and ‘right’. She says of virtuous agents in tragic dilemmas:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But here it seems to be quite inappropriate to say that each acts well, mirroring the fact (I take it to be a fact) that it is quite inappropriate to say, with respect to tragic irresolvable dilemmas, that both agents do what is right. If anything, the temptation is to say that both do what is wrong. So it looks as though I am going to be forced to say that both agents act badly.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">17</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><p>She defends the virtuous agent’s manner of acting (saving the argument from a possible contradiction) by saying:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The charitable, honest, just agent, even when faced with a tragic dilemma, does not act callously, dishonestly, unjustly, that is ‘as (in the manner) the callous, dishonest, unjust agent does’. She acts with immense regret and pain instead of indifferently or gladly, as the callous or dishonest or unjust one does. So we are not forced to say that the virtuous agents faced with tragic dilemmas act badly. They don’t; it is the vicious who act badly.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">18</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Thus, we can say that the virtuous agent within a tragic dilemma acted neither ‘well’ nor ‘badly’. These words are helping us identify Hursthouse’s conception of ‘goodness’ (‘well’ = ‘good’) as distinct from ‘rightness’. She explains that the virtuous agent does what is ‘wrong’ in tragic dilemmas, and are thus said to have not acted ‘well’. The virtuous agent’s saving grace, however, is that she is nothing like the vicious, as evidenced by an overpowering sense of regret and anguish (remainder). The virtuous agent takes an extreme displeasure (unlike the vicious) in performing a ‘wrong act’, truly against the agent’s virtuous nature and character; and thus, Hursthouse explains, while they are doing what is ‘morally wrong’ they are not ‘acting badly’. So, the virtuous way in which a virtuous agent acted defines the act as not being ‘bad’, but because she didn’t ‘act well’ her act is ‘wrong’. I am unsure of the status of virtue in this section. It seems as if virtue defines ‘bad action’ and partially ‘morally right action’, not eudaimonia; but then eudaimonia mostly defines ‘good action’ and ‘morally wrong action’, not virtue. </p><p>The virtuous agent emerges from a tragic dilemma as “having done a terrible thing, the very sort of thing that the callous, dishonest, unjust, or in general vicious agent would characteristically do.…hence it will not be possible to say that she has acted well”.  She didn’t act badly, but she didn’t act well. The result is having her life ‘marred’. (Quite a word!) A marred life cannot be recovered. Hursthouse terms it a tragic dilemma because even the virtuous agent is forced to do something which is morally wrong and fails to ‘act well’ (even if they do not ‘act badly’). So, her new definition of a right action looks like:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>An action is right iff it is what a virtuous agent would, characteristically, do in the circumstances, except for tragic dilemmas, in which a decision is right iff it is what such an agent would decide, but the action decided upon may be too terrible to be called ‘right’ or ‘good’.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">20</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The marred life is a ‘good life’ which has been ruined due to a tragic dilemma. Again, ‘good act’ is synonymous with ‘acting well’ just as ‘good life’ is synonymous with having ‘lived well’. One might say the remainder of a tragic dilemma is a forever marred life. </p><p>Note that in normal circumstances, pleasant resolvable dilemmas, and pleasant irresolvable dilemmas, the virtuous agent makes ‘morally right decisions’ and performs ‘morally right actions’ and can also be understood to have ‘acted well’. In ‘lesser of two evils’ resolvable dilemmas the virtuous agent makes ‘morally right decisions’ and performs ‘morally right actions’ but may not necessarily be understood to have ‘acted well’ although certainly not ‘badly’ (the good/bad question wasn’t strongly answered for this case). In tragic irresolvable dilemmas, the virtuous agent makes ‘morally right decisions’, but is said to have performed ‘morally wrong actions’, and understood to have neither ‘acted well’ nor ‘acted badly’ and instead to have had her life ‘marred’. </p><p>So, a virtuous person always makes the ‘morally right decision’, but doesn’t necessarily perform the ‘morally right action’. When a virtuous agent is not performing a ‘morally right action’, we see she isn’t ‘acting well’ and that her life is ‘marred’.
 
Hursthouse continues in her argument:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>’good action’ is not merely a surrogate for ‘right action’, nor is it simply determined by ‘action of the virtuous agent’. Virtue ethics does not hold that actions are good, bad, or indifferent, as some people hold that actions are right, wrong, or permissible; nor does it call what the virtuous agent does (for the most part) ‘good action’ for want of any other phrase. ‘Good action’ is so called advisedly, and although it is conceptually linked to morally correct (right) decision and to ‘action of the virtuous agent’, it is also conceptually linked to ‘good life’ and eudaimonia.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">21</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>This is a vital passage in her explanation of ‘right’ and ‘good’, and ‘wrong’ and ‘bad’. ‘Good action’ then must be understood in terms of a virtuous agent performing not only both ‘morally right decision’ and ‘morally right action’, but also in terms of how the action (not the decision) promotes the ‘good life’ and eudaimonia. Clearly, ‘right’ is different from ‘good’ because ‘right’ does not describe the full meaning of ‘good’ to Hursthouse. The ‘rightness’ of an action is only one ingredient to the ‘goodness’ of an action. The missing ingredient to the ‘goodness’ of an action is its eudaimonic preserving and promoting properties. </p><p>Insofar as the virtuous agent has effectively pursued and maintained the ‘good life’, she can be said to have not encountered tragic dilemmas (a result of ‘moral luck’), to have exclusively ‘acted well’ or performed ‘good actions’ in her life, and as a part of that eudaimonic life equation, she used her virtuous character to make ‘morally correct decisions’ and perform ‘morally right acts’. </p><p>Beyond issues of what it means for Hursthouse to distinguish ‘morally right decision’ from ‘morally right action’, we can see another power at work in her theory of ethics. It seems as if the virtuous agent isn’t just pursuing what is ‘right’, but much more - particularly what is ‘good’. Hursthouse is explaining that ‘right’ isn’t necessarily ‘good’ enough. This has several ramifications to virtue theory. She goes on to explain what it means to be a virtuous agent given her conception of ‘good’ and ‘right’:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>What constitutes the (true) good of others, and when life is and is not a good, are amongst the things that the virtuous person knows and can recognize, but they are so not because she recognizes them but because of facts about human nature.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">22</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>So, the virtuous agent has the knowledge of what makes a ‘good life’. The virtuous person recognizes ‘good’ and realizes that this is separate from ‘right’. The virtuous person does ‘right’ in the pursuit of ‘good’. </p><p>Given her distinction, she also goes on to disown the notion that “character has primacy over action”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">23</sup></button>  within virtue ethics insofar as tragic dilemmas are concerned, or more specifically, insofar as the ‘right’ is not the ‘good’. As Hursthouse sees it: </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>No virtue ethics inspired by Aristotle is committed to a reductive definition of the concepts of good and evil in terms of that of the virtuous agent, only to maintaining a close connection between them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">24</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>This is a powerful statement, in my view. She is saying that the ‘good’ in Virtue ethics is not exclusively defined by the ‘virtuous agent’ or the ‘virtues’ themselves.</p><p><strong>[Epicentral Criticism]</strong></p><p>As in the previous question, I have a substantial problem with Hursthouse’s distinction between ‘good’ and ‘right’ as being different moral standards by which we can assess an agent’s actions such that the moral status of actions are severed from the status of decisions. The root problem of Hursthouse’s theory is that she applies two different standards of ethics, eudaimonia and the virtuous person. </p><p>It does seem that Hursthouse will claim that ‘morally right decision’ (and moral guidance) is entirely defined by the virtuous person. But, when we get to ‘action’, a mixed set of standards are applied. Because of how she negotiates action assessment in a multitude of terms - ‘good’, bad’, ‘wrong’, and ‘right - we can see that the ‘eudaimonic persons’ are ‘virtuous persons’, but not all ‘virtuous persons’ are ‘eudaimonic persons’. Where the latter occurs, she wishes to relabel ‘virtuous’ as ‘marred’ and, in my eyes, ‘unvirtuous’ (because they do what is morally wrong!).</p><p>In the tragic dilemma, the virtuous person is held to the standard of virtue by not having performed ‘bad action’ (oddly, this is a eudaimonic term) because they performed the act in a virtuous manner. The virtuous person is then held to the standard of eudaimonia by not having performed a ‘good action’ because the action is not promoting the ‘good life’. Why should virtue be the standard for ‘bad action’ but not ‘good action’?  Hursthouse denies the natural inclination to say that the virtuous person does what is right, and instead, because of how she applies the eudaimonic standard, the virtuous agent is said to have performed ‘wrong action’ in light of it being ‘not good action’ - which somehow isn’t the same as ‘bad’) and provides us with a flashy middle term - ‘marred’. Wouldn’t ‘bad action’ (and nothing else) be exactly that which leads to the ‘non-good’ or ‘bad’ or ‘marred’ or ‘un-eudaimonic’ life? The problem is that ‘not good action’ somehow translates into ‘morally wrong action’ – I don’t see why. </p><p>I can understand ‘morally wrong action’ leading to ‘bad action’ and the ‘bad life’. I can understand ‘morally right action’ leading to ‘good action’ and the ‘good life’. I can also understand (as Hursthouse does not seem to) ‘morally right action’ leading to ‘bad action’ and the ‘bad life’. These sentences employ virtue ethics as the sole domain of moral assessment, and it is mere happenstance that how one defines the ‘good life’ can only be achieved through morally correct action, but even if you do not live the ‘good life’, I don’t see why one must say you haven’t performed morally right action. </p><p>As far as I can tell, if Hursthouse refuses to play fairly, using a single standard (virtue), then her theory of ethics collapses into eudaimonic ethics, which frankly sounds a lot like utility. One should perform those things which maximize the eudaimonic brand of happiness, etc. Even in Utility, people have maximum ‘caps’ to the ‘happiness’ that can be achieved, and it would be asinine to expect them to ever attain more from a moral standpoint. Eudaimonic ethics seems an outright impossible standard and a non-starter from the get go. Now, if virtue ethics is to remain a distinctive and unique theory of ethics, it cannot rely upon any application of the eudaimonic standard in moral assessment. To do this will require that her theory define ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ solely in terms of the virtuous person. </p><p>So, even in tragic dilemmas, Hursthouse would need to say that the virtuous agent made a morally correct decision and performed a morally correct act (as these are the things a virtuous agent characteristically chooses and performs); and, incidentally, woe unto the virtuous agent because she will be ‘marred’ with a remainder that prevents her from living a eudaimonically happy life. Nonetheless, the agent is virtuous and has done nothing immoral.</p><p><strong>[2b]</strong></p><p>Let me be forthcoming, I’m not sure how Hursthouse can defend against this criticism (I wouldn’t have levied it as an epicentral criticism if I thought it was easy to rebut). </p><p>She might accuse me of this:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>One might try to wriggle out of this problem by putting a loaded interpretation on ‘characteristically’. Suppose that the right decision is to kill someone, or let them die, to betray a trust, to break a terribly serious promise. That is what the virtuous agent does—in the circumstances. But, given that they are charitable, true to their word, just, do they not act ‘uncharacteristically’, out of character, when they do these terrible things?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">25</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>But I think my contention isn’t this, as I’m convinced the virtuous person characteristically will do what she calls ‘wrong’ in tragic dilemmas. </p><p>I think she really wants to argue against what I’ve said by claiming that actions, independent of possibility and context, are innately wrong and right as they relate to eudaimonia. She wants to say that eudaimonia is good outside of whether one can possibly pursue it. Of course, this form of denying moral responsibility would allow her to bypass my criticism. </p><p>Hursthouse really would not appreciate my hardline view of ‘right’ and ‘good’ as not being distinct in the end (both are ‘worth pursuing’ and the object of ‘ought’ or ‘should’). At best, one might say that the ‘right’ things are a means to the ‘good’ (but I see this only as a preliminary separation). The ‘good’ here, then, is the first ‘right’ or the primal valuable thing worth pursing and all other ‘right’ pursuits are born of the first. So, the means to an end, as the path to the ‘good’, become part of the ‘good’ in themselves I would say. She would want to strongly point out that the casual path is incidental, and these secondary ‘rights’ are thus distinct from ‘good’ as being incidental ‘oughts’. So, ‘right’ would be a much weaker word in a sense for her than for me. Even with no possible path, the ‘good’ remains what you ‘ought’ to pursue in her eyes. Again, she would need to say that we should pursue eudaimonia even where it is impossible and hold us accountable for ‘moral luck’. </p><p>Lastly, it would be a forceful argument to explicitly claim that eudaimonia has primacy to character (which she alludes to, but does not state). Yes, this would be along the lines of Virtue ethics no longer being about the virtuous person, only indirectly linked. Perhaps it is just incidental that characters traits are the way she wants to help us understand what comprises the eudaimonic person. </p><p><strong>[3]</strong></p><p>Aristotle used the word arete, meaning excellence, to describe virtue. This isn’t exactly what we usually mean by ‘virtue’ though because aretaic practices included more than morality. We really mean moral excellence and <em>moral virtue</em>, which Aristotle describes as <em>aretai ethikai</em>. Foot holds (no pun intended) there are “four cardinal moral virtues: courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice,”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">26</sup></button>  which differs from the traditional Aristotelian and Thomistic belief that only three of these are moral virtues. The traditional approach labels wisdom or ‘practical wisdom’ as being an intellectual virtue which remains separate from but still related to the moral virtues.</p><p>Foot is claiming that wisdom is part intellectual virtue and part moral virtue. Let’s start with the most important one: What makes something a moral virtue? </p><p>Foot explains that “virtues are, in some general way, beneficial.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">27</sup></button>  Who benefits from the virtues: the virtuous, those surrounding the virtuous, or all of them? Foot says, “courage, temperance and wisdom benefit both the person who has these dispositions and other people as well.”  Depending on how you look at justice (the missing cardinal virtue from that list), it may or may not detract from the possessor, but we know it benefits those surrounding the possessor. Justice is also complicated because it may interfere with the common human good, given the nature of rights and duties which accompany the virtue. </p><p>Of course, not every quality which is beneficial is said to be a virtue.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">29</sup></button>  Certain biological and evolutionary features seem to be beneficial to persons, but they aren’t the sorts of qualities for which individuals are generally responsible. What separates the non-moral beneficent qualities from the moral virtues is the will. All things which an agent wills (or should will) are things for which they are responsible, unlike non-moral beneficent (and malevolent) qualities. Since moral responsibility stems from an agent’s (I would argue, but Foot doesn’t, “free”) will, and because the virtues and the cultivation of virtuous character are the sorts of beneficial things for which we are responsible, it can be said that “Virtue belongs to the will.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">30</sup></button>  As Foot explains, “Virtue is not, like a skill or an art, a mere capacity: it must actually engage the will.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">31</sup></button>   Virtue, then, isn’t something that can be exclusively genetic, but rather it must contain elements of will, and must be chosen, acted upon and habituated. Oddly, one must also say that virtue is the sort of disposition and inclination from which we enact our will. The way in which these dispositions are habituated must be related to the will, and the way in which one employs these dispositions in a final choice is also important. Consider this illustration:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Paul stood passively as Kynes inspects the suit. It had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his foreconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of ajudsting theadhesion tabs under Gurner’s inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters. 
Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. “You’ve worn a stillsuit before?” he asked.
		“This is the first time.”
		“Then someone adjusted it for you?”
		“No.”
		Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do that?”
		“It . . . seemed the right way.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">32</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>One must contend with Paul’s natural, instinctive disposition to clothe himself for proper survival in an extreme desert. He isn’t genetically superior in his ability to retain water, he is superior in his natural inclination to wear the stillsuit (the object which will save his life and indirectly benefit others in this story) correctly and to know how to survive and live well on the desert planet. What he wills in this story is beneficial, and thus, it might be said to be a result of some strain of moral virtue.</p><p>With that said, what is the will? Foot describes will in terms of desire, intention, attitude, and perhaps spirit.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">33</sup></button>  As she puts it, the will “cover[s] what is wished for as well as what is sought.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">34</sup></button>  Virtuous agents actively seek out opportunities to do good deeds and to be virtuous. They do not sit passively intending to do what is right; they will to be virtuous with no “deficiency of motivation.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">35</sup></button>  Virtuous agents leap at the chance to employ the virtues, their deepest desires and hopes are virtuous, and their deepest fears and what they hope to prevent are the vices. </p><p>Importantly, Foot sees the virtues as being corrective of the vices, and she posits “If human nature had been different there would have been no need of a corrective disposition.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">36</sup></button>  We are forced to ask questions like: Are we born vicious? Are these the sorts of things for which we are responsible? Can you be responsible for your own nature? If the vices are imbued in human nature, and we aren’t responsible for our human nature, then it seems as if the vices are psychological states for which we aren’t entirely responsible. It seems that Foot’s understanding of vice does not employ the will to the same extent as her understanding of virtue. If one can accept the theory of compatibilism (I don’t), then I am making a fuss about nothing here; if you reject compatibilism, however, then Foot’s argument has a serious contradiction (again, one based in what it means to be morally responsible for both vice and virtue).</p><p>I believe the will is the portion of an agent’s psychological makeup for which she is responsible (and nature isn’t); essentially, I embrace freewill as the necessary precursor to any coherent discussion of ethics. It is here that Foot may disagree with me. She denies freewill and embraces compatibilism, which is the idea that the will, as a cause of moral responsibility, is compatible with physical determinism – the will need not be ‘free’ in her conception.</p><p>The movie <em>The Terminator</em> exemplifies my point here. Briefly, an artificial intelligence network called Skynet becomes ‘self-aware’ and starts a nuclear holocaust of mankind. Skynet develops post-apocalyptic machines (terminators) to go back in time to terminate Sarah Connor, who, left alive, will eventually enable man’s resistance to the apocalypse initiated by Skynet. Skynet is considered ‘evil’ in this story by many, but not by me. From my perspective, even if Skynet and the terminators displayed some form of ‘awareness’ and ‘reason’, because these computers and machines were bound by the laws of physics, they lack true autonomy, they lack freewill, thus aren’t morally responsible, and therefore they have done neither ‘evil’ nor ‘good’ in trying to end Sarah Connor’s life or initiate the nuclear holocaust. I would say that the engineers (and stockholders) of Cyberdyne Systems which developed and employed the microprocessor that formed the basis of Skynet are the responsible parties for the future nuclear holocaust. Skynet and the army of terminators had no ‘real’ choice to do otherwise. Skynet was just a very advanced box of electronic and quantum billiard balls connecting with other billiard balls, fully bound and described by the laws of physics, fully deterministic and not responsible for what happens. No matter how human the terminators become, they lack libertarian freewill, and thus to find who is morally responsible for the ‘evil’ of the nuclear holocaust, we must go back in the deterministic causal chain until we reach the sort of freewill choices that led to Skynet and the terminators, and that would be the engineers and stockholders of Cyberdyne Systems.</p><p>Foot’s disagreement on the issue of compatibilism would amount to holding Skynet morally responsible. She would need to call Skynet’s and the terminators’ deterministic circuits a will. Assuming I am at an impasse with Foot on this issue, let us move on with her theory.</p><p>With a conception of the beneficial will as the root of the virtues, Foot goes on to describe the cardinal virtue of wisdom as making the relationship between the other moral virtues and the will as complex and difficult to define. Foot explains:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Practical wisdom, we said, was counted by Aristotle among the intellectual virtues, and while our wisdom is not quite the same as phronesis or prudentia, it too might seem to belong to the intellect rather than the will. Is not wisdom a matter of knowledge, and how can knowledge be a matter of intention or desire? The answer is that it isn’t, so that there is good reason for thinking of wisdom as an intellectual virtue. But on the other hand wisdom has special connections with the will, meeting it at more than one point.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">37</sup></button> 
</p></blockquote><p>Intellectual virtues are concerned with knowledge. Foot explains that knowledge is not a matter of intention or desire. So, intellectual virtues are not easily related to intention and desire, which means intellectual virtues are not easily related to the will. On one hand, Foot wants to say that the intellect and the will are separate, but because of wisdom, which seems to have a stake in both intellectual and moral virtues, she wants to say that the intellect and will are very related. Foot continues:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Wisdom, as I see it, has two parts. In the first place the wise man knows the means to certain good ends; and secondly he knows how much particular ends are worth.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">38</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>The wise agent obviously needs certain sorts of knowledge. Wisdom includes knowledge of which ends are valuable, good ends belonging to human life.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">39</sup></button>  Foot continues:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Wisdom is to be contrasted with cleverness because cleverness is the ability to take the right steps to any end, whereas wisdom is related only to good ends, and to human life in general rather than to the ends of particular arts.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">40</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Foot is describing wisdom as including the knowledge of ‘how to act well’ and how to achieve the good ends in the virtuous manner. Cleverness does not fit the bill. A virtuous agent and a non-virtuous clever agent may (incidentally) have the same end, but how they go about arriving at that end and the sorts choices they make to bring about that end may very well differ because it is the virtuous character which defines the moral path to that end for the virtuous agent, not cleverness or efficiency or anything else.</p><p>Wisdom isn’t just about knowledge; it is also that which one must will. As Foot puts it, wisdom “presupposes good ends: the man who is wise does not merely know how to do good things…but must also want to do them.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">41</sup></button>  It is perfectly imaginable for a man, for instance, to know how to do the virtuous thing and yet choose not to do it.  Dostoevsky illustrates this concept in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don't want harmony. From love for humanity I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return him the ticket.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">42</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, “Wisdom, in so far as it consists of knowledge which anyone can gain in the course of an ordinary life, is available to anyone who really wants [or wills for] it.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">43</sup></button>  Foot also describes the foolish man as having ‘false values’ stemming from ‘false judgment’ and so, conversely, wisdom is “partly to be described in terms of apprehension, and even judgment, but since it has to do with a man’s attachments it also characterizes the will.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">44</sup></button>
 
Let me first point out that Foot is claiming that moral virtue “must be within the reach of anyone who really wants it.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">45</sup></button>   And, since she thinks wisdom is a moral virtue, she believes that wisdom must be within the reach of anyone who truly seeks it out. That is a lot of knowledge, in my opinion. Given the limitations of many human adults, we should note how we are forced to draw the line of ‘moral agency’ to fit the condition that moral virtue is ‘within reach of anyone’. Essentially, I question the magnitude of the word ‘anyone’, as it is likely more limited in this passage than many are willing to accept. For example, I believe my child has some degree of wisdom but not all wisdom is within her reach at this point. Still, I don’t want to discount her as some non-agent because she doesn’t meet the condition which Foot has set out. It seems better for an account of ethics to allow for degrees of moral responsibility that scale with intellectual capacity, and that doesn’t seem possible in Foot’s account.</p><p>Wisdom is part knowledge and part ‘will’, and so it seems as though wisdom is both an intellectual and a moral virtue. While many might wish to attack Foot’s conflation of desire with will, I don’t think I truly know enough about our minds to counter it. So, in charity, I’m going to assume that ‘desire’, insofar as I am responsible for it, and insofar as it affects what I intend, is something which I ‘will’. This, of course, is not an adequate account of ‘will’ entirely, but it is in keeping with the essential point that will is the capacity which enables our moral responsibility.</p><p>One realm where the relationship between emotions, desires, wisdom, will, and reason all collide is what it means for a virtuous person to have ‘moral motivation’ and its impact on the ‘moral worth’ or our assessment of an agent’s unit of moral experience. I think this isn’t such an easy topic. For example, on one hand we expect that choosing and performing virtuously should be obvious for the virtuous agent, but, in turn, we might somehow be less impressed in our assessment of the resulting decision/action because the virtuous agent seemed inclined to do what is virtuous, as if it were too easy, and didn’t really have to ‘work’ or exercise reason and autonomy (to a great extent) to be virtuous in that instance. One may be tempted to assess the moral worth of a decision/action by its relative difficulty for an agent to achieve. This may follow that adage, “to whom much is given, much is required.” We are tempted to have one set of expectations of the virtuous (because it is easy for them to do what is right) and another set of expectations of the unvirtuous (because it is so hard for them to do what is right); it is the temptation to judge the virtuous and unvirtuous differently, even for the same sort of act. The moral worth of doing what is virtuous for the unvirtuous is quite an accomplishment; it is the sort of moral and psychological experience we want to applaud above and beyond a virtuous person might experience in the same situation. Of course, the obvious retort to this temptation: if we mean by ‘moral motivation’ simply ‘what I desired’, and if struggling to be virtuous demonstrates that I don’t want what is morally right, then I as a person and my act simply aren’t as good as the virtuous agent and her act because she is gladly virtuous. </p><p>The role of reason in will is also exceptionally important here. Insofar as agents might be driven by animalistic desires or inclinations for which they can’t control in the moment, we may want to say (although it isn’t exactly clear where the virtue ethicist stands on this issue) then these agents aren’t performing actions of moral worth. If we performed the right action because we employed our reason within will, then it seems intuitively true that this is the sort of actions which can have moral worth. </p><p>Lastly, I don’t know to what extent wisdom is incorporated into each of the virtues and to what extent wisdom is unique and distinct from the other moral virtues. You are not supposed to claim ignorance in papers, but I honestly know neither how we should describe the landscape of the psychological crossroads of will, reason, and desire, nor exactly how wisdom (as a ‘fine-tuning’ process) relates to the other moral virtues. I want to recognize they are important questions, though.</p><p>In conclusion, I’m sympathetic to much of what Foot has to say. Moral virtues are exercised by the will. Wisdom is a moral virtue, and thus it is in some degree exercised by the will. Wisdom has cognitive value to interpreting, understanding, inferring, and applying the other moral virtues, and, in this sense, wisdom is of the intellect and reason. It seems as if we are responsible for choosing to perform moral reasoning, and, in this sense, wisdom is of the will. In the end, I’m led to believe that virtue ethics has the greatest need (of the various approaches) to understand and define the psychological nature of moral agents.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Rosalind Hursthouse, <em>On Virtue Ethics</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 47</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> Ibid., 46</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">3 : </span> Ibid., 46-47</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">4 : </span> Ibid., 47</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">5 : </span> Ibid., 47</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">6 : </span> Ibid., 47</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">7 : </span> Ibid., 48</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">8 : </span> Ibid., 76</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">9 : </span> Ibid., 50-51</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">10 : </span> Ibid., 51</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">11 : </span> Ibid., 51</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">12 : </span> Ibid., 63</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">13 : </span> Ibid., 71</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">14 : </span> Ibid., 72</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">15 : </span> Ibid., 74</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">16 : </span> Ibid., 70-71</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">17 : </span> Ibid., 72</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">18 : </span> Ibid., 73-74</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">19 : </span> Ibid., 74</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">20 : </span> Ibid., 79</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">21 : </span> Ibid., 79</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">22 : </span> Ibid., 82</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">23 : </span> Ibid., 81</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">24 : </span> Ibid., 81</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">25 : </span> Ibid., 78</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">26 : </span> Phillipa Foot, “Virtues and Vices” in <em>Virtue Ethics</em>, ed.
