<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I arrived early. They were boarding the first shuttle as I got out of the car. I had to wait for the second.</p><p>We sat. We had our meeting. David Mull is my mentor. Chester is his boss. And the head project manager above him I think.</p><p>David Mull and the welder gave us a tour of what we will be doing. It is a big job. Most of my tools are useless because it is a 42-inch pipe. Lol. I'm going to learn so fucking much. </p><p>We did a lot of standing around. Eventually, we got 36 bolts and nuts, 2 huge fucking wrenches for 2-3/8&quot;, and the flimsiest gasket ever.</p><p>I did the little stuff and the heavy lifting. I need to find ways to make myself useful to them.</p><p>We eventually got the two pieces of pipe fitted against each other. The gasket didn't want to go in. We used bolt butter. Took some jimmying to get the hilos right.</p><p>We then had a shitty conservative's presentation, yet again, but this time on Fall Safety. Important topic, awful presentation. </p><p>I confirmed I can wear one. Good. I prefer yo-yos/retractable.</p><p>When we got back I used a hammer drill with a &quot;jackhammer&quot; end on it to drill into and poke out a bunch of pavement around some pipes we'll be cutting and sealing off.</p><p>My boss, David, spoke to me as often as he did the journeyman (also named David). Interesting. He obviously wants to see what I can do. I'm still learning the ropes, and I walked into the office to talk to him since Alice said I should get the bottle from him. I'm sure I missed some political implication to it at some level here. I got some penetrant oil (forget what it was called, started with a C) to put on some bolts we needed to have removed. I think I am embarrassed myself, but I did not feel embarrassed (just worried). </p><p>I'm just going to keep doing my best. That impressed Tim, and this guy seems talented, like my teacher Tim. Obviously, the goal is to seek my own approval. However, I find it useful to care about what smart, talented people think. As long as they have the right personalities and values, along with the talent, I can and should try to see them as my mentor. I'm entering a world, and I need guidance. Those who reward merit, who aim for high standards, who are excellent at the practice, these are the people who I must learn from, study under, develop relationships with, etc. </p><p>Politically and socially, perhaps at multiple levels and ways, this is next to impossible. I'm fear I'm making a terrible first impression. I am not good with relationships. Eventually, they do not make sense to me, the corrupt, they fail. My wife and my brother JRE are perhaps the only exceptions thus far. </p><p>That said, I should do my best. Thinking through relationships and goals on this log is important. Use this wiki to explore the hardest parts of your job, to embrace the challenge, to find new ways to excel. Practice correctly. How else can you become a master?</p><p>What do I need to do?</p><ul><li>Get your rash fixed.</li><li>Write more in this wiki, particularly while high on cannabliss.<ul><li>You really do think more clearly on it. Why do you think you excelled so much in the first 3 months of the pipefitting program? You were happy, and that was in no small part due to cannabliss. While you accomplished a lot in the 3-month hiatus, you certainly weren't nearly as effective as you were the first 3 months. You were less motivated and thoughtful without it. You weren't creative or empathic enough off it. On it, you worked harder with a better lens towards the world.</li></ul></li><li>Start carrying your tools on you. <ul><li>Level, Tape measure, Notebook!, watch, marking utensils, </li></ul></li><li>You should dress for the job you want. Look sharp, even as a construction worker. You have to look smart but not preppy (don't wear, as I've heard it phrased, &quot;fuck me in the ass shoes&quot;). Look rugged, intelligent, and confident. Being handsome matters. You must fake it till you make it.<ul><li>These people are still just animals. They will respond to that virtue signaling. </li><li>You'll buy this stuff with your monthly work account. We will buy things for work. My wife needs to dress awesomely too.<ul><li>She has to make do with very little. This is part of her eccentric beauty. I legitimately believe I owe my wife so much more. I need to make more money to help her. I honestly believe money will make my wife happier. I need to do that without making huge sacrifices in my family life, and I can do that through maximum mobility.</li><li>Let's say $100 per month devoted to our vocations, whether for clothes, training, or tools. We should build, and budgeting is the way to do it. Let us not be frivolous with our money. The children can receive $50 a month as well.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Buylist:</p><ul><li><strike>Notebook</strike>, <strike>Watch</strike>, Leg Suspension Trauma Safety Straps</li><li>Nicer shirts. Keep the nice dark jeans + solid black boots. Just accept the vest; wear a comfortable one with useful pockets. This allows you to wear a decent shirt. </li></ul><p>Clearly, I'm engaged in social warfare. The redpill is strong. My goal in this competition is to find a long-term, safe job that provides me with enormous competence, networking, and job security. </p><p>I need to build a map of the hierarchy in my group at Yates.</p></div>
