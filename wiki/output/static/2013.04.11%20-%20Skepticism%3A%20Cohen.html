<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>First Proposal ‚Äì Lewis‚Äôs ‚ÄúRule of Accomodation‚Äù</p><p>‚Äúflat‚Äù is context sensitive, it requires a ‚Äúconversational score‚Äù</p><p>If I‚Äôve learned anything, it seems to me that it must be this: Knowledge is not the goal. We don‚Äôt what it is, what counts as it, when we have it, or even if we can have it. I do want to be able to assert things and consider the value of other peoples‚Äô assertions ‚Äì but, I‚Äôm willing to accept a lower epistemic standard. I guess I‚Äôm less interesting in scaling the standards of knowledge, I‚Äôm not sure that really works. I‚Äôm more interested in justified belief, which perhaps scales with the context.</p><p>Cohen</p><p>How do we know the correct standard for each context? My worry is that we could provide ad hoc accounts or that contextualism might struggle to overcome to charge relativism.</p><p>Why in the case of John and Mary vs. Smith do we need to take one of those three options? The problem is that we don't have to think of this as one monolithic context in which one party is wrong and the other is right, or they are both wrong. Why can't they both be right? John and Mary are in the same geographic location, probably from the same nation, they speak the same language, etc. as Smith. But, they have different values, goals, and beliefs in mind, and essentially, they stand in a different subcontext than Smith.</p><p>Obviously, such has to defend itself against the charge of relativism. I submit that certain versions of particularism in moral philosophy do not fall into relativism, even if they appear at first glance as if they do. I think a contextualist could be particularist as well without falling to relativism.</p><p>NM, that is where he went.</p><p>My worry about the standard of contextualism is that it may need to assume a universal standard of knowledge or justification which is context independent.</p><p>Why can't we say (e) or (f)? Yeah, it isn't how we normally speak or use the word, but maybe we should. Why must contextualism be tied to the language game? Perhaps ordinary language sparked our intuitions about contextualism, but they don't have to be so strongly linked from what I can tell.</p><p>Quick list of thoughts and concerns on Contextualism:</p></div>
