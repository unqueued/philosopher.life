TUE 9:24 AM
One of my favorite memories from college is being a freshman, hanging out in the dorm hallways with people, and debating what the definition of a game is; that discussion echoed through the following three years, and sidetracked its way into trying to define a &quot;role-playing game&quot; and so on. I don't think we ever arrived at much agreement - I think it's one of those words where different people will have strongly different opinions on what makes a game and what doesn't.
TUE 6:25 PM
AI just doesn't make moves that people would make -- and often, in Ascension's deckbuilding, a person will try to build a deck with a focus on a certain mechanic or faction where as far as I can tell the AI doesn't consider that at all. So then I'd play with a person and they wouldn't let me have the same cards that the AI does and my usual strategies fail lol
TUE 6:25 PM
Going infinite in Ascension has also really sold me on drawing cards...I've been playing //Shards of Infinity// recently, which is very similar to Ascension but fixes several of its issues in really elegant ways, and I always want to buy all the &quot;draw a card&quot; cards for my deck without stopping to think about whether or not it's the most optimal card to buy for my deck/strategy. XD
TUE 6:26 PM
Hm, yeah! &quot;Forming excellent principles&quot; is definitely a higher/greater part of being a good player, but it's supported by the memorization/recall of the cards. Example, my friends playing Hearthstone and with their knowledge of cards/decks, being able to play around potential board clear etc that the opponent might have. I suppose that's larger knowledge of the game state and tactics? But it also relies on that memorization of card text to know exactly what to work around. One builds on the other. :)
TUE 6:26 PM
I do think a lot of it is also that cards from a wide variety of games do //very// similar things, so some amount of card knowledge from one game transfers to the other. I keep calling cards in //Shards of Infinity// by their //Ascension// name, because it's essentially the same card text ahaha. Having that familiarity from Ascension also helps me think about the sort of strategies I can use cards with, simply because they do the same or very similar things.
TUE 6:26 PM
I think digital card games tried to break away the most from the mechanics of Magic &amp; physical card games, but I'm not sure they actually have. Rather, it seems to be the same principles just in a new medium with slightly different twists.
TUE 6:26 PM
Also, I want to apologize for taking such a long time to reply! I wanted to sit down and actually //reply// and it's hard to do so on my phone.

TUE 6:27 PM
happy new year to you too!! :D
TUE 6:27 PM
I think one of the things I liked most about 2018 is that I started doing things I wanted to do but had previously procrastinated or avoided doing &quot;because I didn't have time&quot;. I carved and printed 6 linoleum blocks and that's a //lot// compared to my (non-existent) previous output! Also lots of knitting this year. And taking classes! It was overall a really busy and good year. :)
TUE 6:37 PM
For 2019, I'm hoping find a new job, even if it takes ages. I don't mind my current job, but I'd really really like to get out of retail before the next holiday season...and into a job with actual benefits, though that might be a long shot. I also want to do way more bicycling than I did in 2018!
TUE 6:37 PM
Don't worry about the time on your reply. I'm very much enjoying your wiki posts too! =)
TUE 7:05 PM
If and when you have the time and inclination, I would love to know your opinion about the definition of the concept of a game. I can't say I have an answer I like. It's an important problem to me.
TUE 7:08 PM
I keep beating my head against the wall with it too (define: define...or the game is defining the game).
TUE 7:08 PM
You are correct, they build on each other. I will need to think about more it.
TUE 7:15 PM
I agree that knowledge of the games mechanics (Magic's rulebook is probably over 60 pages of definitions, theorems, and errata at this point) and cards is the basis for making particular moves. There is no game without us being able to hold the semantics of in our head (and having long-term memorized the cards makes it easy to recall and try variations of gamestates in our minds). I have seen people play fairly complex magic decks who didn't actually know the what their cards officially said all the way down, they had simply memorized the order of operations in playing the deck and understood enough about the gamestates and rules-of-thumb (even the judges of the oldest eternal formats do not know or understand some of the cards, but they can play the decks 98% of the time and understand the gist).
TUE 7:17 PM
2018 was super productive =)
TUE 7:19 PM
I'd like to see pics of the blocks when you get a chance.
TUE 7:20 PM
It might be a long shot (and I don't think that's your fault).
TUE 7:20 PM
I see you have been working on coding. Is that the direction you are thinking about going in 2019?
TUE 7:21 PM
I am working on responding to a lot of people, so my [[Seeking Sphygmus]] log is going slower than I'd like. One thing at a time, lol. Even if I'm not responding, I'm reading within a few minutes of you posting it usually.
