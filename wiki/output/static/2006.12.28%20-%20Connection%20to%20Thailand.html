<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Finally Mom and Dad got their internet connection! ‚Ä¶(there are actually a few things about the U.S. that are so much better than everything else in the world..although, maybe I‚Äôm just blind to the corruption in our own government and society.) Anyways, we got to talk to them for the first time in months, which was fantastic. They are doing well. It sounds like they are still adjusting to life in Thailand (and who wouldn‚Äôt be?).</p><p>k0sh3k made a fantastic potatoe soup (and she stuff potatoe skins too‚Ä¶which totally wtfpwnd). Highly recommend it.</p><p>Botting AV did not work last night. Damnit. I ran a macro from my n52 to my keyboard, a mouse macro, and the very bot itself‚Ä¶this was to make my character actually automatically join, enter, leave, and, more importantly, actually do something inside the BG itself. Being able to run around while inside lowers my chances of detection dramatically. But, alas, it didn‚Äôt work from what I can tell. I doubt I will try again =)‚Ä¶.</p><p>By the way, I‚Äôve re-written my Resume. Employment History now goes (zomg):</p><p>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</p><p>Medicare Billing Specialist     9/2006 - Present

Work closely with respective market offices and related departments, and manage cases with issues which require interdepartmental effort to complete. Communicate trends and problems between Medicare, Humana, and the customer. Often work one on one with customers over a long period of time to manage complex problems.</p><p>English Teacher and Arts &amp; Humanities Teacher  7/2005 - 8/2006

Managed and evaluated students both individually and corporately, provided due rewards and punishments, created incentive for students to put forth their maximum effort, and fashioned future course-plan structures fitting for what each student hoped to accomplish post-graduation. Maintained detailed records, keeping in constant contact with parents/guardians of 90 students at a time. Worked with multiple teachers and departments to develop course curriculum, prepared goals and direction for our school and departments, and formed action plans fit for the individual student‚Äôs needs.</p><p>Teacher‚Äôs Assistant      8/2004 - 5/2005

Provided a musical complement and performed for a variety of services, both weekly and special occasions.  Held practices for instrumentalists, music team, and the choir.</p><p>Crew Person and Store Closer    8/2001 - 7/2003
[Redacted]
Operated the restaurant, including cooking, cleaning, customer service, basic financial responsibilities and bookkeeping, and closing the store each night. Also maintained flexible shifts schedules.</p><p>So sad. Well, time to tweak it and start applying to more jobs. Formatting was never my thing. But, we‚Äôll get it done. I‚Äôve found a few to apply for‚Ä¶although, it annoys me greatly how slow this process of finding another job can go.I just know that driving 2-3 hours a day, on top of mandatory overtime, means I‚Äôm away from the house 11-13 hours of the day‚Ä¶all for 30-40k? Couldn‚Äôt I make 30-40k in E-town‚Ä¶boom, less travel expenses (including, time traveled, which is an expense when you get down to calculating actual costs), and thus more time for me to be at home.</p><p>To me, what is most ironic is that I‚Äôm the smartest person in this building (and at least a couple thousand work here), and yet I‚Äôll never do what it takes to rise above these people economically, or in any way climb the ladder‚Ä¶why? Because they sell their souls when they work here. Even for those who haven‚Äôt done anything we would consider ‚Äúexplicity‚Äù evil‚Ä¶most everyone here just sells their soul. You might not see it, but eh, you are a blind (no offense to the zero people that actually read this paragraph of course). People here still don‚Äôt see what is important (not that I have it down perfectly, but I‚Äôve got a pretty freakin‚Äô good idea, or atleast I‚Äôm headed in the right direction‚Ä¶unlike the people around me). All I know: I want to make enough to provide for my family, save a little bit, and thats it‚Ä¶the rest of my time is more valuable to me spent at home with my family. People are work-crazy. Why can‚Äôt they just understand this job for what it is: a source of income, not a purpose.</p><p>And, hell yes I compartmentalize my life. Work stays at work, home at home. This gives me true power of their priority and status. Work is a mere complication in my homelife, not an actual integral part of who I am; it is that which does not interfere with what is important or personal to me. I treat it like a foreign object. Do I want this? No. But, until I get a job that reflects whatever I‚Äôm actually supposed to be doing in this world, then no, I‚Äôm waiting and prodding that foreign object, begrudgingly fulfilling the oh-so-important duties they think they have me do. In all honesty, I am mentally prepared to drop whatever I‚Äôm doing and go where God tells me to (not that He would ever speak to me directly). This is what really seperates me from the herd (not that I really needed any more seperation‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôve spaced it out myself quite nicely so far).</p><p>I must admit, everyday I get the feeling I have lived a full life, even if, ironically, I am tormented by the fact that I haven‚Äôt fulfilled my purpose (if I have one besides just sitting here thinking about my purpose). It is the case that I have done more so far than most do in a lifetime. I have no room to complain at all; I am blessed (I don‚Äôt believe in luck after all). Each day is gravy.</p><p>Well, that‚Äôs all for this installment of what I‚Äôm thinking about in my first half an hour at work!‚Ä¶see you next time for: ‚ÄúWhy I love going number 2, and solving all the mysteries of life in 6 seperate 2-minute squeezes.‚Äù</p></div>
