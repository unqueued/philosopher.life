<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>It's starting to hurt his eye now. It sounds miserable for eating and even just the social parts of not grossing others out. He needs an eyepatch that pressures the lid down, but he couldn't get one (yet?). He has basically no control over that side of his face, uses eyedrops, and may be living through this for months (85% recovery rate...).</p><p>My brother has been engaging in some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Stoicism-fu.html">Stoicism-fu</a>. I can tell. Several kinds of inferences demonstrate it to me. He is thinking about what it means to have a good day carefully.</p><p>He has found a way to play with his cat without getting hurt.</p><p>Our donors sent him an e-mail with a guilt-trip. </p><p>My brother had a rougher day last Friday than I knew. He told me about losing face even when he wasn't at fault (my brother is the sort who is quick to point out his faults). </p><p>We talked about why many people don't enjoy talking to me, lol.</p><p>My brother still wants a solution/replacement to Capitalism, and unfortunately, I cannot give him a vision of the result (I suggest nobody can see it all). I only have a method. I don't know what the end result looks like. I can't see that far. I am convinced <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> is the basic algorithm, and making sure altruists get the most bang for the buck might also be a form of that. This Robustness Principle has also been called (ironically not robust on the following view) Antifragility too.</p><p>My brother suggested I be the anti-<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Ayn%2520Rand.html">Ayn Rand</a> fiction writer. I will continue to think about it. Thought experiments I can see, but some kinds of philosophical ideas aren't easy to directly write fiction about. Truth is all too often boring or painful. Furthermore, I can barely even say it in plain English. Fiction requires many more levels of mastery, imho. My brother gave me another 7 minutes to talk about it. I appreciate his patience.</p></div>
