<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>In economics, which is really a study of power and why people do what they do, the theory of comparative advantage explains why it can be beneficial for two parties (countries, regions, individuals, ...) to trade, even though one of them may be able to produce every kind of item more cheaply than the other. What matters is not the absolute cost of production, but rather the ratio between how easily the two countries can produce different goods. The concept is highly important in modern international trade theory.</p><p>Comparative advantage may be compared (haha) to absolute advantage. When one entity (be it a company or a country) is able to produce more efficiently than another entity it has an absolute advantage: that is, assuming equal inputs, the entity with an absolute advantage will have a greater output.</p><p>At the core of the theory is the idea that one√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s economic interest lay producing what one has a ratio-based advantage in producing. Those who are more efficient at producing X, should produce lots of X, and uses excesses of X to trade for the excesses of those who have comparative advantages producing Y and Z. Albeit, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not one who believes in excess. But!, I do think that as long as the excess is used for the greater good, and spread across those who DO need, then we have much better justification for producing, at least in the little picture, excess. Excess beyond the sum of all need, including preparation and savings, is not a good thing. Luckily, comparative advantage can still be applied in smaller settings, as the excesses can overflow to places that don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the same producting.</p><p>I always loved the idea of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcomparative advantage.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù The very nature of it is concerned with efficiency and giving to the community the products of your specific and maybe unique talents. In fact, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve grown accustomed to this concept; you could say I am fond of it because it has moral implications. It defines and lays the groundwork for brief and practical existential claims.</p><p>Do what you were made to do, use your gifts to preserve and develop yourself and the people around you! This is economical design, the efficiency of God√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s creation, and an aspect of beauty rarely recognized within the church.</p><p>Usually, we think of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGifts√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in an extremely narrow sense. Gifts of the Spirit aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t necessarily spiritual in nature. Rather, those gifts are used FOR the Spirit, maybe given by Spirit, and maybe we are motivated by the Spirit to use those gifts. But, these gifts range and vary greatly, equivalently with the number and variety of purposes predicated of all people.</p><p>Who isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happy using their gifts for the right reasons? Purpose people, PURPOSE! We are fulfilled in the execution and completion of our duties, and clearly our duties have to do with the gifts bestowed to us. Those gifts give us a comparative advantage. Thinking in terms of comparative advantage, and truly applying it, would be quite utopian.</p></div>
