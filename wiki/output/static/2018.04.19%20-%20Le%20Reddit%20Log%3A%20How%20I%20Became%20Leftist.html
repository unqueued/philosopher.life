<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/8dhj3c/how_did_people_here_come_to_the_left_for_me_it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/8dhj3c/how_did_people_here_come_to_the_left_for_me_it/</a></p><p>I'm the son of two highly educated evangelical/fundamentalist pastors (that sounds like an oxymoron, but it isn't in this case) with non-trivial 3rd-wave feminist injections in our belief system. I grew up studying the Bible and theology in a way that most children (and even most adults) did not. Jesus was obviously a socialist, but we weren't permitted to say it. I took his words very seriously. We were, of course, allergic to communism. In addition to our social circles and educational institutions, for those familiar with St. Paul's work, you can see why we could be brainwashed into our cognitive dissonance.</p><p>I've been a greyhat computer addict since I was 12. I have what may appear to be Libertarian tendencies, particularly regarding rights to information, privacy, and anonymity. My reading in cryptography, intellectual property, dystopian literature, and American intelligence history served to reinforce Leftism in me.</p><p>While I performed well in my Chicago-style economics classes, I always had a serious problem with their philosophical foundations (which is partly why I became a philosophy major). I worked as a teacher, as a programmer/analyst for a major insurance company, missions work, then as a university instructor. I kept searching (and I still am). As an autistic person (who didn't know he was autistic until much later in life), I just couldn't understand the motivations and theories of minds of the people around me. Leftism, however, has consistently made more and more sense to me each passing year.</p><p>I voted for Obama the first time around, but within a year, I regretted it. I've been pretty disillusioned since then. It has taken me a while to see what is Left of the Democrats. When I saw the DNC do everything in their power to prevent Bernie from winning the primaries and predicted Trump's win, I became militant.</p><p>Over the decades, I shed my conservativisms, my faith, and my church affiliations. I always knew this world was fucked up, but it took me far too long to realize I had been systematically told lies for most of my life. My years of graduate work in philosophy was a painful process of throwing off dogmatic yokes. I currently work for trade unions, and reading about the history of unions has been wonderfully inspiring to me. I consider myself lucky to be alive and pleased to count myself as a Leftist. </p></div>
