<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Bah! There comes a point where a good deontologist simply has a very hard time partaking of any aspect of life. We become passive, even though we aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t neutral. </p><p>How could I possibly explain what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thinking to others? How could I possibly walk through the argument, especially for those issues which to most people don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even seem to warrant a discussion in such a direction? </p><p>I seem dead. But, I am not. I am fully aware, and fully here. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t participate because I cannot. I am standing by my principles√¢‚Ç¨¬¶and in large part I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be disciplined and forthcoming at the same time.</p><p>Why be reclusive? Because the world is crazy! They are stupid. They are wrong. They are too ignorant to be enlightened. Ivory tower, no. Protection from the world is all I seek. </p><p>Everyday I am sucked into it, and I climb out√¢‚Ç¨¬¶I escape. Escape to principles and truthseeking. Escape to thought. I Escape to Reality.</p><p>Some days I feel like the smartest person in the world. Other days, especially when reading history, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel like that at all. A lot of brilliant people lived. A lot of amazing things have been accomplished. There are people who can do things I can not√¢‚Ç¨¬¶and vice versa. It is a little of both.</p><p>Do well with what you are given. Arrive at the Will of God. The means to this goal, and attaining a resembling will is all that matters. This is enlightenment. Whether you are brilliant in mathematics, art, physics, reading√¢‚Ç¨¬¶what have you, these only HELP to get you to that end goal. They are important, yes√¢‚Ç¨¬¶almost exclusively insofar as they help on to reach that goal.</p><p>I think my gifts aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t easy to point out. I think mine are judging fairness/justice and redefining concepts, adjusting what they should mean to reflect reality (I.E. judging and interpreting). Now, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not saying I use or apply these perfectly. But, it is clear that I have a wealth of insight in whatever I do (with the ironic exception of my own life!).</p><p>While I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have √¢‚Ç¨≈ìobvious√¢‚Ç¨¬ù direction in my life, I choose VERY carefully. I am wrong sometimes, but rarely. I know what I know, and I am in my element dealing with the abstract. Combined with my distaste for so many things, it makes it difficult for me to be of use to the world. Maybe God placed me here to just be here to think about this sort of thing (would He have use for that?....surely He would want someone searching out and praising His brilliance!)</p><p>I have that hidden fear I will never contribute to the world. I bring myself back and realize that I√Ç exist for my family and for God....I know that I may just be one of the smartest Janitors on the planet. The world needs smart janitors. </p><p>Seek God.</p><p>God has granted me wisdom in many ways. I need the patience and will to use my gifts.</p><p>While I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m certainly a passionate person, I feel choked as a√¢‚Ç¨¬¶computer. God has granted the knowledge, but not the ability to communicate or use it effectively. Ironic.</p><p>I think my tattoo is superb. It holds my deepest belief and desire.</p><p>I know I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t belong here. It can suck to be√¢‚Ç¨¬¶.different, you know? I need a light for my path. (Who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t?)√¢‚Ç¨¬¶You know the feeling, the intuitive tug√¢‚Ç¨¬¶the immediate reaction when you have stumbled upon what IS right and what is fit for your purpose. My wife was this, my major was that, my deepest sorrow for the innocent and a pursuit of knowledge (and its distribution!) must be as well. </p><p>(Wow, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve blathered on√¢‚Ç¨¬¶structure people, structure!)</p><p>&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&amp;quot&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&amp;quot&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&amp;quot&lt;span /&gt;</p><p>&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&amp;quot</p></div>
