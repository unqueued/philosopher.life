<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I've written several times on this idea of Value. For some reason, I've always had a disconnect, and never universally applied this concept. It is elegant and foundational. I've long thought about how one deductively arrives at &quot;what one ought to do&quot; and the existence of God. Inevitably, there are complications, and further building blocks that I must reason through. Epistemological and metaethical concerns are so germane to the problem that we can't move on without first going through those small, but highly relevant claims. The beauty of these building blocks is that they really beg the question for us (something I'm not usually for). Without initially accepting the concepts of value and logic, then there is no point to continue. By assuming these are true, we make way, in virtue of the question-begging, for deductive claims that are much easier to establish, even within a world that more and more wishes to remain &quot;secular&quot; and apart of &quot;value and logic judgments&quot;. Value and logic must be universally applied; after all, they are the foundation. They solve our complications, and they are the first step in our deduction. It knocks out nay-saying post-moderns and relativists. We have a base to work from‚Äìone that is the root all others things. It connects so beautifully with all other deductions in the chain. It is the filter by which we can have truth and meaning.√Ç So, I'm glad to have a solid starting point in my isolation and application of value. It knocks out most all of the arguments that are against us. You are either for value and logic, or you have nothing to say. The synthesis (and adjusts to be made) of all possible values into a single and universal value gives us leverage. There is no difference between moral value, economic value, and whatever else. There is one value to consider. Is it worth pursuing, and how much is it worth (pursuing)? s</p><p>While this doesn't seem like headway to most people (if they even saw the distinction I'm talking about), it really is...Not a person I know really applies these meaning universally. They don't breathe the concepts of value and logic, nor do they extend and consider their meanings in all situations. This is a common disconnect; and I do find that at some level, we are all guilty of betraying the system. We have a rock-solid starting place. It is quick and obviously true; it separates the wheat from the obvious chaff immediately. I am pleased.&amp;</p><p>This means that our starting foundation is Utilitarian in nature. What is &quot;useful&quot; is simply pursuing that which is most worth pursuing. But, wait...&quot;pursuing that which is most useful&quot; is a principle. Mmm...Deontology and Teleology may co-exist in this context. By following the original principle, one can implement utilitarian deductions. But, the deductions made follow that &quot;rule-utility&quot;. While most rule-utilitarians would not want to place value in the &quot;rules&quot; themselves, clearly the very path by which you must choose has the most value in and of itself. The rule is valuable. The principle remains. We have the makings of our next step (which must be drawn out), the synthesis of teleology and deontology. We cannot accept that damn triangular approach to ethics. There is only one way.
