<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>In this paper, I will define lying, explicate Kant‚Äôs position on it, and explain two major justifications for that position. I will offer a criticism of Kant‚Äôs position and a solution to the larger problem the issue of lying presents us. </p><p>What is ‚Äúlying‚Äù to Kant? Kant distinguishes truth and truthfulness.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> Declaring truth is not always up to us (we are epistemically fallible); being truthful, which is more of an attitude or intention, however, is up to us. Intentional deception and untruthfulness sit at the heart of the act of lying.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> A lie is an intentional declaration of what one believes to be an untrue statement.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button></p><p>What is Kant‚Äôs position on lying? He seems to have legal and moral positions. I‚Äôm going to quickly gloss over Kant‚Äôs concerns on the legal status and implications of lying (although they are interesting) and focus on the moral position instead, since the moral position completely overshadows the legal in this case.</p><p>Initially, it seems as though Kant generally isn‚Äôt against lying in the legal realm. As long as one doesn‚Äôt violate another‚Äôs external right or harm another person, such as offering ‚Äúthe false allegation that a contract has been concluded with someone, made in order to deprive him of what is his,‚Äù then Kant might appear fairly relaxed, in a legal context, as to whether or not one lies, as it is ‚Äúentirely up to them [those who hear the truth or lie] whether they want to believe him or not.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> However, Kant says, ‚Äúa lie, defined merely as an intentionally untrue declaration to another‚Ä¶must harm another‚Ä¶For it always harms another, even if not another individual, nevertheless humanity generally, inasmuch as it makes the source of right unusuable.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> From what I can tell, this could possibly stand as both a legal and moral reason to never lie. Further, Kant worries about the legal responsibilities (of the liar) which result from someone acting upon a lie told to them.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button> </p><p>Ultimately, I‚Äôm not sure if Kant‚Äôs position on the legal aspects of lying is all that pertinent in light of his ethical stance on this issue. In the ethical realm, the realm with highest normative priority (it is unclear to me that any other realm, including the legal, has any independent normativity), Kant claims lying is always wrong. He declares this in many passages; we‚Äôll cover a couple of them to get a picture of how he views lying.</p><p>Kant uses the obligation not to lie as an example of a law with absolute necessity in the Groundwork: ‚Äúthe command ‚Äòthou shalt not lie‚Äô does not hold only for human beings,‚Äù but for all rational beings.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> Continuing that Biblical position, Kant remarks, ‚Äúthe Bible dates the first crime‚Ä¶not from fratricide (Cain‚Äôs) but from the first lie‚Ä¶and calls the author of all evil a liar from the beginning and the father of lies.‚Äù</p><p>In the Groundwork, Kant provides us the case of the lying promise, claiming it is morally wrong to lie (I‚Äôm saving the exegesis of this passage for my section on Kant‚Äôs justification).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button> </p><p>In the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant unequivocally declares with vehemence:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The greatest violation of a human being‚Äôs duty to himself regarded merely as a moral being (the humanity in his own person) is the contrary of truthfulness, lying‚Ä¶For, the dishonor (being an object of moral contempt) that accompanies a lie also accompanies a liar like his shadow‚Ä¶By an external lie a human being makes himself an object of contempt in the eyes of others; by an internal lie he does what is still worse: he makes himself contemptible in his own eyes and violates‚Ä¶[and]‚Ä¶annihilates his dignity as a human being. A human being who does not himself believe what he tells another‚Ä¶has even less worth than if he were a mere thing‚Ä¶such a speaker is a mere deceptive appearance of a human being, not a human being himself.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>Kant hates lying, and he takes it to be a far more serious offense than does the average person.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button> Lying is dehumanizing. His harsh words not only rebuke lying, but even one who ‚Äúasks permission to think about possible exceptions [to the exceptionless law against lying] is already a liar.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button> It is crystal clear to Kant that lying is always, in all cases and without exception, morally wrong. This is perhaps an unintuitive, extreme, and problematic position to many folk.</p><p>Kant is obviously quite serious about universal, exceptionless, necessary moral obligation. He even maintains his view in the face of a very compelling case of lying to the murderer at the door to save an innocent victim. Ultimately, he rebukes lying even in this case, and he responds: ‚ÄúTo be truthful (honest) in all declarations is therefore a sacred command of reason prescribing unconditionally, one not to be restricted by any conveniences.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button> That some innocent person may be murdered because you were truthful is not your fault, it is an accident that your truthfulness had this result.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">13</sup></button> Again, this may be going against a number of our intuitions, we may not find this position acceptable, but it is Kant‚Äôs expressed view of lying, even in hard circumstances.</p><p>What is Kant‚Äôs justification for the claim that all lying is morally wrong? In isolating and explicating Kant‚Äôs position on lying, I‚Äôve inadvertently had to allow some of his justification for this position to bleed through. Obviously, moral obligations can only be justified, in Kant‚Äôs theory, by the Categorical Imperative (CI). The CI is the sole arbitration and justification mechanism for the generation of all concrete duties, including the duties ‚Äúto never lie‚Äù or ‚Äúto always be truthful‚Äù (or however it is best phrased).
I‚Äôm going to consider two formulations of the CI. Each formulation seems to offer a different kind of justification for the duty to never lie.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">14</sup></button> Since we‚Äôve already seen a sneak peak of it, let‚Äôs first consider the Formula of Humanity, ‚ÄúSo act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">15</sup></button> As we‚Äôve seen, Kant thinks lying is dehumanizing to you, to the person the person to whom you are lying, and to humanity in general, a violation of this formula. In the case of lying to the murderer, from this formula, Kant believes we are treating the murderer, via lying, as merely a means (to saving the innocent life) and not as an end. As we read before, all lying is like this on Kant‚Äôs view, and hence this formulation is used as one of Kant‚Äôs justifications for the claim that all lying is morally wrong.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">16</sup></button></p><p>Consider the second formulation, the Formula of the Law of Nature, ‚ÄúAct as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">17</sup></button> He gives us a few applications of this formula, including the lying promise example. He explains:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I ask myself: would I indeed be content that my maxim (to get myself out of difficulties by a false promise) should hold as a universal law‚Ä¶? And could I indeed say to myself that every one may make a false promise when he finds himself in a difficulty he can get out of in no other way? Then I soon become aware that I could indeed will the lie, but by no means a universal law to lie; for in accordance with such a law there would properly be no promises at all, since it would be futile to avow my will with regard to my future actions to other who would not believe this avowal‚Ä¶.and thus my maxim, as soon as it were made a universal law, would have to destroy itself.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">18</sup></button>
</p></blockquote><p>A maxim with lying, in this case, couldn‚Äôt be (and maintain being) universalized, and hence lying is not permissible. Even in the case of the murderer, Kant would argue from this formulation something along the lines of: if everyone lied, then lying wouldn‚Äôt succeed in deceiving a murderer because the murderer wouldn‚Äôt believe what anyone had to say. Apparently, one can never will a maxim of lying to be universal law, and thus this formulation justifies the position that lying is never permitted and always wrong.</p><p>Is Kant correct? I fear not. My criticism will be brief. If the CI generates duties which wildly conflict with our intuitions, then perhaps the CI and the duties it generates are not justified. The case of lying to the murderer at your doorstep is a great example of where many of our moral intuitions contradict the unequivocal duty not to lie. Surely Kant has to be wrong about that, it is so obviously incorrect. In the same way that it is intuitively obvious that torturing babies is morally wrong, it is intuitively obvious that it is morally permissible (if not obligatory) to lie to the murderer at your doorstep.</p><p>Kant would respond to my criticism by pointing out that intuitions are contingent, and they cannot serve as the foundational grounds upon which to assess normative theories. I‚Äôm not sure on the matter; both directions are compelling to me (I fear I rely on intuition in figuring out whether or not I should rely upon intuition). I don‚Äôt know if we can salvage everything in Kant‚Äôs theory, and I see our project as being one of figuring out which parts of the theory we need as they are, which parts we must adjust, and which parts we must amputate to save the rest. I think there is a way to adjust Kant‚Äôs theory which can pacify and satisfy the intuition-based worry in the case of lying to the murderer without destroying the necessity, universality, and exceptionlessness at the heart of Kant‚Äôs ethics.</p><p>I think the best solution is to particularize maxims to some degree.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">19</sup></button> Maxims which are informationally enriched (specifying contexts, actions, and intentions to some extent) appear to be universalizable in cases where general maxims fail the test. An enriched maxim could pass the universality test; it would be necessary, unconditional, and exceptionless. It would apply to everyone, but it would only be needed in some circumstances.</p><p>Kant wouldn‚Äôt want to do this.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">20</sup></button> The parameters of maxim creation are a matter of debate, and I know my suggested solution will make any Kantian purist cringe. Again, I think Kant‚Äôs boat is sinking, and something drastic has to be done to fix it. In order to save the theory at large, we have to jettison Kant‚Äôs parameters on maxims, and that‚Äôs okay. The results are worthwhile, and they will match our moral intuitions and experience better.</p><p>Enriched, somewhat particularized maxims better capture the complexity of moral life; such maxims are tailored to the morally salient features of circumstances in a way that overly general maxims cannot admit or appreciate. That was the problem with general maxims in the first place. A number of the ‚Äúhard cases‚Äù which our moral intuitions raise against Kant‚Äôs theory can solved by providing details in maxims ‚Äì that this approach pacifies and complements our intuitions shows that this approach should not be dismissed out of hand. Lying maxims which are specified enough do seem universalizable, without contradiction or inconceivability. The reason nearly everyone thinks we should lie to the murderer at the doorstep is because we‚Äôve already universalized that enriched maxim ‚Äì that‚Äôs what our intuition captures.</p><p>Of course, this solution generates many questions. How particular could maxims be? Why? Isn‚Äôt it likely that particularized duties will lack the ‚Äúbite‚Äù we‚Äôve come to expect from general duties? I don‚Äôt know how best to respond to these kinds of problems. </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> 8:426</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> Admittedly, I can‚Äôt seem to uncover Kant‚Äôs definitive position on deceptive communication which may or may not explicitly qualify as lying (e.g. deception through omission, implicit misdirection, misuse of body language).

Depending on our language, it is possible to exclusively deduce different (yet not contradictory) conclusions from two equivalent propositions given the rules of inference. For example, we could have the following propositions: ~P v ~Q; ~(P &amp; Q); ~(P &amp; Q) -&gt; A;  (~P v ~Q) -&gt; B. Clearly, the first two are logically equivalent (as the formulas of the CI might be), and depending on the rules of inference in our language, we might only be able to arrive at proposition B from ~P v ~Q and (~P v ~Q) -&gt; B, and likewise, we might only be able to arrive at A from ~(P &amp; Q) and ~(P &amp; Q) -&gt; A. Perhaps to get B from ~(P &amp; Q) in our language, we might have to first convert ~(P &amp; Q) to ~P v ~Q, and only then we could get B. Just because the two formulations arrive at different (as long as they aren‚Äôt competing) conclusions, justifications in our analogy, doesn‚Äôt mean there is a problem. </sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">15 : </span> 4:429</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">16 : </span> I have so many worries about the moves he makes in this argument.
