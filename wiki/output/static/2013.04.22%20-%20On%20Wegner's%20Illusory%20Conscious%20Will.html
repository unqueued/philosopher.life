<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><strong>1 - Introduction</strong></p><p>In this paper, I will analyze Daniel Wegner‚Äôs view on the conscious will as presented primarily in the article ‚ÄúApparent Mental Causation: Sources of the Experience of Will‚Äù and a couple claims from his book The Illusion of Conscious Will. The second section is devoted to explicating Wegner‚Äôs view and work. His work in psychology seems to have upset (parts of) the philosophical world ‚Äì his conclusion is pretty staggering. Afterwards, in the third section, I‚Äôll briefly consider why his argument matters, its implications, and what we will lose if he is right. Finally, in the fourth section, I offer four criticisms of his argument. In particular, I am worried about the burden of proof in this dialectic, the problematic assumption that conscious will is a feeling, what conclusions the empirical evidence really supports, and the lack of evolutionary explanations for an illusory conscious will. </p><p><strong>2 - Wegner‚Äôs View</strong></p><p>Daniel Wegner argues the conscious will isn‚Äôt the cause of action.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> On his view, people everywhere mistakenly interpret their conscious thoughts as being causally relevant to their actions. In his writing, he attempts to dismantle the commonly held belief and experience of a direct causal connection between one‚Äôs conscious thoughts and actions. Ultimately, he believes the conscious will is epiphenomenal. </p><p>Wegner describes conscious will as an experience, feeling, or perception.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> The experience of conscious will spans from a conscious thought or intention to the appearance of a causal path to the target action.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> In Wegner‚Äôs view, the supposed causal link between the conscious thought and the action is illusory, and he claims both thought and action are caused by unconscious mechanisms.</p><p>Why are we mistaken? Why do we wrongfully interpret our experiences and erroneously infer causation?  Sometimes we perceive patterns and causation where there are none, and Wegner seems to think this is the case with the conscious will. Our flawed ability to recognize causation seems to be a significant reason why we have the experience of conscious will at all.  When conscious thoughts or intentions precede and match the target action in a timely, exclusive, compatible, and consistent manner, we mistakenly infer, via our flawed causal recognition, that our conscious will was the cause of the action. </p><p>Wegner thinks a potential link between thought and action is weakened by the involuntary nature of examples such as motor automatisms, hypnosis, dowsing, action projection, and psychological disorders such as schizophrenia, where in these cases one does not experience conscious will but still demonstrates many of the scientific signs of it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> In these cases, the person acting does not feel he is making a conscious decision to act, but feels as though some external force is causing the action through him ‚Äì that is, there is a separation between the action taken by the person and his conscious thought or desires; the link between conscious thought and action isn‚Äôt there when we would expect it to be. Further, Wegner uses an experiment, the ‚ÄúI Spy‚Äù study, to demonstrate how the experience of conscious will can be artificially created. Wegner‚Äôs experiment seems to build off and extend from Libet‚Äôs studies, which attempted to reveal how unconscious mechanisms played a major causal role in the appearance of voluntary action.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> Wegner employs both positions as evidence for the thesis that the experience of conscious will is an illusion, where conscious thoughts are inefficacious and do not cause our actions (despite all appearances).</p><p>The purpose of the ‚ÄúI Spy‚Äù study was to ‚Äúlead people to experience willful action when in fact they have done nothing.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button> This was a digital 2-player Ouiji board version of I Spy (using a mouse), where the participant was primed with words about items on the screen, forced onto certain objects by a confederate, and required to ‚Äúrate each stop they made for personal intentionality.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> The point of the study was to generate cases where participants artificially felt as though they consciously willed an action, when in fact, they did not cause the action. Word priming ‚Äúdid not cause participants to stop on the items.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button> Word priming did, however, conjure thoughts about the related objects on the screen, and when forced upon these objects in brief time frames after priming (1 or 5 seconds), participants ‚Äúreported having performed this movement intentionally.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button>
 
The experiment shows that one can have conscious thoughts which don‚Äôt cause action yet still form the illusion of an experience of conscious will. The involuntary examples demonstrate that one can have conscious thoughts which meet many of the matching parameters of target actions, but don‚Äôt result in the experience of conscious will. Together, both positions, in Wegner‚Äôs view, demonstrate how the apparent causal link between consciousness and action is an illusion.
Wegner claims the experience of conscious will serves to provide us a preview of what we may do, but ‚Äúthe real causal mechanisms underlying behavior are never present in consciousness. Rather, the engines of causation are unconscious mechanisms of mind.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button> It remains unclear why this ability to preview matters. </p><p><strong>3 ‚Äì A Couple Implications. What‚Äôs at Stake?</strong></p><p>If Wegner, like many psychologists, is right in thinking the conscious will can be reduced to deterministic, physical mechanisms, then the game is likely over for incompatibilists. We might initially think science is the wrong domain for proving we don‚Äôt have free will (which requires substantial metaphysics). Presumably, free will is part of having conscious will. If the experience of conscious will can be entirely reduced to mere physical mechanisms, if this phenomenon is best explained in naturalistic terms, then either incompatibilists should deny free agency or the burden of proof seems to be shifted to the libertarian.</p><p>Compatibilists (and incompatibilists as well) remain vulnerable to Wegner‚Äôs argument in a different way. If Wegner is right in thinking that conscious will is entirely an illusion, and if conscious thought does not cause action, then it is very hard to see how humans could engage in any sort of meaningful deliberation and choice necessary (even by compatibilist standards) for being moral agents. In essence, Wegner‚Äôs argument seems to reduce us down to mere observers of the results of our unconscious mechanisms. If he is right, then I don‚Äôt see why morality and moral responsibility should have any rational relevance to us. We can‚Äôt actually participate in moral life; moral life is an illusion. </p><p><strong>4 ‚Äì A Series of Brief Criticisms of Wegner‚Äôs View</strong></p><p><strong>4.1 ‚Äì Burden of Proof</strong></p><p>While Wegner tries to demonstrate why we can be mistaken in attributing causality, he does not ultimately show why we all feel like free agents. He must explain why this feeling of free agency, a very potent and convincing experience we all have, must be false, and particularly how and why we all suffer from this mass delusion. He seems to act as though he has an open-and-shut case against the efficacious conscious will (most of us are sometimes guilty of this sort of bravado). While he raises problems and concerns, he fails to provide the sort of extraordinary evidence required to counter almost everyone‚Äôs experience of this phenomenon and the intuitions we have on the matter. I think he has, at best, opened the door to the possibility that the conscious will is merely an illusion, but he has not convincingly closed the doors on the other possibilities. </p><p><strong>4.2 ‚Äì Conscious Willing as a Feeling</strong></p><p>Wegner claims that ‚Äú[w]ill is a feeling, not unlike happiness or sadness or anger or anxiety or disgust‚Ä¶ will has other characteristics of emotion, including an experiential component (how it feels), a cognitive component (what it means and the thoughts it brings to mind), and a physiological component (how the body responds).‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button> He is sympathetic to a scientific Humean view. Unfortunately, Wegner seems too quick to reduce the conscious will to some mental state of lower status; he glosses over our ordinary, everyday phenomenological evidence.</p><p>Quite related to my previous criticism, I fear that Wegner does not adequately capture or describe the phenomenon of conscious willing when he categorizes the will as a feeling. I grant that the conscious will is similar to feelings and sensory perception in salient ways. I don‚Äôt think, however, the experience of conscious willing is either an outright feeling or ultimately analogous to our ordinary feelings. It is more than that. When I attend to the phenomenon of my conscious will, it is not presented to me in a way similar to my ordinary feelings (admittedly, I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but I know what it does not appear like). I find the experience of the conscious will to be fantastically unique and far richer than something like sadness, anger, or happiness.  I may not be able to describe why exactly they differ, but Wegner also has not adequately explained away the experience of conscious willing as just another emotion or feeling. </p><p><strong>4.3 ‚Äì What Does His Evidence Support? </strong></p><p>We might also have methodological worries and issues dealing with what Wegner‚Äôs experiment really proves or explains. Wegner may be overstating what his evidence supports. A more conservative appraisal of the evidence suggests a different conclusion: we are fallible about our experience of conscious will. This is far from the bold thesis that conscious will is an illusion. Just because some experiences are illusory doesn‚Äôt mean all are illusory. Just because someone can be tricked into incorrectly believing he caused a cursor to stop on a screen (when in fact, another agent caused it), doesn‚Äôt mean that the experience of willing is always an illusion.</p><p>Looking specifically at the ‚ÄúI Spy‚Äù study, the situation seems contrived ‚Äì that is, the experiment seems more like a trick than the sort of study from which to draw such sweeping conclusions about the experience of conscious will in general. Why should we think this study is representative of the ordinary sort of experiences of conscious willing? This study seems to suffer some of the same problems that its predecessor, Libet‚Äôs study, encountered. It isn‚Äôt clear that these studies are examining normal conscious intentions, but rather automatic functions, rationalizations, or tricks that merely demonstrate our fallibility.</p><p>In addition, I‚Äôm not convinced the involuntary examples prove much of anything. They simply aren‚Äôt good examples of normal mental activity. Pathological conditions may (or may not) serve to show quirks and boundaries of the experience of conscious will, but they aren‚Äôt representative of ordinary conscious experience. So what if these cases have ‚Äòmany of the matching parameters?‚Äô That isn‚Äôt the same as meeting them all; perhaps we can infer that people in these outlying cases are not, in fact, experiencing conscious will when they do not meet certain parameters. But that is probably all we can infer ‚Äì one should not draw conclusions from the experiences of fringe cases. Their faulty experiences don‚Äôt really give us good reasons to think the conscious will is entirely inefficacious and an illusion.</p><p>I am also concerned the self-reporting in the ‚ÄúI Spy‚Äù experiment may have just been the result of mere post-hoc rationalizations. Obviously, that initially seems to support Wegner‚Äôs point in the first place, as he is trying to debunk what he considers to be our global post-hoc rationalization for delusions of conscious willing. Instead, I‚Äôm trying to say this is an exceptional kind of case, and not representative of our usual self-reporting. It is one thing to ask: ‚ÄúIn general, do you believe your conscious will is efficacious?‚Äù and another thing to ask someone to rate their personal intentionality in a given situation. I am not sure conscious will sits on a rated gradient at all. Reporting and rating personal intentionality may not operate in the way that Wegner assumes.</p><p>Related to this concern of self-reporting, I worry the study focuses too much upon whether or not people believed their conscious thoughts led to certain results (several steps beyond their action) rather than whether or not they caused their action directly. The action of moving and stopping our hand is phenomenologically different from the figuring out whether or not we moved or stopped a cursor on a computer screen. Moving/stopping my hand is simpler, more straightforward, more ‚Äúup to me,‚Äù relying far less upon my ability to determine causation, and perhaps even more ready-to-hand than moving/stopping a mouse or cursor (the cursor‚Äôs movement is even more abstract and distant from my action than moving a mouse). For example, we must contend with issues of being a digital native or being unfamiliar (to some degree) with using the mouse; a professional first person shooter gamer will recognize causation problems in cursors/mice that most of us won‚Äôt, and a digital native will be more equipped to make decisions concerning causal efficacy in this chain of causes than a newcomer. It is especially pertinent to keep in mind that someone with little or no experience using a mouse will have a much harder time controlling the cursor‚Äôs position on the screen than a more experienced user in the first place, much less recognizing if the cursor stopped due to their own action or another‚Äôs.  </p><p>There are varying levels of causal recognition. Anyone who has ever remotely controlled a person‚Äôs computer (for emergency repair work, occasional maintenance, or pranking your friends), especially a computer used by a non-native, can tell you that these people are momentarily tricked into thinking they are moving the mouse when they really aren‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt quite have enough experience to know immediately that they aren‚Äôt in control. Lots of activities are like this. Essentially, there are a lot of phenomenal abstractions sitting between my consciously willing to my move hand (the action itself) and figuring out whether or not I truly controlled a cursor.</p><p>Those layers don‚Äôt seem to be appreciated enough in this study. Wegner should not be testing something so far away on the causal chain; he should be testing something much more phenomenologically immediate and within the expertise of practically all with conscious will ‚Äì such as raising one‚Äôs hand.</p><p>Lastly, beyond this inductive step, even employing an inference from the best explanation principle does not seem to get us Wegner‚Äôs bold conclusion. In light of his evidence, the causes of action and the explanation of our conscious thoughts are still quite unclear. We don‚Äôt have an adequate empirical explanation, as far as I can tell. </p><p><strong>4.4 ‚Äì Evolutionary Reasons for an Illusion</strong></p><p>Wegner needs not only to provide an explanation of why the conscious will is an illusion, but he likely must also give an account of why humans have evolved to have an illusory conscious will. Our brain is expensive, and if this is an illusion, it likely costs a great deal of energy. Why would an illusory conscious will be selected for? It is unobvious how one could provide a plausible account of this. If conscious will is entirely inefficacious and an illusion, what possible purpose does it serve? Wegner is aware of this issue. He argues that ‚Äúconscious will is the mind‚Äôs compass.‚Äù<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button> But he does not give us great reasons as to why we evolved to have this epiphenomenal compass.
 
One evolutionary reason we might offer is that this illusion results in better behavior. Perhaps humans under the impression that they have control are more likely to behave in ways beneficial to the species. A sense of morality, for example, might arise from the illusion, and a sense of morality, at least minimally, might bring about the kinds of behavior which evolution would select for (although, ultimately, certain sorts of morality do seem at odds with propagation of the species).</p><p>Even if this line of reasoning were true, it remains unclear why an illusion was selected for instead of instinctual, hard-wired ‚Äúmoral behavior.‚Äù Why select for an illusion when you could get the same results for a far cheaper energy cost? It would be nice if we had a plausible evolutionary story to explain this illusion. </p><p><strong>5 ‚Äì Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is a biased thing to say that I deeply regret the possibility (however small I believe it may be) that Wegner could be right. The costs are enormous (not to sound like the world is ending but, if Wegner‚Äôs claim is correct, the moral world just might be ending for us as humans). Wegner helps opens the empirical door to a serious problem of nonveridical conscious experience and causation. His conclusions are not obviously true just yet, and proponents of Wegner‚Äôs view have a lot of work ahead of them to support the conclusion that conscious will is epiphenomenal and illusory.  </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Wegner, Daniel M., and Thalia Wheatley.
