<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was an interesting day. I studied for my test (which I never got to take; tomorrow, I guess). We then went to a Snap-On plant as a field trip. It was boring and everything I expected. I'm so glad I'm not doing factory labor. That is soul-draining. The PR/Manager spokeswoman was openly in favor of enslaving people. She spoke glowingly about how the governor was good because he made laws which benefited employers instead of employees. Nobody else seems phased by it. It was gross. As for the process though, it felt like I was watching the discovery channel on the tour. There was a ton of pipe in there too. I could build quite a bit of it. I still, obviously, have much to learn. The mounting of this stuff, that's where I know jackshit.</p><p>I spoke with Ferguson (he was my ride) about religion and philosophy today. He's a nice guy. I have a very negative perspective, but he was surprisingly charitable towards me nonetheless (that is quite rare). </p><p>I did get the cuts and most of the grinding work done on the 7-piece-90. I was interrupted though. My teacher asked for four 6&quot; long 3/4&quot; diameter pipe for the welding class. As we were finishing these (I was actually making sure Chris could do them, since I've yet to see him do screwpipe; I showed him one, and he did an okay job on the rest), my teacher interrupted that as well. He told me to come with him. We went over to the welder's giant HVAC machines which were having problems. We had to thread by hand a hole to fit our &quot;nipples&quot; (the little 6&quot; long pipes we made). I've never done that before. My teacher gave me &quot;on the job training&quot; for it. I have 3 more to finish tomorrow or the next day. I'm soaked. I have extremely sticky thread-metal shards in my hair, I ruined my gloves, and I've had to wash my hands about 7 times. It didn't work out as cleanly as we'd have hoped (not my fault), but it works. </p><p>Tomorrow I get to see a presentation by the union. I hope to make a good impression and learn a lot.</p><p>Also, I asked my teacher to see if he could find a place for me to practice pipefitting over spring break. I don't mind if I don't get paid (although, I'd like to if I could). Internships are fine at this point. I need every ounce of practice I can get.</p></div>
