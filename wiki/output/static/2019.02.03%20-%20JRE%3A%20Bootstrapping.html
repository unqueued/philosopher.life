6 HR AGO
Grabbing some wings, then off to see if i can get my drill battery charger replaced, then cleaning up my basement
5 HR AGO
That sounds delicious and productive.
5 HR AGO
I'm excited to see  your bench.
5 HR AGO
Once i got it out of the package i wasnt pleasantly surprised.  Might use some angle iron to stiff it up underneath, we shall see 
5 HR AGO
Ah. Well, it will be your starter bench to give you the chance to build the one to rule them all.
5 HR AGO
Exactly my hope
5 HR AGO
Hrm. Is there any good software for woodworking and this kind of stuff?

Storage work surface
1 HR AGO
I love it!

Pos workbench, missing one essential piece lol
1 HR AGO
I'm an insanely envious, lol. That is amazing. I know it's shit to you, but I think it's awesome.
1 HR AGO
The little black pegs on the top of the vise... should be 4, can only find 3
1 HR AGO
You are bootstrapping.
1 HR AGO
Sorry, shouldnt sound so ungrateful
1 HR AGO
No, you don't sound ungrateful. I'd be pissed too.
1 HR AGO
Im glad i have it, should make some tasks much easier
1 HR AGO
I'm about to give up on Black-wolf-3 as we have it. The CPU upgrade worked, but the BIOS upgrade has not given me what the motherboard spec says I should have, a RAM slot appears to have died. Good knews, we still have that pimp GPU. I'm going to get a barebones instead to recover what we can. He will have it. I've just failed on this particular attempt (like my cyrix godtower)
1 HR AGO
Phoenix is online and the best computer in the house by a mile. She's dual-booting, still working on passthrough.
1 HR AGO
Your workshop reminds me of my computing infrastructure so much.
1 HR AGO
I'm working to make sure the kids have done the installation work. It's a learning opportunity they will rarely have.
1 HR AGO
Oh, [[1uxb0x]] is almost finished with his MUD in Python. I think he wants you to play it.
1 HR AGO
How much would you need for his computer to be as good as hers?
1 HR AGO
We will have enough. You have already given me too much. I'm not sure yet. I'm still hunting.
1 HR AGO
We already have the SSD and GPU set. Mobo, CPU, and case is probably where I'm going to go. Gonna attempt to snipe a barebones since we already have most of what we want. Most of the cost of the gaming machine is in the GPU, which I know works (since it is identical to [[j3d1h]]'s, we've swapped them out to test).
1 HR AGO
Tell the kids they should look into Cemu to emulate the wiiu, having a lot of fub with zelda, and if i can get it running on windows, im sure with their skill they can get it to run on linux
1 HR AGO
Fun
1 HR AGO
I guess once i knew it was possible to emulate that particular zelda, i was motivated to wade through a lot of troubleshooting, they probably don't have that same nostalgia to motivate them
1 HR AGO
Oh, well, the goal is to run Windows (though [[j3d1h]] has a strong preference for passthrough we're working toward here). [[1uxb0x]] already has a pretty sweet laptop for Linux (no GPU though). [[1uxb0x]]'s machine will be dedicated Windows. They will love it.
1 HR AGO
No, they certainly don't.
1 HR AGO
Neither have dived as deep as we have into addictive gaming. This will be a valuable use of our time. They need someone who can pull them out of the water to help them see the value in what they are doing.
1 HR AGO
Obviously, it can be an amazing storytelling tool. I'm grateful they have the chance.
