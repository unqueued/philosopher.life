<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Very interesting post.
</p></blockquote><p>Thank you. I hope to keep them pertinent. I think we share a great deal in common in our admiration for TW. We probably use it differently, but it's clearly something special. I watch your posts on the forums, and I know you can see it. You preach, yo.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><blockquote><p>&quot;... I am only one man.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Right. Its a downside of making websites on your own that really you need to be THREE people working full time :-).
</p></blockquote><p>I'm actually not sure what three you have in mind. My guess is:</p><ul><li>Front-end UI Design</li><li>Back-end infrastructure engineering (which bleeds into TW)</li><li>Content creator</li></ul><p>I cannot say I'm an expert at any of them, but I have to wear all those hats. I think creating content is my primary function.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I'm semi-serious. It think its disabling the whole thing is so inordinately complex to get working well.</p><p>Its the downside.
</p></blockquote><p>UI design wise, I think I'm way, way out of my element. I think I could do the back-end work differently, but I'm so hellbent on trying to maintain specific properties, such as serving a unified document, that I make it harder on myself than I have to. I think I do not use Tiddlywiki idiomatically though, and that is a serious cause of concern for me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><blockquote><p>&quot;... you have to actually tailor the entire experience for mobile.&quot; </p></blockquote><p>I agree. For mobile CSS is only part of it. Architecture matters‚Äìlike what is IS the thing? I think it needs changing for mobile. Mobile is only as simple as simplifying the content too. Mobile with too much on-screen is unworkable.
</p></blockquote><p>Aye. My wiki simply has no place on tiny device. I have no interest in radically altering the nature of the content and structure itself to be consumable through a tiny window that lacks precision. That it works on mobile is a mere emergency convenience, imho.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Just FYI, I am contrarian in always asking, for important blogs, could this work as a printed book? I basically do NOT trust the general idea my internet today is forever. I think paper is still pretty much ace for preservation. Its highly reliable on layout. On that paper gets 10 out of 10.
</p></blockquote><p>I think you should expand on this point.</p><p>Insofar as anything is text, it can work as a book. Is it the kind of book that is enjoyable to read? No. Would it make money? No. But, I'm not sure that's a problem.</p><p>Whether or not I have internet is different from whether or not I have a computer for Tiddlywiki. I also think that TW is extremely well-suited to evading censorship. I legitimately think solar power and spare computing equipment will enable me to continue to have a working computer (and thus wiki) even after some possible Armageddon. </p><p>Interesting enough, I'm going to be printing out the source each year so that I do have paper copies. But, I'm paranoid about my horcrux-pensieve.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Its nice to talk
</p></blockquote><p>Yes. You know, I'd like to see a public Tiddlywiki from you. You are a champion of it, but I don't see you using it publicly. Why not? Perhaps I have just not been paying close enough attention.</p></div>
