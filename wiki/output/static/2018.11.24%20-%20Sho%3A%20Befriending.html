FRI 6:19 AM
we had a few days of actual good weather so we went out and befriended some more ancient shit
FRI 6:19 AM
seriously, this place is like HEAVEN
FRI 6:19 AM
it's so fucking epically gorgeous and amazing
FRI 6:19 AM
in fact, i've just updated the SHED photo site, so
FRI 6:19 AM
if you're interested
FRI 6:19 AM
will be longer before I get the nice nature landscape photos sorted
FRI 6:19 AM
i take too fucking many
FRI 6:19 AM
Doh!
FRI 6:19 AM
To answer your question, aye, I do like winter
FRI 6:20 AM
There are some aspects of it I truly treasure and revere and honour, really
FRI 6:20 AM
just as the necessary part of the life/death/rebirth cycle that it is
FRI 6:20 AM
I like things being a bit slower, quieter, calmer
FRI 6:20 AM
more introspective .. well, to some extent
FRI 6:20 AM
we both know introspection can be hell lol
FRI 6:20 AM
but you know what I mean
FRI 6:20 AM
I don't particularly like being cold
FRI 6:20 AM
and the short days are a bit of a pain in the arse
FRI 6:21 AM
like if you want to travel or do outdoor stuff
FRI 6:21 AM
but it's not that big a deal, really
FRI 6:21 AM
It's just crazy how fast things shift around here, daylight wise
FRI 6:21 AM
today is 12 minutes shorter than Tuesday was
FRI 6:21 AM
the solstice in just under a month will be an hour shorter
FRI 6:21 AM
but the summer solstice at the opposite end, the day is like 11 hours longer than now
FRI 6:21 AM
so it's extreme, but it's kind of cool, too
FRI 6:21 AM
you dinnae see such change at lower (or rather more central, I guess) latitudes
FRI 6:22 AM
that said, it is hard... usuallyi worst in february
FRI 6:22 AM
because by february, esp the end of it, esp if you grew up in a place like kentucky (tho clearly even if that's not the case)
FRI 6:22 AM
you are physically, like on a cellular level, fucking READY for a bit of warm and sun and springtime
FRI 6:23 AM
but here, no matter how much your body and soul are aching for the sun, it is not going to be remotely warm/sunny/feeling like spring (let alone summer) til at least May
FRI 6:23 AM
well, usually
FRI 6:23 AM
a few years ago we had amega heatwave in March, it was crazy
FRI 6:23 AM
and snow in June!
FRI 6:23 AM
but aye, Feb is usually when folk generally are feeling the most like AGHHH I WANT TO DIE
FRI 6:23 AM
lol
FRI 6:23 AM
So, what's new with you guys? How is everyone? hugs!
FRI 6:24 AM
Don't worry about the delay. =) I don't mind it.
4 MIN AGO
Befriending is a fascinating word here.
4 MIN AGO
yeah, introspection can definitely be hell, and winter has that Seasonal Affective Disorder thing going on for me ;P
3 MIN AGO
Wait, how much daylight do you have?
2 MIN AGO
We're doing well. I found a job working in an after-school program, assuming I pass the drug tests (ready to study for it if I must). I got the call (I assumed I didn't get the job since they took the posting down and waited forever to contact me when I expected to hear from them much sooner) a day after using cannabliss for the first time in a while. Lol. Unfortunately, edibles stick with me longer. We'll see.
