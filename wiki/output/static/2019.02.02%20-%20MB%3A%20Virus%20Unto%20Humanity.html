I'm checkin' in with ya. How's it going?
FRI 11:44 AM

Yesterday, I ate a clock.

It was very time consuming.

Especially when I went back for seconds.
SAT 9:44 PM
That's a dang good joke.
SAT 9:56 PM
Lol. Yeah. May it be a virus unto Humanity!
SAT 9:57 PM
Groans for everyone.
SAT 9:57 PM
How's life going?
SAT 9:57 PM
:joy: and how are yall this evening? Is it 10 there?
SAT 9:58 PM
Yeah, it's 10. Kids are showering, heading to bed. [[k0sh3k]] and I are working on picking out writing samples for a job I'm applying at the EFF.
SAT 9:59 PM
We had a date today (extremely rare for us normally).
SAT 10:00 PM
She wrote a poem for me today too: https://philosopher.life/#2019.02.02%20-%20k0sh3k%3A%20Poem%3A%20Dialectic
SAT 10:00 PM
Been a busy but good week.
SAT 10:00 PM
It's going! Hiw about for you?
SAT 10:01 PM
Hrmm. We must be de-synced or something. Lol. I think messages aren't being delivered normally.
SAT 10:02 PM
I can see the receipts aren't working as expected. This is interesting.
SAT 10:03 PM
I read [[k0sh3k]]'s poem! 

I loved:
 Swinging wide,
Striving for the center,
Spiraling around and down and towards the Center Star
SAT 10:08 PM
What writing samples are in the maybe pile so far?
SAT 10:08 PM
Here's the position: https://www.eff.org/opportunities/jobs/privacy-and-surveillance-activist
SAT 10:09 PM
You and this job were made for one another.
SAT 10:10 PM
Preach!
SAT 10:11 PM
I know I won't get it, but I don't give a fuck. I'm going to write the most badass cover letter ever.
SAT 10:11 PM
Yes!! Air fist pumping so hard over here!
SAT 10:11 PM
That's going to be one of my writing samples, btw. I'm going to have a &quot;standard&quot; cover letter embedded in the wiki, and one of my writing samples is going to be an article which allows me to detail (in all of my insanity) why I am qualified to have this position...which will be very link heavy (internal the wiki), irreverent, and maybe even a bit funny. So...that &quot;extended&quot; cover letter article will be one writing sample, I think.
SAT 10:13 PM
I'm going to drop this in there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1BnKd7RrjE
SAT 10:13 PM
I'm going full ballsy jester in there.
SAT 10:13 PM
You get to see one of the superpowers of the wiki now.
SAT 10:15 PM
https://philosopher.life/#:%5B%5B2018.12.05%20-%20JYU%3A%20Thank%20You%20For%20The%20Gift%5D%5D%20%5B%5BThe%20Original%20Position%5D%5D%20%5B%5B2014.11.10%20-%20Challenges%20in%20Quasi-Lockean%20Intellectual%20Property%20Theory%5D%5D%20%5B%5BCryptographic%20Verification%5D%5D%20%5B%5BLegal%20Notice%5D%5D%20%5B%5BContact%20h0p3%5D%5D
SAT 10:15 PM
Those are some of the candidates we've dug out. One of them is a letter to an ex-FB employee (a millionaire) where I tell him how much of a sinner he really is (as kindly as I can).
SAT 10:16 PM
I have the first chapter of my dissertation in there (and any of their legal scholars in the topic should cum rainbows if they see it).
SAT 10:16 PM
I'll be talking about my work with [[BDS97]] on [[Atropos]] (a radical replacement for Tor and TCP).
SAT 10:17 PM
The superpower, btw, is the ability to load up what I have on my screen with a single link. I can tell a story with multiple tiddlers (I have ~8k tiddlers).
SAT 10:17 PM
I've also got a [[Legal Notice]] which demonstrates my understanding for a number of significant legal problems, imho.
SAT 10:18 PM
My Cryptographic Verification page shows I'm not a noob (even if I'm still a beginner) who understands its value and can use the primitives (I believe). I put my money where my mouth is there.
SAT 10:19 PM
My Contact page is extremely controversial. I think they are going to have incredibly strong reactions to it, and I should point out how much I understand the ethical implications of weighing freespeech rights and privacy rights.
SAT 10:20 PM
The good news is that because of how linking (and tagging) works in the wiki, I can technically create doorways which map onto the rest of the web of my wiki as hard as I want. It's cheating, but good. I need to fucking cheat. They need to know I understand how to write hypertext.
SAT 10:22 PM
So, I can have more than 5 explicit writing samples in a way.
SAT 10:22 PM
But, I need explicit ones.
SAT 10:22 PM
This is so interesting! How do they take resumes? Is it the standard Email It In?
SAT 10:24 PM
I've not gone through the application process. I believe I will be uploading a PDF of my resume, and I'll upload the wiki as the cover letter. If I understand correctly, the application process on their site will require links as input, and I'll be linking to https://philosopher.life/FOOBAR for each writing sample.
SAT 10:26 PM
(FOOBAR doesn't exist, just a variable/placeholder here)
SAT 10:26 PM
One thing that is going to blow their minds (or at least be a fancy trick to show them), imho, is that the entire wiki will be included with the cover letter. I'll just set the &quot;GettingStarted&quot; to the cover letter in that particular html file (normally it's [[Root]] and [[Legal Notice]]).
SAT 10:28 PM
Keep me updated on the job application process! I hope this goes wonderfully:):):):)
SAT 10:33 PM
Will do, guvnuh. I'll send you the cover letter when it's ready too.
SAT 10:33 PM
Yes!
SAT 10:48 PM
How's your weekend been?
