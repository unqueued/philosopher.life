<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>When does <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> fold her tiddlers? I tried it. I really wanted to like it. It has faded away for me (even before Bob).</p><hr><p>We lost our shit over New Year's over that yodel joke. Imho, it is a form of moral schadenfreude! I hope she continues to build that place. </p><p>Love the footnote KantCon joke-comment too (it's like a present!). Ofc, I also take it seriously (because I'm a curious mamajama). The actual (Neo)Kant cons appear to be conservative virtue-signal festivals where we gather around a couple academic superstars but never actually engage in serious dialectic. I think it is a popularity contest, but not philosophy. That said, I'm profoundly indebted to my Kant teachers and indirectly the social/professional networks of Kantians.</p><hr><p>Why does Sphygmus feel she is out of place in socializing? My brother describes it something like &quot;everyone else seems to have been born with a textbook of knowledge on how to socialize, and I never got mine.&quot; I don't think that quite fits, even though she traces that out in a couple ways. Obviously, I've just said &quot;fuck it,&quot; so I'm of no use to her on this front. Reminds me of the INTJ thing again. Her physical descriptions of anxiety are painful. It is my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> that Sphygmus validates herself to herself (which isn't to say she isn't subject to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a>), but maybe I have the wrong approach. Reason is all we have at the end of the day.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">hm</sup></button></p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a> doesn't show as many as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Recent.html">Recent</a>.</p><p>Relatedly, I don't use <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Recent.html">Recent</a> on my own wiki much (but <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a> a ton). However, I use <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Recent.html">Recent</a> on other people's wikis (strongly my preference), and only use <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a> as a comparison point.</p><hr><p>I'm curious about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>' take on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Tagging%2520Theory.html">Tagging Theory</a> for her own wiki. Obviously, I spent 1.5 years on my wiki before really taking up tags at all. She's got so much more structure and understanding of what she is doing than I did that early on. The reference section works well for spidering around on her wiki.</p><hr><p>More links. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> maps onto the interwebs for me. I'm grateful for the opportunity to see the salience she picks out here.</p><hr><p>I'm curious to know if and to what <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> values originality, authenticity, accreditation, etc. (and why). I believe I've seen traces of reasoning from both <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="kickscondor.html">kickscondor</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> on this topic. </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">hm : </span> The party tonight was an important testing ground. It is a yearly event that I use as a benchmark for everyone I care about, a repeatable experiment (mildly similar at least). I have been thinking about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>' words the entire evening. My family sat upstairs with the other children and a handful of adults while most socialized downstairs. We are truly weird people who don't fit in. Alia of the Knife is right. There are clear opportunity costs, risks, and profound difficulties my children face in this arena (and I am the worst teacher). We had a fucking amazing conversation (4.5 hours), but we will rarely be able to find <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a> who speak our language. Gnostic, chosen, inept, extrema on the bell curves, whatever. I take the people in my life obsessively seriously; it all adds up. Unfortunately, I do not have as rich of a model of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> as she has of me (though I am slowly coming to learn). I may be wrong about why <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> feels the way she does, and it's important to me that she understands that (try as I might) I am very bad at understanding people sometimes. I will need to spend a great deal time more thinking about this about and with her. Her pain is real, and I must make sure I am not worsening it. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a> is lonely, and I do not wish to be maladaptive for her or increase her pain in any unjust way.</sub></p></div>
