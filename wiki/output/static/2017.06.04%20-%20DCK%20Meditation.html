<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I love collecting things. It's obsessive almost. I enjoy gathering, categorizing, and putting them together. I adore it. It pushes my buttons. My wife and I both appreciate this. I wonder if it is different for us, and if so, how so? We both have the mementos and the librarian &quot;Order, Structure, Respect&quot; thing going on inside our heads, but it's different for us. Is it different or does it just play out differently?</p><p>Phenomenology here. I have a certain mode I enter when I play Everquest. It is a powerful drug. It takes me to a different place. I strategize about the metagame the entire time. It is wonderful.</p><p>My Min-Max, zero-to-hero, A-to-Z, Alpha Omega, complete each and every step all the way to the tippy top mode is odd. I consider it to be either related to my collection obsession. </p><hr><p>I need to start formulating dating plans for my children. I want them to be comfortable with the shotgun approach. I want them to see themselves as sifting through the sands for diamonds in the rough. They need to start classifying, rating, analyzing people. </p><p>They will do it in different ways. I think women do more direct sifting. They pick and choose, and then they settle. Men knock on lots of doors. They should learn how to knock and to never stop knocking. </p><hr><p>18 truly is an arbitrary line. I want to create children that will constantly benefit from me for the rest of their lives. I need to treat my children as friends. I don't want a distant MB relationship with my kids though. I want</p><hr><p>I feel like I'm in drug user mode. Is this a mistake or the right way? I want to make wise decisions here. What are those decisions?</p><hr><p>I can see the competition now. I am literally raising my children to fight and compete with the rest of the world. I have to let go of the fact that I'm bad at this game of life. Playing life like a video game is key. What game ever fulfilled me though? I seem to hop from game to game. Not like a child, but with depth of course. </p><p>You will always be in a weird position</p><hr><p>At what point do my logs not actually help me? I think they have been. They are work. I should continue. Drone. </p><hr><p>I was young, naive, and ignorant. Perhaps I still am. </p><p>DCK is very hard this week. Executive functioning time. I have two things I'm doing that are important. 1, and the most important is that I'm looking for a job. I have my resume. I waiting for the drug tests. I cannot wait. I'm dying with anticipation. I can MIN MAX!!! I will. I am a min-max GOD! Few understand the love and addiction to it. And even fewer are as capable. My gaming minmax really is quite strong. It's odd. Out of left field but I see it. I want to teach my children to minmax through games. Then I will have a language with which to explain the world. </p><p>I fear my daughter is depressed right now. She has had a lull. I need her to be excited. How do I excite her to love life, to rejoice, to enjoy the rush! I want her to value herself and to get that early. Hell, I want that for my son too!  I want them to be chipper and happy when they wake up. I want them to wake up with a million things to do (in a good way) [as I have said elsewhere on this wiki].</p><p>How do I get my kids to embrace the grind of life? They must see that life is about working hard, and that we should start shaping it and planning for it now. </p><p>The problem with the grind is perspective. You don't know if you are flourishing. You could be riding for days, years, your life, on some shitty quest. I have to them see that they are choosing their quests in life. I have to help them see the value in paradigm shifts (thank you, mom!). </p><p>Reaching our potential is about pushing ourselves to our evolutionary limits. I worry, of course, deep down, that we're shooting for insanity. The opposite of our goal. It is an almost true Greek tragedy. To toil for so long for the exact opposite of what you seek.</p><p>I worry that obsessive workaholism in me, in the family, is not controlled appropriately. I've heard of older people who wished they just didn't &quot;work as hard&quot; for so long. Are these the words of wisdom? Or are we looking at the sad existential steps of someone who is dying that didn't' have the intelligence and gumption to get it right?</p><p>Of course, sirens sound. Alarms buzz. </p><hr><p>I love how EQ is a microcosm of reality for me. The malleability and simulation of it. The programmability shows us everything.</p><hr><p>I desperately want to build friendships with my children. That's really the key here. How to grow a human that wants to be with me and that I want to be with. I have this image in my head, and maybe it is an idol. Imago idol. The Eudaimonics! Like deities, we flourish together. It is &quot;The Good.&quot; I hear it calling, I am blinded by it. </p><hr><p>How long do we have conversations with our parents? For the rest of our lives? </p><hr><p>Visual hallucinations, strong ones. DCK is hitting hard today. And, yet, I am here. I can type. I sit with my blindfold, my computer on my lap as I lay down, and I type. It was my groin. Loo. Just for you, love. </p><hr><p>I always feel like I'm waiting to figure out where to insert myself in this world. That cloud. There is electricity, bolts of lightning, and I am scared. I must find the safe place in the cloud. </p><hr><p>Don't you see the dangers in leveraging the random seed?</p><hr><p>I wish I had my wife's reading superpowers. I'm like straight up envious. I have never been so envious in my entire life. I don't mean envy with any malice at all. She is so powerful.</p><p>God, she is powerful. I love the way she understands the world. I don't understand it. Isn't that odd? I love what I don't understand. She is a puzzle, and I am her puzzle. and god damn, do our parts fit together so well. Even when it looks like our parts don't fit together, even that is a puzzle to explore. She is my puzzle. I want to call her my puzzle. I adore her. My wife makes me want to believe in God. Think about that. I have every resource available to me to deny the existence of God. She makes me think there is some cosmic perfection to be achieved. I am so happy to be with her. It's so strong that I love her even when I hate everything. It's that obvious to me. It doesn't matter how infinitely dark it is, she still shines. Is my wife my God? </p><hr><p>Who do I seek approval from? Why?</p><hr><p>Ex Machina made an excellent point. I think it was made to be propaganda. But, the fact is that AI really could be that alien predator psychopath. It is the way of evolution. I think psychopaths, unfortunately, will rule. They are not bound by the same laws we are. We force ourselves to be bound by the laws of morality, and they do not. They have a choice, and they do not take it. </p><hr><p>Pano didn't show me the value of hard work. Games did. Everquest in particular. I learned what a drug was like. I learned about grinding there. I learned much about how the world worked through a video game! </p><hr><p>I need my children to wake up an not feel drudgery. Something is wrong if that is happening. Of course, there are ups and downs.  We will oscillate. </p><p>Visuals are strong again!</p><p>It feels so weird to type while blindfolded. It is erratic and chaotic. It is lightspeed. It is in the abyss. </p><hr><p>I was worried about EQ (a strong drug) and DCK (as well as life). I can see that it is a soup in which I cobble together my sanity. They are powerful ingredients. Very explosive. And, yet, and they are mediums in which I can interpret the world around me. They are lenses, frameworks, and paradigms. </p><hr><p>I am continually pushed from web-of-thought to web-of-thought.  Object-oriented programming, what guides this? What is the best way to maximize utility out of this? How do I beat the game?</p><hr><p>I am in the manic, getting-shit-done-optimism mode.  Pursue the Nth Degree! I'M COMING FOR YOU!! Grind that shit. You are on the way to that ultimately satisfying feeling.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>It's like an adrenaline dump, testerone pump, ambition. I feel like myself again. I feel like a genius (this is exactly where you should be skeptical). I'm flying through the visuals, wormholes, universes, lateral thoughts, metativity, abstractions, etc.</p><hr><p>Am I my wife's vampire? Am I just her leech? Have I made her life better? How have I made her life better? </p><p>Here is my worry. She is drained because I keep heaping mountain upon mountain of my bullshit upon her. She's forced to work, and I've done almost nothing for her. How am I helping her be a happier person? This sounds emo. Maybe I'm retarded.</p><p>Me trying to &quot;figure it out&quot; is stupid, right? Or is it? I don't know. I do know that she is not as happy as I want her to be, and I need to fix it. </p><p>Humility. Know Thyself. </p><hr><p>How do I navigate the world? On the physical surface, it is already very complex. So hard to understand. </p><hr><p>Is DCK like a video game?</p><hr><p>Once I escape the hole, I digest it. I'm not taking enough to be in a true K-hole, I believe. But, I'm hoping I generate enough of that random seed to change my world in a controlled fashion.</p><hr><p>Philosophy and existentialism must be learned by everyone. I think this is the critical flaw in humanity. It is why we will fall. </p><hr><p>Thought-terminator: I'm not that smart.</p><hr><p>I need a daily checklist. Who doesn't have that? I should have a real planning section. </p><p>Let's just start day by day. I can hear my parents' survivor's bias right now.</p><hr><p>My children must learn about social structures. They need to see how the objects come together. </p></div>
