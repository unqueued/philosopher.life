<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I arrived early, stopped at the information center waiting on them. I got a text from my boss, Colton, that he wouldn't be showing up for 3 hours. I wandered around for a while. Roan Mountain Park is fucking gorgeous. I asked the lady at the desk where there was going to be construction. She gave me directions. I saw one of my coworkers, Bryce, walking in as I walked out. </p><p>I arrived just in time to see the ditch witch being dropped off. One of the fellas that I got drugtested with was already there, an old man, Brian. Bryce pulled in right behind me. We talked about the job and union for a while. </p><p>Brian has been in the union for about 30 years. Bryce is a CW like me. He's not taken his test. I tried to tell him what I believed the process to be. I got some time in on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="A%2520History%2520of%2520Western%2520Philosophy.html">A History of Western Philosophy</a>. I cleaned out my vehicle. I ate some.</p><p>The park ranger, Tim Johnson, showed up multiple times. Oh, I forgot to mention, there is no phone service at all. The text message I got from Colton Dunham went through, but my reply was never sent (just permanently queued). Eventually, Colton showed up with another fella from Knoxville. A ranger walked us around the cabins and talked about thte job.</p><p>It appears that we have almost no idea where anything is. They have a few schematics, but not much (apparently, they lost quite a bit in a fire). We may have to do 1500 feet of ditch digging down to 6-18 inches by hand in 4 weeks with 4 people. That's about 2.5 feet per hour per person on this job (which it won't be). Let me cast my doubts.</p><p>We sat waiting for Colton to buy tools, water, and talk to the rangers more. At the end of the day, we set up </p></div>
