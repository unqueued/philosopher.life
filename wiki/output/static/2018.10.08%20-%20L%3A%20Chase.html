<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>I am too wired to sleep this morning apparently, so I decided to do some more research on why Chase is behaving the way he is...
Mon 7:37 AM
 He has stayed the night with us and getting him to talk about ANYTHING related to school is impossible ‚Äî we are immediately met with hostility and defensiveness. So we‚Äôve just left him alone about it.
Mon 7:38 AM
 I‚Äôm seeing now that Chase seems to have some serious executive functioning issues. I‚Äôm not sure if they came before or after the depression though. Possibly before.
Mon 7:45 AM
 I admit that I‚Äôm trying to understand someone I don‚Äôt know all that well... but from what I‚Äôm seeing/reading this is connecting the dots a bit more. Chase has likely had these executive functioning issues, specifically focused around ‚Äúinitiating‚Äù, for awhile. Instead of realizing it and helping him to correct it, his parents (and really all of us) are just nagging him about it all which just makes it worse.
Mon 7:55 AM
 That sounds like a very plausible model to me.
Mon 10:30 AM
 Presumably, it's a good thing he found being away from the house and with you guys far more enjoyable than just sitting at home.
Mon 10:31 AM
 Meds seem to be working for [[JRE]], at least to some non-trivial extent.
Mon 10:35 AM
 I'm not sure how to get the wolf off Chase's back.
Mon 10:36 AM
 I‚Äôm not sure either.
Mon 10:58 AM
 The articles I‚Äôve found say that sometimes those with poor ‚Äúinitiating‚Äù executive functioning become frustrated/embarrassed when offered help because they think others view them as dumb and THAT‚ÄôS why they offered help.
Mon 10:59 AM
 So then it‚Äôs a vicious cycle of ‚ÄúI need help but I‚Äôm too afraid/embarrassed to ask and now it‚Äôs only going to get worse‚Äù
Mon 11:00 AM
 I'm not sure what you can do besides staying in constant contact, being friends, and making sure he knows you all there to help if and when we wants it.
Mon 11:05 AM
 How knowledgeable is he?
Mon 11:05 AM
 It could be depressive realism.
Mon 11:06 AM
 There is an epidemic of mental disorders caused by capitalism among youth, and it's not just the US.
Mon 11:06 AM
 Apparently the best way to combat it as a parent is to not nag (welp...) and to be empathetic ‚Äî help them understand that we ALL don‚Äôt want to do things but we have to do them or risk facing some serious consequences.
Mon 11:07 AM
 Honestly I‚Äôm not sure.
Mon 11:07 AM
 According to [[K]], he‚Äôs never enjoyed school... so I‚Äôm honestly not sure why he‚Äôs in college to begin with except that it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs default these days.
Mon 11:08 AM
 Have you seen the lives of people without college degrees?
Mon 11:08 AM
 and by never enjoyed I mean dislikes going, never really had good grades, etc.
Mon 11:08 AM
 I have, yes. Anessa is one.
Mon 11:08 AM
 She‚Äôs only just now gotten to a place where she can afford her own apartment.
Mon 11:09 AM
 And she lives in ETOWN.
Mon 11:09 AM
 I meant that he has options outside of college like trade school.
Mon 11:09 AM
 Sorry, should have clarified. &gt;_&gt;
Mon 11:09 AM
 He'll still make near minimum wage, but it's something. If he's not got in with someone he knows, the trade union (notorious for the same good ol' boy system) is likely his only route...but, after seeing this for a while, I think even that is major luck.
Mon 11:11 AM
 To my eyes, he is screwed.
Mon 11:11 AM
 Even if he wanted to succeed, I'd bet my money against him.
Mon 11:12 AM
 That doesn't mean he shouldn't try, of course!
Mon 11:12 AM
 Life for the proletariat is only getting worse. I think school is the only risk worth taking here. That signal is going to be necessary for him to have the chance of escaping legal slavery.
Mon 11:19 AM
 I also think it's the only way to have the chance to see what's wrong with the world (although, most of the kids who graduate really do earn just a piece of a paper).
Mon 11:20 AM
 I hope for his transformation.
Mon 11:20 AM
 Me too...
Mon 11:32 AM
 Yeesh. If this is what being a parent is like, it‚Äôs no wonder we‚Äôre all some shade of fucked it.
Mon 11:33 AM
 Fucked up*
Mon 11:33 AM
 How was DnD on Saturday?
Mon 3:22 PM
 Sorry, crazy day there near the end.
Mon 6:17 PM
 It was awesome actually!
Mon 6:18 PM
 =)
a day ago
 A lot of shit happened in game.
a day ago
 Is this the game with a wiki?&gt;
a day ago
 Our silent-but-deadly ranger just had his dark, secret past come back to bite us all. And my cleric just found out that his father-figure priest is dying.
a day ago
 do you encode the session onto the wiki as a journal?
a day ago
 Nope! Different game.
a day ago
 Not this one. This one is pencil and paper notes.
a day ago
 But the one I DM for, which IS on the wiki, will have notes there from now on.
a day ago
 This Saturday‚Äôs game we call ‚ÄúAdventurer‚Äôs for Hire‚Äù and the one I DM for is called ‚ÄúMyriad‚Äù or ‚ÄúShatterguard‚Äù
a day ago
 I like that you have titles for your games.
a day ago
 Makes it easier to keep them apart in my mind.
a day ago
 yes, putting a name to something is powerful</code></pre></div>
