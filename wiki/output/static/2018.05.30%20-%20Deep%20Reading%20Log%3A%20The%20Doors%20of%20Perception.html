The being and becoming conflation is the classic problem, but I'm not convinced he has solved the problem either.</p><p>He appears to have had a much stronger trip than anything I've had outside of ketamine.</p><p>The notion that we have perfect memory seems extremely unlikely. The shutting out, however, the filtering, the Bayesian filter, seems entirely right. I'm very pleased with his evo-psych language approach.</p><p>The Glucose argument might actually have some truth to it!</p><p>He is worried about drugs making up too introspective, lacking the pursuit of what he takes to be our survival telos? Why?</p><p>The finite mind perceiving totality line is epic.</p><p>Why should I agree that rich color perception isn't evolutionarily useful to us? This seems out of line with the level of reasoning he presents otherwise.</p><p>Symbols can never be the things they stand for.</p><p>He seems to smack artists around a lot. But, doesn't he see his own word-symbols have this? Of course, but then what does he think he is engaged in?</p><p>I think his discussion of ego-death, depersonalization, and derealization is fascinating.</p><p>Someone, it is the non-reality in art that makes it most beautiful to him. I looked at those paintings.</p><p>Contemplating in its height but not its fullness...? Access, but incompatible with action and will to action, even the thought of action. Is this just him, though?</p><p>&quot;Suchness&quot; and world of contingencies.
