<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Whitney is clearly stressed about her school. I tried to get most of the work done for us. She needed more time throughout the day.</p><p>There were more 5th graders than all the other classes combined. Matt and Whitney took the older, and Mitchell and I have the 5th. Mitchell continues to select all the easy students. I am left with monsters:</p><ul><li>5NP <ul><li>Everyone agrees here, but not for the same reasons.</li></ul></li><li>5NP2<ul><li>I might be the only person having massive problems with him. He does wish to do any of his work, which is fine with me. The problem is that he is enormously disruptive to those who do wish to do their work.</li></ul></li><li>5LL<ul><li>I always have some trouble with him. He wanders and incites, but he's not as large of a problem for me. Either do your work silently or act like you are doing your work silently.</li><li>I've eased up on the tutoring. He just doesn't try at all. There's only so much I can do. If you aren't going to try, then why waste my time?</li></ul></li><li>5BG<ul><li>Retarded, violent, loud, bossy, and he doesn't try. </li></ul></li></ul><p>These kids together build a perfect storm. I'm glad to have students like 5Hf. She is wonderful. We actually got some work done.</p><p>Beyond the behavioral issues, I'm blown away by the number of students who expect me to do their work for them. That's exactly what they think counts as &quot;help.&quot; Hell, even the teachers seem to be doing that. I'm having to actually teach the concepts as we go (and that is fairly difficult in the midst of the chaos).</p><p>The fact is that the kids who are in this program don't come from families which have taught them any better or have the resources to make up for it. Those who cannot listen will be shunned. I have infinite patience for those who try.</p><p>We went outside for 15 minutes. It was so windy.</p><p>We then went to the library. Yay, I finally have the chance to get some writing done.</p><p>We then went to the gym. I did paperwork.</p><p>Delp talked with me about the boys. He might be grouchy, but he often has my back. I suggest he would only make some of those inferences if he actually cared.</p></div>
