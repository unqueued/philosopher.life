<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The vast majority of public primary schools are underfunded, understaffed student daycare centers which enable both (or single) parents to work outside the home.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> These crucial institutions no longer effectively serve (if they ever did) to maximize the opportunities and well-being of their students, regardless of background or circumstance. At best, they &quot;teach to the middle,&quot; &quot;teach the test,&quot; sacrifice education for sports and school spirit, and pass students along like number-stamped livestock. They are run like prisons and indoctrinate children to submit (since that's what these kids will be doing for the rest of their lives). Schools do whatever it takes to maximize their income and protect their livelihoods. </p><p>One reason our schools suck: the parents are malicious idiots. The vast, vast majority of people I meet are ultimately anti-intellectual in large swathes of their lives. Shit parents, shit students. While parents everywhere are at fault, they do not carry that burden alone.</p><p>Our schools are run by crooks, idiots, and people who are rarely educated themselves.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> We pay teachers criminally low salaries, and we get what we pay for. Money is funneled in all the wrong places. That we do not opensource primary and secondary education is an absurdity. </p><p>Internally, school administrators see special needs students as a drain on a limited budget and teacher time/resources. Atypical children are especially at risk of falling through the cracks. Minorities are obviously underserved, as are rural and extremely urban areas. Basically, the poorer the region, the worse the education system. These two factors which form a feedback loop only get worse over time while richer areas continue to gain competitive advantage after competitive advantage.</p><p>Preschool helps for a while, but the gains are inevitably lost in poor areas. The lives of poor children are &quot;served&quot; by a system fundamentally broken, flawed, and poisoned against them. We do not have their best interests at heart. They grow up in the wrong culture, without empathy, without effective socialization, without family life, without financial training, without practical lifeskills that extend everywhere, without food or necessities in many cases, without good medical care, without a support network, without hope, direction, and purpose. On top of this, we do not give them the educational tools which would allow them to survive, overcome, and flourish. We are all non-trivially responsible for this atrocity.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button></p><p>What makes a good public school good has everything to do with being located in a wealthy neighborhood with parents that push for it (not that wealth is sufficient, but it is often necessary, and it is a strong indicator of success in academics and in life [regardless of aptitude, discipline, or merit]). Educational gerrymandering and the bourgeoisie are real. What drives me insane is how few people understand the need for equal education levels between the poor and wealthy (&quot;if I didn't learn to read, then why should my children?&quot; from the poor and complete disregard of the poor in the wealthy), and how even fewer believe the fundamental cause of this problem is capitalism. </p><p>Public schools in those regions are functionally private schools. Poor kids are pushed out, except for sports and the appearance-quota. Living in expensive areas alone pushes out the poor. The problems the remaining poor experience in their daily practical lives give these bourgeois public-private schools even more ammunition and opportunities to cleanse and gentrify their neighborhoods and schoolyards. </p><p>Change is nearly impossible. Policy, admin, the board, and leadership throughout the school system are only kept in check by a legal system which serves the wealthy. They false compromise their way through broken promises and the destruction of the lives of the children they are meant to serve. Of course, litigation can be effective, but this may require significant financial resources not available to all parents. Ironically, those parents who do have the resources to litigate may already have the resources to find alternative education opportunities in the first place. Those who need help the most are the least likely to be able to secure it.</p><p>Charter schools are even uglier. It reminds me of the Cigarette-company owned schools in China that train kids to smoke from a young age. It's a disgusting scam, discriminatory segregation, and enslavement. But, let's be clear, non-charter's are simply more nuanced, less obvious, and indirect in their capitalist dynamics. I suspect this infection will only get worse under Trump.</p><p>The capitalist infection of American Education travels all the way up to the top of post-secondary education as well. Our opportunity-equalizing system has been hollowed out by capitalism. At best, you only get what you pay for now (and rarely that). Thus, we now subvert, subdue, harness, and condition the poor like human-livestock (to various degrees and in different ways) while merely keeping up the appearances that we don't. </p><p>For-profit education is everywhere. The slimiest of it is found in our ITT's, University of Phoenix's, etc. But, even satellite schools of major universities (even Ivy league quality) are fundamentally for-profit. Universities have become further bureaucratized and run like businesses. A financial industry has evolved around it. It is increasingly owned, operated, and shaped by corporations. Even the Ivy Leagues aren't immune.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button></p><p>Students who graduate from the slimiest for-profit schools on this Capitalist University spectrum literally hurt their reputations and are laughed out of any serious interview process. They also tend to have enormous debt for a degree that can't get them above minimum wages (which are already starvation wages). It's a direct scam across the board. They learn nothing (or even worse, learn it the wrong and obsolete way) and lose everything. These &quot;schools&quot; are marketing companies, recruiting and pushing people through the paperwork necessary to take government money in return for nothing. They are loan sharks and educational pimps. The slime lessens as you rise through the social ladder of the university system, but it is still there. I have gone to school in many settings, and the differences were remarkable. Capitalist corruptions were always there though. You still see the slime ooze through different cracks and in different ways, regardless of the school you attend.</p><p>Grad students, post-grads, TAs, instructors, lecturers, adjunct professors, and even some visiting professors are paid starvation wages (below minimum wage in many cases). This is the new norm. The vast majority of students learn from these underpaid professionals. It's a very dog-eat-dog world in academia. It is disintegrating. </p><p>We were promised the opportunity to have a good life by going to school. This was a lie. It is necessary, but not sufficient. Few really tried (partially their fault), many were given their passing grades, and the system was designed to bilk the students for everything they are socially, politically, and financially worth, without ultimately educating them. You will find exceptions, of course. But, the rule of thumb is incredibly and sadly accurate. Most come out of school with enormous debt, lacking the education they more than paid for, to enter an economy that generally doesn't want them (at least not at the wages they merit). </p><p>What else are people supposed to do though? How do you expect young 18-year-old barely legal adults with underdeveloped frontal lobes (25 years old before they begin to crystallize) and no understanding of the world to make enormous gambling decisions that will last them a lifetime? They see the wolves of poverty nipping at their heels. They have to take the risk. They must gamble, even if the odds are all against them. This is a fundamental utility equation balanced in favor of capitalists seeking to maximize the amount of human capital which can be extracted from our population. It is rent-seeking. We are debt-slaves. We are the information age serfs. We climb on top of each other just to have the slim chance for a fragment of the mobility, opportunity, freedom, and happiness that was widely available to everyone just a few decades ago.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button></p><p>Our wings and minds are being clipped. We are no longer learning who we were, who we are, and who we should be. Those are defined for us by capitalism now. Whatever helps corporations profit and gain power, those are the livestock they try to raise. Too many educational institutions and people, in general, see this obvious conflict-of-interest to be a good thing.</p><p>We now &quot;go to school&quot; to get a job. It's become the new &quot;Mike Rowe&quot; norm from conservatives. You fucking morons. Jesus, you are stupid. How could you even call yourself educated? You are either deeply ignorant (sticking your heads in the sand or lacking a real education yourself [maybe you forgot the transformation]) or you are straight up malicious (pulling a ladder up behind you). You are an anti-intellectual. You do not understand citizenship, or you seek to deny it to younger generations. You lack integrity, compassion, empathy, and foresight. You do not see why idealism is important, why it is practical and necessary. You are a fool for believing the authorities you do (including yourselves). Watch the virtuous agent non-fallaciously wield the ad hominem, and you don't even know why it's acceptable.</p><p>I hear people say &quot;college isn't for everyone.&quot; Education inflation is very real. I don't just mean that more people are getting degrees, changing demand and prices. I mean you get less per dollar and year spent in education than you used to. Learning algebra in college is normal (50% of students fail); they are illiterate. They are learning basic literacy in college. They aren't even getting a real education most of the time. And you want to deny them even that? Don't you see what is required for democracy? Don't you see what is required for the decentralization of power? The decentralization of knowledge and reason! We must educate everyone as best as we possibly can. </p><p>Look, I'm going into the trades after 10 years of post-secondary education. I have respect for working with one's hands. Some of my favorite jobs were not very respected and required significant physical labor. I see the necessity of having janitors, manual laborers, and other practical occupations. I realize not everyone is brilliant. But, I also see the possibilities for who we could be. I see how truly uneducated our population is. I know we can do worlds better, and I see how badly we need to. How could you not push for this? Admittedly, many people do not understand the value, meaning, and purpose of a real education.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button></p><p>I'm blown away by the number of STEM students who do not have or even wish to pursue a liberal arts education. They do not appreciate the humanities. The humanities, philosophy itself, the study of wisdom and truth, are fundamentally what we're doing in school. We all must understand ourselves. STEM is the child of the humanities. While STEM is beautiful and deeply instrumental, it only tells us what &quot;is&quot; and never &quot;ought&quot; outside of hypothetical imperatives. The humanities are the heart of The Great Conversation. Of course, the postmodern problem (that Aristotle was the last man to know everything that was known in the human world) makes it harder to be educated and well-rounded. We must still do our best. Unfortunately, an entire generation of STEM students are not in touch with their humanity. They are bad human specimens with strong formal and empirical reasoning skills. That's terrifying!</p><p>To strike the other direction, too many liberal arts majors fear formal reasoning. They lack true rigor, are afraid of math, and do not understand the theory of the physical world as well as they need to. They cannot interpret and appreciate STEM nearly well enough. STEM gives us context and the material with which to solve problems. Ultimately, we are not well-rounded enough as a society. It takes more knowledge in more subjects to really participate as a full citizen in today's society. We are failing tremendously.</p><p>Our education system is predatory and oppressive. Too often it serves the opposite of its purpose. That doesn't mean we shouldn't educate people or give up. It means we need to remove capitalist interests and control from the core democratic, citizen-shaping, opportunity-equalizing institution. We won't though. We are too stupid, evil, powerless, or some combination thereof.
