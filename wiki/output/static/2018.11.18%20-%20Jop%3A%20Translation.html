SUN 11:01 PM
Now I'm worried about my kids. And I have questions with your words,too. Maybe I was scared of your thoughts. Because I've had many times trying to listen to others, but many times I had a painful experience. I learned that I need to know myself. Know the ability and my own limitations. I believe in many of my past experiences. I do not think feeling is wrong because I'm a human. But in God's faith, I do not just use the feeling, but I have many experiences that I have learned.

I want to tell you that I am just a ordinary mother, not a philosopher. Not academic But I have to do everything as best as one mother can. And I look at how life is like cooking. We have to put in a lot of ingredients, but it must be balanced and appropriate, so it will come out delicious. As well as living, we can not just look at one side. Use only one course to make your life successful. But we have to use many. The subjects will be harmonized. To make life go in the way. My body has limitations. My thinking is limited because I can not think of a lot of logic. If it is an art, I have full potential. If you tell me to try to do math, it's not gonna go far. But whenever I do something I'm good at. I do not have to spend a long time to think and I can do better than many people.( You see where I‚Äôm going?)

We have had the experience to support our ideas. Three weeks ago. I asked my doctor to stop taking medicine for our anxiety disorder. I started with the drug alternate days. For two weeks Everything went well. I use exercise. Read the Bible, pray and believe God will help me. After two weeks I have not used medicine for ten days. But what I have to try to do is keeping my faith stable, exercising, making the mind comfortable.Try to eat good. Try to not think negative. I admit that there were times when your thoughts were affecting my anxiety. So I have to be very careful about getting information. I do not want to spend the rest of my live with drugs.</code></pre></div>
