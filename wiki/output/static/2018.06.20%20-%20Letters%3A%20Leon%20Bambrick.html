<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hey Leon,</p><p>Thank you for the recommendation.</p><p>I apologize for failing 21 days in a row to respond. I've had a lot on my mind. Since you also like to laugh when faced with the absurdity of the world, what are your favorite sources of humor? Are there any legendary pieces of humorous media to you that you think I should consume? The world is fucked up, and I feel like I do my due diligence in paying attention to it, enough so to have earned the right to sometimes immerse myself into something just funny once in a while. So, I'm always on the lookout.</p><p>&quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; is one of the reasons I ended up going into the trades. I feel like I have a better appreciation for Heidegger because of it too. I like how you believe there is a link between it and Russell's Paradox. I agree with you on that point (although, I don't know if for the same reasons). Heidegger's link to the Dao is a very interesting one, which imho, is linked to the virtue-theoretic fastmind's ability to pick out what is salient in our perceptions. It's our non-conscious (but trained by our neocortex) gutteral beliefs about the ideal.</p><p>There are many kinds of Platonism (the history of philosophy has been said to be a footnote to Plato); he is open, for example, to Straussian interpretation. I suggest you might actually have more in common with variations of Platonic thought than you imply. I could be completely wrong though (I know his metaphysics are extremely unpopular). You seem to be quite aware of the ideal and staunchly in favor of the real, and putting them together is a profound problem. Do you have anything else that jumps out at you, or some other gut feelings about the matter? You clearly have a trained intuition about the matter, and I'd like to have the chance to think more about it.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>h0p3
