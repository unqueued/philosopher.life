TUE 4:20 PM
Hey [[h0p3]] ‚Äî sorry, yesterday was busier than I expected. Ugh.
WED 10:17 AM
Well... mind busy at least.
WED 10:17 AM
Got word that Carson, the third oldest in [[K]]‚Äôs family, may have lost his job. The job that he also just got for Austin, the second-oldest, who Carson promised to carpool to Louisville. So Austin may not have a ride to his job he hasn‚Äôt even started yet.
WED 10:19 AM
Hopefully that made sense...
WED 10:19 AM
I think this whole family situation hit [[K]] really hard last night. He was feeling down and thinking along the lines of ‚Äúwill we ever climb out of the hole my mom has buried us all in?‚Äù He‚Äôs feeling the weight pretty hard. Trying to be his cheerleader as much as I can.
WED 10:25 AM
I think you were on the nose when you said we need to focus on helping our siblings. I think it may be the only way they‚Äôll have a fighting chance.
WED 10:27 AM
-word vomit-
WED 10:27 AM
That sucks. =(
WED 10:40 AM
At best, it is 2 steps forward, 1 step back.
WED 10:40 AM
Looks worse than that =/
WED 10:40 AM
Eking it out sucks. If there is victory, it's by a narrow margin on only a handful of paths kind of thing. So much of the world is against these young men.
WED 10:42 AM
I can understand why you guys are emotionally exhausted.
WED 10:43 AM
I'm sorry.
WED 10:43 AM
What are Austin and Carson thinking and feeling about it?
WED 10:44 AM
Austin is scared because his replacement at his old job has already been hired and he may be totally out of luck. We found out this morning that Carson may have actually been fired, but he‚Äôs being very dodgy and not answering Austin at all...
WED 10:46 AM
I don‚Äôt know what Carson is thinking. He has struggled to stay in the same place or hold down a job for any length of time. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a drug abuse situation, but it‚Äôs at least an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to commit long term to anything‚Äù issue.
WED 10:47 AM
I don‚Äôt know if he realizes his actions have screwed over his brother.
WED 10:48 AM
Something hopeful to be pulled from this thought: it is taking time, but [[K]] is breaking this cycle of poverty that his parents have buried them in. I‚Äôm hoping his siblings will see that and seek to mimic it.
WED 10:49 AM
I‚Äôm sure I help somewhere in there. But I was in a better place than him to begin with, so ya know.
WED 10:50 AM
I do not the think parents bear all (or even most) of the responsibility for that cycle of poverty. It's clear they didn't do their best by any stretch.
WED 10:51 AM
Right.
WED 10:52 AM
We did have some valuable advantages (and still do).
WED 10:52 AM
I think I would feel hopeless in their shoes.
WED 10:53 AM
When all the predictions are failure, why even try? I'd be scared, angry, and disillusioned. One must have hope.
WED 10:53 AM
Do the guys have shelter, food, and transport for the time being?
WED 10:55 AM
Have you had the chance to meet with your boss yet?
WED 11:08 AM
For the time being, yes.
WED 11:16 AM
Carson is living with the parents rn, but [[K]] is worried they‚Äôll kick him out because of this.
WED 11:16 AM
And no, not yet. Should have a chance this afternoon.
WED 11:16 AM
Fun part is, I get to drop TWO bombs on her: (1) I‚Äôm pretty sure something she did was against Humana ethics and compliance standards but I‚Äôm being gracious about it and saying something to her and (2) I‚Äôm looking around for a new job.
WED 11:17 AM
I ask you to think very carefully about (1).
WED 11:18 AM
I am a cynical man.
WED 11:18 AM
She can make your life very hard.
WED 11:18 AM
She can outright prevent you from transferring departments or finding a job outside of Humana in some cases.
WED 11:19 AM
Even if you are gracious and doing the right thing, it may cost you.
WED 11:19 AM
Wait, how?
WED 11:20 AM
Perhaps Humana policy has changed. When I transferred, my boss had to sign off. Without his signature, I could not have transferred.
WED 11:20 AM
Outside of Humana, it is possible a very diligent hiring agent might pick her brain, even off the record.
WED 11:21 AM
Well... the other option is I report her anonymously and she gets pinged with no warning. Which will make her more mad because I would be the only one that caught this.
WED 11:22 AM
Well, most likely. It‚Äôs a minor thing, honestly.
WED 11:22 AM
She emailed me the info for her corporate card which is, apparently, now against company E&amp;C policy. Wasn‚Äôt before, at least explicitly.
WED 11:23 AM
I‚Äôm not sure I understand what you mean by ‚Äúpick her brain‚Äù here either.
WED 11:27 AM
&quot;obtain information by questioning someone who is better informed about a subject than oneself&quot;
WED 11:27 AM
As I said, I don't trust your boss.
WED 11:28 AM
The anonymous route isn't anonymous. So, you have to ask yourself if it is morally obligated for you to say this to her. If it is not, then is it permitted? It depends. Is she going to use that information correctly? Will she hold it against you?
WED 11:29 AM
She may be a reference. Though, to my understanding, Humana tends to only reveal that you worked there, your position, and dates to avoid legal concerns.
WED 11:31 AM
I would think not. I have been able to be frank (in a gracious way) with her in the past and it goes over well enough.
WED 11:31 AM
Then it won't be a Bomb.
WED 11:31 AM
Ah, fair. I was being dramatic.
WED 11:32 AM
(I do that.)
WED 11:32 AM
I was also going to get a room for our 1-on-1 so I‚Äôm not saying ‚ÄúYOU BROKE THE RULES‚Äù out loud where other people can hear lol
WED 11:32 AM
I guess from my own perspective, I would want someone to say ‚ÄúHey, this is a rule now in case you didn‚Äôt know. Don‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù I‚Äôm trying to extend to her a courtesy that I would want for myself. If that makes sense.
WED 11:33 AM
I‚Äôll put it more graciously, but I want to at least inform her...
WED 11:34 AM
Aye. Initially, I didn't know if it was minor or not. Whistleblowers are treated very poorly. It was possible the violation could threaten her position, and I predict immoral reactions from someone at her level in the human pyramid.
WED 11:34 AM
I totally appreciate that. =)
WED 11:34 AM
Right.
WED 11:34 AM
And I appreciate your concern. It‚Äôs why I tell you these things.
WED 11:34 AM
I am bad about expecting the best from people even when it‚Äôs not reasonable to do so.
WED 11:35 AM
If negativity is a virus, so is positivity. &gt;_&gt;
WED 11:35 AM
Correct.
WED 11:35 AM
That said, the fitting amount of negativity and positivity will vary with each particular context.
WED 11:36 AM
What will you tell her about (2)?
WED 11:37 AM
Why are you leaving?
WED 11:37 AM
officially*
WED 11:37 AM
Well, honestly I‚Äôm leaving because her managerial style is awful. But I‚Äôll tell her that I‚Äôm just looking around (because I have to give her word before I actually submit my resume or I could get in trouble).
WED 12:30 PM
I would like to find a job that would teach me something new/exercise my knowledge base a little more because where I am now I‚Äôm hardly growing.
WED 12:31 PM
That is code she will know, but it is polite code.
WED 12:31 PM
Right.
WED 12:31 PM
Also, I would like more income since we are feeling the weight of trying to help our siblings.
WED 12:34 PM
I like that answer.
WED 12:35 PM
A lot of the help they need is financial and I want to be able to give that to them when appropriate.
WED 12:35 PM
We‚Äôre already considering paying Austin‚Äôs rent for the holidays as a gift because of this awful news. That will translate to me physically taking a check/card or whatever to the office and paying it for them so there‚Äôs no temptation for foul play.
WED 12:36 PM
When asked why you want the job in the interview, as you have pointed out, you cannot say &quot;because I need the money.&quot; It seems reasonable to say &quot;because I need the money&quot; to answer why you are leaving the job in what amounts to an exit-interview.
WED 12:37 PM
That is a cool gift, [[L]].
WED 12:38 PM
Lol... you assume I‚Äôll get an exit interview. The last girl that left didn‚Äôt...
WED 12:38 PM
/bitter
WED 12:38 PM
Telling your boss you want to leave is an informal one, imho.
WED 12:38 PM
Fair, fair.
WED 12:39 PM
Sorry for the snippiness. It wasn‚Äôt directed towards you.
WED 12:39 PM
Lol! You weren't snippy.
WED 12:39 PM
There is something wrong, no doubt.
WED 12:39 PM
I'm sorry your boss sucks.
WED 12:39 PM
There is something wrong, yes.
WED 12:42 PM
Found out that basically everyone is venting to [[K]] about the whole situation. Which translates to [[K]] having to be the adult in the situation and tell everyone it will be okay. His mother included.
WED 1:31 PM
=(
WED 2:10 PM
Definitely feels the weight of it on his shoulders.
WED 2:10 PM
Is this the part where I strangle them all?
WED 2:10 PM
Lol.</code></pre></div>
