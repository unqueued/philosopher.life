I suggest it may even be the case that those who lead rich lives on the internet are in fact living their lives on the internet. It reminds me of some original MMORPG players who would have over 3 years played on a single character (that's 24/7 years summed).</p></blockquote><p>ack, I hear you. I've been fascinated by people who have an online presence and then completely drop off the face of the digital map. One person I still strongly remember from the early days of my exploring the internet<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> was someone obscure, who posted pictures of coffee he drew in meetings and various other daily life drawing vignettes (and some amount of crow comics, too). Occasionally there were tidbits of daily moments, thoughts on biking as commuting ‚Äì just a person talking to himself &amp; posting art &amp; questioning the point of it all. </p><p>Several years later<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t2</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> he deleted his blog entirely and it made me both sad and curious. Sad, because I could feel his struggle &amp; I hoped that life was going well for him but I had no way of knowing ‚Äì also sad b/c I really liked his art<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ln</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> ‚Äì and curious, because I wondered if he had found something, some secret to living that was not held in the arms of Blogspot or Google or anything else online. </p><p>Sidebar: After reading what <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://simply.micro.jenett.org/2019/01/18/16:15:36/#comment-69" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joe Jenett</a> said about his link collecting...yeah, it's definitely something other people just spend more time on.</p><blockquote><p>This is well-said. It also sounds like Unmoved Mover territory to me.</p></blockquote><p>Right now I meet with a small group over the interwebs and this week we did some attention exercises ‚Äì place your attention on the wall, be <em>with</em> the wall, become aware that your attention is on the wall and then become aware that it is self-evident that your attention is on the wall ‚Äì <em>thoughts</em> aren't necessary for it to be true that your attention is with the wall? It tickles my mind but I don't fully <strong>get</strong> it yet.</p><p>When I ran/walked last week I tried to be simultaneously aware of the physical sensations of my body <em><strong>and</strong></em> my thoughts and that is some tricky business. Usually I'm either utterly engrossed in my thought train or I'm paying full attention to my body &amp; my thoughts are muted. Trying to do both<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> is like pressing the &quot;mind expansion&quot; super power button on my forehead and <em>somehow</em> getting a little larger, but only just barely.</p><blockquote><p>Heck yeah. Now, why? What's valuable about it to you (or the <em>gfwiwcgws</em> beyond)? Is it the phenomenology of experiencing mystery? I like mystery for being entertained, feeling like the world is not as it seems, and for the reminder of the wonderful curiosity induced by knowing I don't know in some cases. Also, what do you think of gnosticism?</p></blockquote><p>In one way, I think I am drawn to mystery as a form of escapism ‚Äì like you say, that the world isn't as it seems, and for the curiosity that it triggers. The escapist thought that by projecting a mysterious face upon the internet, my persona might be attributed knowledge or respect or ‚Äì hrm. It's hard to articulate. If I were mysterious I wouldn't be human, messy, ignorant, petty, emotional in the wrong ways, and so forth. That's for personal mystery.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p>As for wider mystery ‚Äì like, secret societies or codes/symbols/etc ‚Äì there is the appeal of being a part of the &quot;in group,&quot; perfectly accepted b/c all the rules are known and followed ‚Äì and then all the fantastical ritualism, as well (which falls apart the same way personal mystery does, but the longing or wishing still exists).</p><p>On the other hand, I'm extremely opposed to anyone claiming that they have &quot;the ultimate truth&quot; and you<sup>G</sup> just have to a) <em>do x y and z thing to prove your worthiness of it</em> or b) <em>pay a certain amount of money to gain access</em> or c) <em>have the right bloodline</em> or d) <em>and so on</em>. I think of it like the library ‚Äì if such an ultimate truth exists it's not going to be locked behind a fucking door, it'll be out in the open for anyone to stumble over. And for those who argue that &quot;the ultimate truth must remain hidden because it's too powerful/too important/too shocking/too damaging&quot; for just <em>anyone</em> to find, then also bullshit. If that were the case, most people would see the truth and not even recognize they saw it, or be able to read it or understand it or whatever ‚Äì it wouldn't need to be hidden away because its very qualities would protect it from those who weren't ready for it.</p><blockquote><p>I love the way you say it, and it sounds Romantic to me. I've usually been pretty disappointed when I uncover the person who emanates the aura (at least as best as I understand this term). The hunt, the dreaming of the destination, and the aura itself is sometimes more alluring, interesting, or beautiful than the originator. Perhaps the issue is &quot;aura&quot; to whom?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">gf</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> You can never have the mysterious allure for everyone. Who do you want to sense and be attracted to your mysterious aura? Why?</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, this is why I link it to the theme of searching for &quot;The One&quot;. The chase, the enchantment, the butterflies, the hope and longing, all that seems to be associated with mystery and not <strong>knowing</strong> someone or something. Mystery captures attention, I think, and as someone who typically played the role of chaser, it would be thrilling to be the pursued, the listened-to, the fascinator.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">b</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p>(SO vs FO wants? I still don't quite understand the difference ‚Äì) but I don't <strong>really</strong> really want to be mysterious. you<sup>G</sup> can only go on for so long being mysterious before feeling like nobody <em>really</em> knows you<sup>G</sup> ‚Äì there's an element of holding back the truth about how you<sup>G</sup> cry during certain movies or sweat while lifting weights or slip on ice and fall on your bum.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">w</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> So, yeah; I actually want to be muddy-feet honest and humanly accessible.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">rm</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><blockquote><p>Your picture had me giggling,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">i</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> but I can feel that pain. I assume auras of mystery take a long time to cultivate. For whatever it's worth, I'm constantly thinking about who you are through your wiki. It may be more literal and plain than you wish it to be.</p></blockquote><p>Invisibility cloak! Yes! You see it. :)</p><p>I'm not sure auras of mystery take a long time to cultivate ‚Äì given my thoughts above, they require a devotion to a certain amount of <em>hiding oneself</em> which ‚Äì well, that links back to your clearnet doxxing, amirite, and being open &amp; transparent and the anxiety that comes with that and also the legitimate concerns that come with it ‚Äì and just generally, well, are mysterious people on the internet merely private people? or are they <em>intentionally</em> hiding to create mystery? or is it both? what is privacy irwartfrr?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sp</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p>It can't be said enough: thank you for thinking about me with me.</p><blockquote><p>The wiki might be too telic and computational for what you're after in your examples. It lacks the polish to be visually gorgeous and <em>antipleonasm</em>ic. It's boxy.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> Maybe the wiki isn't the art you really want to create? I think it's an art you are talented at though. </p></blockquote><p>I hear what you about the wiki lacking polish etc, but I'm not convinced, especially since I just spent a morning futzing around with my CSS again. üòÇ I am serious about shaping my wiki to present the tangles of text as cleanly and elegantly as possible, while still keeping the power tools close to hand.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">st</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><blockquote><p>Imho, your examples are simple, as in: simple simpliciter tout court. I am convinced elegance is beauty emerging from simplicity, but simplicity is relative to a context (including an observer). I think you should be slow to say you aren't creating anything elegant. Complexity can only be reduced so far (and reductions can rarely be complete).</p></blockquote><p>aha! yes, okay ‚Äì I will revise that to say, I make nothing mysterious here, but perhaps elegance will arise or is present. :)</p><blockquote><p>Even though you rightfully find it terrifying (and I with you), I find your self-consciousness beautiful.</p></blockquote><p><button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span>I conclude that we must dive into the terror of honesty together; we are two people honestly confronting ourselves over and over again ‚Äì I can't do your work for you, and you can't do mine for me ‚Äî we're swimming in a giant pool, and you are in the lane next to me, and kicks in the lane beyond that ‚Äì or somehow this is a tesseract and we are all swimming in the lanes next to everyone else, simultaneously ‚Äì yeah, I don't know where this metaphor is going either.</p><blockquote><p>I know I have asked similar questions before. I can't help but ask them again. What do you want your art (and even the art of your person, aura and all) to be? What do you hope to express in the end and to whom? I'm not claiming either of us can ever fully answer these at any given time (they probably evolve). They seem to be conceptually necessary to engaging in art though.</p></blockquote><p>I don't know! I think the answer can only be transient ‚Äì I hope to become the most honest <em>myself</em> possible, and further than that, I hope in the butterfly effect. I'm not sure I can ever know what I will end up expressing to other people ‚Äì what people get will vary based on how aware they are and what they project onto me and so forth.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">gah</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> </p><p>Rereading my old journals, I was so frustrated with people putting themselves down, saying they &quot;weren't creative&quot; or couldn't draw or <strong>do</strong> anything because ‚Äì motherfuckers! I'm not special! We've all got these abilities! you<sup>G</sup> love to cook? you<sup>G</sup> love to woodcarve? you<sup>G</sup> love to sing in the car? That's fucking fantastic! you<sup>G</sup>'re creative! Don't sit around comparing yourself to someone else &amp; beating yourself up, just <strong>DO</strong> that shit!<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">hil</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p>If it's even coherent to say it ‚Äì I want to be Light. I can't hate people. There is <strong>so much</strong> in this world that I want to be different, but I can't ‚Äì I'm in tears over this right now ‚Äì deep down in whatever makes me <strong>me</strong> I can't believe that the essence of Humanity isn't good, despite my terror that we aren't.</p><blockquote><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#Tickler" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tickler</a> is a great name. My <em>TDL</em>s are a source of shame for me. I will be thinking about how you do it. Lawd willin', I'll get there too.</p></blockquote><p><code>:)</code> It's a reference to <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickler_file" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tickler files</a>, which I believe I was reminded of by poking around someone else's wiki? I can't find the inspiration now. ‚Äî OH yesh! I was looking at the dynalist of wiki stuff in the calendar section and saw a tickler file plugin, which gave me the name of the tab.</p><p>I'm worried I made a mistake by writing them down ‚Äì I don't want to make myself feel obligated &amp; then avoid doing them ‚Äì but at the same time I find myself forgetting all sorts of daily details because I'm so caught up in everything BIGGER.</p><blockquote><p>I've made <em>REDACTED</em>. Deleted that tiddler as well. =)</p></blockquote><p>Thank you for the consideration!</p><p>My goal is to be able to display that web address on artcards,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">bc</sup></button>
<span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span> or on stickers in public places, without leading anyone to . I'm not ready to swim in the deep end <em>quite</em> that much yet. But, if anyone should go from  to my studio, it's not the end of the word. Redacting the URL is just a leftover from my sanitization script when I didn't have <em>anything</em> but a parked URL page there...I haven't taken it out of the script yet b/c I'm not 100% sure <strong>I</strong> want to link to it...but it's cool if you do.</p><blockquote><p>That tiddlymap is still blowing me away. It burns CPU. I'm worried I won't be able to do anything similar here.</p></blockquote><p>Eliminating the large logs (Carpe Diem &amp; Wiki Review) was key to even loading the whole wiki without completely locking my browser for a few seconds. They're also the logs that a) don't usually link anywhere else in the wiki and b) link to everything in the wiki, so they make good maps on their own.</p><p>Since I'm curious now, I'mma try and stick TiddlyMap in your wiki ‚Äì I'll let you know how it goes!<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">heh</sup></button>
