SAT 3:26 PM
You are officially a wigger, sir.
SAT 3:27 PM
*homie
SAT 3:27 PM
yall get any snow?
SAT 3:28 PM
light dusting at my brother's
SAT 3:28 PM
Not yet. Still on tractor. Lol
SAT 3:29 PM
Didn't know if it melted or anything. We thought we might get some, but didn't.
SAT 3:29 PM
We are slated for snow Tuesday. It's cold but I've been outside working in shorts and a hoodie. Lol
SAT 4:12 PM
You need a beer.
SAT 4:13 PM
It will be complete.
SAT 4:13 PM
Also, down to talk about how I became a heathen non-Christian over the phone whenever you'd like, lol.
SAT 4:14 PM
I'm an recovering alcoholic. Beer sounds good though. Trying to not.
SAT 4:14 PM
We have family coming in next week. We have been working our tails off today getting house and property ready.
SAT 4:15 PM
Then a beer would not complete it, lol.
SAT 4:16 PM
Well, I hope you can get it all set for the family.
SAT 4:16 PM
I keep the expectations low on that front; thankfully, they oblige me.
SAT 4:17 PM
It's all about appearances... Trying to make it look like we have all our shit together all the time. Lol.
SAT 4:17 PM
Ha, I hear that.
SAT 4:17 PM
My parents, my grand parents, my wife's parents, and her sister brother in law and niece are all coming to see my daughter perform in the children's theater.
SAT 4:18 PM
They will all be staying with us. So...
SAT 4:18 PM
That sounds pleasant.
SAT 4:19 PM
Did you ever get withdrawal symptoms from kratom?
SAT 4:20 PM
I used it once. Immediately became extremely sick; I was in so much pain I could only lay on floor of bathroom and shit upwards like a volcano.
SAT 4:20 PM
I did not experience withdrawal symptoms to my knowledge.
SAT 4:21 PM
I have read about it though.
SAT 4:21 PM
I am trying to monitor my intake, and ensure it is not a daily thing... But I have a very addictive personality. And if it feels good I like to do it. Escape reality. Head change. Blah.
SAT 4:21 PM
The Hedonic Treadmill
SAT 4:22 PM
I'd rather smoke weed but that is not an option. The effects of kratom to me are similar to getting high and taking a pain pill.
SAT 4:22 PM
Perhaps I should try it again.
SAT 4:23 PM
But you get to smoke. Or use thc...
SAT 4:23 PM
100 times better. Imho
SAT 4:24 PM
I hope to naturally pass drug tests whenever I can, so I've abstained for quite a while now.
SAT 4:24 PM
I anticipate the opportunity to take one soon.
SAT 4:24 PM
I've never gotten to try one of the expensive vape machines.
SAT 4:24 PM
I can't smoke; I'm simply too sensitive for it.
SAT 4:25 PM
I used to puke my guts out every time I was even in the house of someone who smoked (they didn't even need to be smoking).
SAT 4:25 PM
I have a Valium script which I take when I need it or want a buzz. But my tolerance is very high and it is very addictive. So I have to take days off alot to ensure I don't have withdrawals.
SAT 4:26 PM
I took Xanax in college and when I left the dog gave me as much refills as she could and said good luck. Going through withdrawals of Xanax was a horrible experience.
SAT 4:27 PM
I tried cold turkey for 3 days and I think my hear was going to explode. Alcohol did not make the feeling go away. No matter ho much.
SAT 4:27 PM
I'm not a huge benzo fan. I have one that lasts for 18 hours (just from .1ml of this liquid...and I have over a liter): https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Flubromazolam
SAT 4:28 PM
I had to ween myself off them buy tapering. And then I was off. But yeah. I've been thru real withdrawals.
SAT 4:28 PM
And that was by choice.
SAT 4:28 PM
the addiction, withdrawal, and interactions with other substances are not cool
SAT 4:28 PM
I don't feel the addiction of the substance, but I refuse to use it often because I'm flat out scared of it.
SAT 4:29 PM
I'm sorry to hear about that hell, man. I do not want to experience that all.
SAT 4:30 PM
Yeah  I prefer legit pharma pills. Other than kratom. Dude I was like 22 years old, that was a decade ago. I learned my lesson about addiction.
SAT 4:31 PM
But weed isn't like that.
SAT 4:31 PM
only psychological withdrawal symptoms, not physical
SAT 4:31 PM
I get addicted to it abuse I like the way it makes me feel. Yeah. Excatly.
SAT 4:31 PM
Kratom I kind like that but more like coffee withdrawal if done for a week strait or more.
SAT 4:32 PM
And coming off of caffeine is no joke.
SAT 4:32 PM
I smoke cigg at work. But not at home. So I'm not addicted. I smoked a long time too. Quit when Samantha was born, then started again then quit again. Now just a work thing. Stressful job....
SAT 4:33 PM
Talking about that liquid stuff. I took some liquid methadone once from a guy who got it from a clinic. I was high for 3 days. Couldn't function for one of them.
SAT 4:35 PM
lol
SAT 4:35 PM
This kratom I have can cause stomach problems like constipation.
SAT 4:35 PM
yes
SAT 4:36 PM
I'm currently addicted to 5hr energy shots.
SAT 4:36 PM
Sounds like you need legal weed, homie.
SAT 4:36 PM
Or the b12 and caffeine....
SAT 4:36 PM
I keep a warchest of nootropics too. They are fine, but they do not solve my problem.
SAT 4:36 PM
Though, they help.
SAT 4:37 PM
Yes. When I smoke weed I don't take my Valium unless I have panic attacks. And I don't desire alcohol.
SAT 4:37 PM
I have a fat sack of medical grade weed in the house. I keep it on hand in case of potential suicidal tendencies.
SAT 4:37 PM
Noice.
SAT 4:38 PM
The backup is nice.
SAT 4:38 PM
I keep ketamine as my backup for suicidal tendencies.
SAT 4:39 PM
It's a safety net. I keep it in the same room with all my guns.
SAT 4:39 PM
Bwahahaha
SAT 4:39 PM
Image attached to message
SAT 4:39 PM
I think we have more in common now than we ever had when we lived near each other. Lol
SAT 4:40 PM
Of course. Still major differences on economics. But that's just cause I know more about markets than you.
SAT 4:41 PM
Hahahah
SAT 4:41 PM
lol. =)
SAT 4:41 PM
I think we share a lot in common.
SAT 4:42 PM
But I'm gonna need you to go back and make up with Jesus.
SAT 4:42 PM
Cause the smartest guy to know. Who I have always held in one of the highest regard.
SAT 4:42 PM
Is a non believer.
SAT 4:42 PM
I know*
SAT 4:43 PM
It has been a long time coming.
SAT 4:43 PM
For what it's worth, I still hold the two greatest commandments in maximal esteem.
SAT 4:43 PM
God exists.
SAT 4:44 PM
We agree?
SAT 4:44 PM
Maybe not Jesus and the trinity. But this cannot exist without a God.
SAT 4:44 PM
I do not think God is an agent.
SAT 4:45 PM
I think God is transcendent, difficult to name, infinite in nature, absolute, unconditional...I think God is by definition The Good.
SAT 4:46 PM
OK. So we agree.
SAT 4:46 PM
I'm just banking on Jesus cause streets of gold and stuff.
SAT 4:47 PM
I think even our understandings of Christianity are going to be really different.
SAT 4:47 PM
And you play guitar now?
SAT 4:47 PM
Aye. Picked it up a while back.
SAT 4:47 PM
I was skimming your wiki page.
SAT 4:47 PM
stopped playing, just started again recently to play with the kids
SAT 4:47 PM
I'm not very good, but I have fun.
SAT 4:48 PM
I've just picked it up again as well.
SAT 4:48 PM
I hate we have so much in common. And your a fuxking communist.
SAT 4:48 PM
Lol
SAT 4:48 PM
rofl =)
SAT 4:48 PM
What do you like to play on the guitar?
SAT 4:49 PM
I tried to send you a video. It's too big.
SAT 4:55 PM
I just got a new amp and cabinet last weekend for my electric. And a new acoustic a couple of weeks ago
SAT 4:55 PM
Let's use resilio sync to send files
SAT 4:57 PM
(of any size, to as many devices as we want, private, decentralized, etc.)
SAT 4:58 PM
That's the key I gave you before.
SAT 4:58 PM
Your confusing me.
SAT 4:59 PM
https://www.resilio.com/individuals/
SAT 4:59 PM
It's the best tool I've ever found for long-term file transfers. It's how I send files to family and friends.
SAT 5:00 PM
Of any size!
SAT 5:00 PM
Does it work on android?
SAT 5:00 PM
I use it to transfer files between my phone, desktop, and laptop. It keeps them all synced nicely for me.
SAT 5:01 PM
yes, works on Android
SAT 5:01 PM
Free download or paid thing?
SAT 5:01 PM
Or you gave me the paid key?
SAT 5:01 PM
The free version works very well. The paid has some other features that you will not need.
SAT 5:01 PM
That is our private key.
SAT 5:01 PM
a key to read and write to some directory we both control
SAT 5:02 PM
I put a book in there for you months ago, hehe.
SAT 5:02 PM
OK. I'll try it.
SAT 5:02 PM
It's on markets. I think you'll like it.
SAT 5:02 PM
How a competitive free market is the ideal solution to all the world's problems with a few  regulations for known market failures.
SAT 5:03 PM
Monopolies, externalities, and those who cannot help themselves.
SAT 5:04 PM
It does attempt to handle those concerns. I make no claims to their success.
SAT 5:04 PM
Lol. We both know economics, next to philosophy are two of the most complex subjects IMHO
SAT 5:05 PM
Well, try it out. There are several neat moves in the book. I consider these folks my frenemies on the other end of the spectrum.
SAT 5:07 PM
Sync doesn't show thumbnails of pics or videos.
SAT 5:07 PM
It will show whatever your file browser shows
SAT 5:08 PM
if you choose to use your filebrowser
SAT 5:08 PM
Me goofing around with new amp. Listen closely at beginning.
SAT 5:16 PM
Ypu might miss it.
SAT 5:17 PM
The other is kiddo goofing off in car.
SAT 5:17 PM
I did not miss it. Lol.
SAT 5:20 PM
I sent it to my whole family on face book. And momma was like so good, I love your shorts, and everyone missed it. I had to spell it out.
SAT 5:21 PM
lol
SAT 5:21 PM
They probably knew and just didn't say anything, right?
SAT 5:21 PM
It was overt.
SAT 5:21 PM
Perfect timing. I made it to send to to my friend [[JRE]]. And I clicked record. Then I just had to commit. Lol. Not something I woukd post on YouTube.... Just showing off my amp really...
SAT 5:23 PM
I've been practicing everyday and alot of skills are coming back. Slowly. And picking up songs again quicker.
SAT 5:23 PM
I play whatever. I'm bad about learning cool intros to songs, or solos. But no the whole song. Then adapting and making my own noise.
SAT 5:24 PM
Country, grunge, old rock....
SAT 5:24 PM
I like blues, celtic, and classic the most so far.
SAT 5:25 PM
blueglass too*
SAT 5:25 PM
I still trying to make my finger play the g chord. I do what I can.
SAT 5:26 PM
Lol
SAT 5:26 PM
Lol. I thought you sounded good, especially for just picking it back up.
SAT 5:26 PM
Do you play by ear, tab, sheet music?
SAT 5:26 PM
Thanks.
SAT 5:26 PM
All tab.
SAT 5:27 PM
I think tab is the way to go on a guitar too.
SAT 5:27 PM
That's how I taught myself.
SAT 5:27 PM
It has numbers. Made alot of sense to me.
SAT 5:27 PM
Image attached to message
Me and kiddo in my old &quot;hot rod&quot;
SAT 5:29 PM
Sporting the Berea College hoddie. Lol
SAT 5:30 PM
I have a Berea license plate on my car.  A Berea alumni plate cover on. My truxk. And a Berea College lanyard.
SAT 5:31 PM
I have grown proud of my accomplishment there.
SAT 5:31 PM
You appear to miss Berea quite a bit.
SAT 5:31 PM
I'm forever grateful to have the chance to go to Berea.
SAT 5:31 PM
I'm just a proud alumni. Not alot of people could do what we did. Most of my friends flunked out.
SAT 5:32 PM
I was the only American econ major in 07. That was huge to me.
SAT 5:32 PM
So I took all my 300 and 400 level courses with brilliant minds from all over the world. And my stoner ass was there. Keeping up. And editing their papers while they helped me with my math. Lol
SAT 5:33 PM
lol =)
SAT 5:34 PM
Good times.
SAT 5:34 PM
It was Berea or the military for me. Only way to get as far away from Georgia as I could.
SAT 5:36 PM
I was dissapoited when I found out I got accepted. I was going to go into the navy.
SAT 5:36 PM
I can only hope better for our chillun.
SAT 5:37 PM
But now I build war machines for a living. And support the army special forces.
SAT 5:38 PM
That may be a place we also differ.
SAT 5:38 PM
You mean 50% of government spending on military is too much?
SAT 5:38 PM
I think that is only the tip of the iceberg.
SAT 5:39 PM
I think your job is immoral. =(
SAT 5:39 PM
I think what the military does is a crime against humanity.
SAT 5:39 PM
I say this as a man who has killed people by working for Humana.
SAT 5:39 PM
I'm in it for the pay check man. And I am proud to make good helicopters that are safe for the guys that fly them.
SAT 5:39 PM
I think that is an excuse, like these:     A rising tide lifts all boats.
    I'm just doing my job.
    Hate the game, not the player.
    Someone else will do it if I don't.
    It's just business.
    Vote with your wallet.
    It's good for the economy.
SAT 5:40 PM
I suppose my blind nationalism helps. Me sleep at night.
SAT 5:40 PM
Haha, that is also important. I'm radically opposed to nationalism.
SAT 5:41 PM
I think Jesus obviously agrees with my perspective too, btw. =)
SAT 5:41 PM
Indeed. He does. But someone has to protect the oil fields and poppy fields.
SAT 5:42 PM
Might as well be America.
SAT 5:42 PM
true dat
SAT 5:42 PM
Lol. I respect your opinion. But the global delima is so complex with nationalism so engrained. I am not sure how you cure that.
SAT 5:43 PM
I think what is morally expected of us is not necessarily that which is predicted to succeed.
SAT 5:45 PM
I'm not convinced you've really spent a significant chunk of your life searching for an answer to that colossal problem either.
SAT 5:45 PM
Just because we don't know the cure doesn't make what we're doing right.
SAT 5:45 PM
Agreed. On all points.
SAT 5:46 PM
Read the book. I am actively working on a solution (like an arrogant asshole that I am).
SAT 5:46 PM
But we can't even decide if att and sprint should merge or not.
SAT 5:46 PM
There is a section of quadratic voting that I think is fascinating, and there may be something correct about it.
SAT 5:47 PM
Obviously they shouldn't.
SAT 5:47 PM
We have Donald trump as president. It's a circus man....
SAT 5:47 PM
I suppose I keep my head down and try to just live the daily.
SAT 5:47 PM
I spend a lot of time thinking about it. I realize there is little hope. I must try anyways.
SAT 5:48 PM
I have few that I can discuss with that wouldn't gut their brother for Donald trump or suck Hillarys ass for a autograph.
SAT 5:49 PM
They are both psychopaths. I aim to decentralize power.
SAT 5:50 PM
Marx is worth your time. You should read a book or two on him.
SAT 5:50 PM
I read enough on him in Berea.
SAT 5:50 PM
Really?
SAT 5:50 PM
Beautiful ideas.
SAT 5:50 PM
What classes?
SAT 5:50 PM
Utopias
SAT 5:50 PM
To my knowledge, there wasn't anyone there qualified to teach him when I attended.
SAT 5:51 PM
There is that arrogant Sob! Lol
SAT 5:51 PM
Lol ;P
SAT 5:51 PM
When did you get that PhD?
SAT 5:51 PM
I have not, lol.
SAT 5:52 PM
That was rude. But intended to be in jest.
SAT 5:52 PM
We read excerpts with caryn vazanna, and I know another gstr that was in the ag building.
SAT 5:53 PM
Caryn was the most qualified there. By I know you probabaly disagree.
SAT 5:53 PM
And cliff sowell
SAT 5:53 PM
Aye. I find most economists don't know the first thing. =/
SAT 5:54 PM
If you don't know Marx's teacher, you don't know Marx.
SAT 5:54 PM
Let's table this for the phone call. We will. Never get off this subject. And I will begin looking at the book u put on sync
SAT 5:55 PM
Cool beans.
SAT 5:55 PM
I'mma hop off here. We have dinner with friends. So I need to shower.
SAT 5:56 PM
Also, please note. That when it all goes to shit you need my address. REDACTED
SAT 5:56 PM
Come here. You and your family will be safe.
SAT 5:57 PM
Thank you, sir! I hope it never comes to that.
SAT 5:57 PM
I hope it does....
SAT 5:58 PM
Accelerationist!
SAT 5:59 PM
=)
SAT 5:59 PM
I'm buying another box of DOD MREs tonight.
SAT 5:59 PM
Lol.
SAT 5:59 PM
Hahah.
SAT 5:59 PM
I have not figure out the fuel situation though... Tractor will run on ethonal. But I don't have a truck that will.
SAT 6:00 PM
For prep, you might go solar and handtools as hard as you can.
SAT 6:01 PM
We will get there. If it's an emp. My old hot rod will run with the old distributor.
SAT 6:01 PM
Ammo will. Be the highest valued good I think. I have all the hand tools.
SAT 6:02 PM
A few horses would be good though.
SAT 6:02 PM
And sheep.
SAT 6:02 PM
Alright I gotta get off here. It's been good bullshit ting with you man! We have to get together after the holidays
SAT 6:03 PM
