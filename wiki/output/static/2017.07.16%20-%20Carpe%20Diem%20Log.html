<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><ul><li>Woke up to wife initiating. Been a long time! I actually turned her down (was I crazy?) because I was just so sleepy.</li><li>We laid in bed together and talked. It was wonderful.</li><li>I played a game of league, and they went to church. I considered going, but realized would not have made a better day</li><li>Instead, I went for DCK. I'm glad I did. It was difficult, but not too bad. I cried, which is something I rarely do on DCK itself (although after often enough).</li><li>Everyone came home. We had family time on the bed just laying there and talking.</li><li>I talked to ALM. He apparently reads the wiki. Hi, bro!<ul><li>We had some quick catchup. I've barely been able to contact anyone (and as you will find out, that trend is going to continue this week, hardcore-style)</li></ul></li><li>We had our family meeting.<ul><li>This one was difficult for everyone.<ul><li>My son just straight up said he doesn't like me, wanted to keep his negative attitude/lense, etc. <ul><li>It took a long time to talk through it.</li></ul></li><li>My daughter didn't do her work on her wiki, and it showed.</li></ul></li><li>By the end, we were glad we did it. We stuck through it, and it was worthwhile.</li></ul></li><li>The ladies cooked while the boys packed.<ul><li>I got my lunches and dinners mostly set. Should be quite healthy and something I can stomach on the jobsite, I believe. </li></ul></li><li>We ate amazing chicken wings and fries. <ul><li>We ate so amazingly this weekend.</li></ul></li><li>I left, drove almost all the way there, wanted to check the time and I found out I forgot my phone somehow. I was horrified.<ul><li>I doubled backed, but then I did the math and realized I would be arriving at 1am. I so much need my sleep I can't afford to do that. It's going to be an interesting week.</li></ul></li><li>I listened to Infomacry. At about the same I realized I didn't have my phone, all of the major &quot;Information&quot; internet services were disconnected around the world. It was kind of ironic in its annoying parallel to my own connection problem.</li><li>I realized that I may be breaking out in hives due to stress. It broke out further on my arm during the trip after I realized the phone problem. This is good to know about my body.</li><li>I arrived, and Armstrong had left me a note. My wife called. =) Hey babe!</li><li>I put everything away, the new sheets on, and put the lotions on its skin.</li><li>I couldn't connect to the internet, so my latest copy of the wiki isn't synced to this laptop, and thus I'm writing it in sublime text editor. </li><li>Time to relax and fall asleep to, /drumroll, Mr. Robot!</li></ul></div>
