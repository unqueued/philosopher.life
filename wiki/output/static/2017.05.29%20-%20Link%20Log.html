This deserves more attention than it is getting, I think. It very well may be the next kind of metanarrative after postmodernism. At the very least, it gives an excellent mile-high overview of the premodern to postmodern moves.</li><li>Continental Intersubjectivity Verification (in its Modern, Postmodern, and perhaps even Metamodern versions) and Analytic Neo-Kantian Reflective Equilibrium are pointing to the same thing, as I thought many times.</li><li>The anti-scientific view may be correct in many respects, although I think we can't force all of these moral and metaphysical issues on them. There are philosophical undercurrents here as well that should be fleshed out, particularly in analytic philosophy.</li><li>This is not how I passed through the postmodern fire exactly. But, I'm a weird one. I thought modernism could hold onto premodern thought more than it did. And postmodernism actually didn't detract from my moves to a point. </li><li>I think they've attributed capitalism egoism to modernism too strongly. It fits the industrialization narrative, but there are components which actually are more postmodern justifications, not modern ones, imho. This is where continental and analytic traditions drift apart in their understand of the Great Conversation in some respects, imho. I see Heidegger's postmodern, anti-science moves as still indirectly (and ironically) fueling scientism and some of things the author attributes to modern thought.</li><li>This metamodern critique of postmodernism seems only partially correct. The problem is that there might not be any answers. The metamodern has to assume hope, must be religious even, about escaping postmodern criticism. Own up to your faith here, hypocrite. Inefficacy of fighting against capitalism is hardly an argument against socialist positions either. You've purposely misunderstood the nature of psychopathy and egoism here. <ul><li>Criticism precedes construction, but just because someone doesn't have the answer doesn't mean their criticism is wrong. It just means they don't have a complete &quot;drop-in replacement&quot; or &quot;fix&quot; to the problem they have pointed out.</li><li>I await your &quot;Metamodern&quot; solution. It clearly isn't working yet either. </li><li>Ultimately, all you have is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a>, my friend. You morally expect us to succeed, but that doesn't mean you should realistically predict it. It is a practical matter than we ignore our practical predictions, in a sense.</li></ul></li><li>Speaking of privilege, you have no room to talk.<ul><li>That you think GW Bush and Putin aren't modern-appearing expressions of postmodernism leaves me questioning whether or not you really understand the problem here.</li></ul></li><li>Unfortunately, I must ask for clarification on ontologies here. I worry you are trying to have your cake and eat it too, but with a sleight of hand. Your thesis of commensurability, again, is a kind of faith, a hope, a reason to keep trying. </li><li>The claim that we are &quot;obliged to try to reconstruct&quot; has no grounds other than faith. Take up the mantle, hypocrite, and then we'll move forward. The hermeneutic circle/spiral of the Great Conversation does not require we move in this direction. It is something we simply will because we want to, because it is practical, because it is the hopeful thing to do.</li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://i.redd.it/lgaxap0fhi0z.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://i.redd.it/lgaxap0fhi0z.jpg</a><ul><li>Zing, asshole!</li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/05/the-online-radicalization-were-not-talking-about.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/05/the-online-radicalization-were-not-talking-about.html</a><ul><li>One of the few articles I have ever encountered which takes the time to distinguish different &quot;Redpillers.&quot; I usually see a very poorly researched and empathized perspective, a strawman. This was closer, but it still missed the mark (as usual). Admittedly, I believe I know what the One True Redpill is, and I'm waiting to see if people finally figure it out. I'm not holding my breath, as it is the antithesis of much of the Humanities and many religious (even those who call themselves secular humanists are being religious) perspectives. I think it's such a tough pill to swallow that it becomes a difficult pill to even see in the first place. Few can empathize long enough with the various Redpill groups to see what they really have in common. They all realize that humans are selfish, egoistic creatures. They might not be good at applying this principle (some are hideously retarded about it even), but you can see the kernel of truth hiding in their bullshit. It shines forth brightly like a gem. Do you hear that Kant? A gem. Pay attention, because your definition of &quot;Reason&quot; implodes around it.</li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://danwang.co/why-so-few-computer-science-majors/?idk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://danwang.co/why-so-few-computer-science-majors/?idk</a><ul><li>This is the million dollar question I'm trying to answer for my daughter.
