<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I need to mail my thing to AB&amp;T. I need to cash some checks. I need to fix the car (control arm and electrical); I feel uncomfortable doing these myself (but I'd like to). The electrical is too important to get wrong. I will take it to a shop for that. I need to fix the dryer; namely, check the parts, buy them, and install them.</p><h2 class="">How is your health?</h2><p>It's fine. I'm feeling a bit blue. I'm not sleeping as well as I'd like to. Twice this week I contemplated not getting up, but I decided I should. Normally, I'm happy to spring out of bed to approach the day. I've cut alcohol this week entirely. I think I should use DCK this Sunday.</p><h2 class="">What happened? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?</h2><p>I told my teacher that I was depressed and suicidal last year. I feel vulnerable for saying it. I think people lack empathy. It was probably a mistake.</p><h2 class="">Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technologic, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about what happened? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself.</h2><p>I'm trying to figure out how to explain my existential crisis to others in a sound bite that makes sense. It is very hard for people to empathize with those in psychic pain (it is difficult for them to represent the mental state I'm in while developing a theory of mind). It's just a fact that we otherize people with mental differences that make them sad. What exacerbates the problem are the complex reasons for my crisis. People would be far more hopeless, angry, and depressed if they understood the world as I do. They will not allow themselves to see the truth though. I see the pragmatism of ignorance. </p><p>Ultimately, I think people are evil too. Explaining the redpill to others is too difficult. It is an attack on their fundamental belief system, and hence, an attack on them (beyond just calling them evil to their faces, ofc). They will become so irrationally defensive that they will otherize me. I think I need a way to defuse it. Ugh. It's difficult to show how the pieces fit together to others.</p><h2 class="">What are you going to do about what happened?</h2><p>Basically, I need to develop an existential crisis elevator speech for others. I need to concisely explain it and leave them room to just say &quot;ah, I'm sorry to hear that&quot; without needing to investigate unless they really are intellectually curious. I need a way to cut through the stupidity and psychopathy of the people I meet who are playing a social game with me. At the moment I have this:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I lost faith in God and humanity, and consequently, I lost hope for myself. I lacked purpose and a reason to live. I couldn't take my own life though because my kids need me. So, I'm here to make their lives happy, even if I can't be. I hoping to create more meaning and purpose for myself. I feel like I'm on the right track.
