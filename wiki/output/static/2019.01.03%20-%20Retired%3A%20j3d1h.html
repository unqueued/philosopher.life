And when your surpassing creations find the answers you asked for, you can't understand their analysis and you can't verify their answers. You have to take their word on faith.</p><p>‚Äì Peter Watts, <em>Blindsight</em>
</p></blockquote><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Our%2520Daughter%253A%2520The%2520Designer%2520of%2520Happiness.html">Our Daughter: The Designer of Happiness</a></li></ul><p>My daughter is brilliant<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> and absurdly knowledgeable for her age.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> She is a profound First Born child. It's sometimes scary how much she understands, what she designs, and who she really is. The complexity is enormous to me! I ripped the veil away, forcefed her fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, innocence lost, and baptized her with fire. I have cursed her. I fear my ferocious intensity has damaged her in many ways; I pray I haven't permanently dimmed her beautiful light. I cannot atone for my sins; I can only hope to restore her. </p><p>I'm here to help her make lemonade, navigate those deep waters, and efficiently achieve eudaimonia through persistently wise labor and self-programming. I must guide this prodigy with empathy, to accept her wherever she goes, and to show her that her pain and effort are meaningful and ultimately worthwhile. I hope that one day she will forgive me for not being the creator she needed. Despite my failures, may she succeed in virtue of herself.</p><p>Few children upwardly escape the socioeconomic status and privileges of their parents in the neverending era of hypercompetition and corruption. Perhaps even fewer cross the postmodern threshold with integrity. I do not know if anyone succeeds in navigating the whirlwind of our world. However, I believe my daughter may be an exception to the rule. Behold my broken and perilous mentat <em>Bene Gesserit</em> princess. Whether she quietly hides in plainsight or transforms into a fierce alien empress, I stand behind her.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">nm</sup></button> </p><p>I don't know who she wants to become, but I hope to lay the groundwork for her. I hope to help her: become her own master, to guide herself, to be exceedingly rational in her executive functioning for the sake of happiness. I may not pass into the promised land, but she might. I cannot see the end of the road, but I will give her the means to wander that desert. I seek to equip her for an enemy I do not fully grasp, for a goal-chain that I cannot envision, for a life beyond my understanding.</p><p>As beautiful and powerful as she is, she still has plenty of holes in her game. I am convinced, however, she also has the tools to fill them. I am of use to her, at least for a while yet.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> Admittedly, it is not a question of <em>if</em> she will surpass my theoretical and practical knowledge, only a matter of <em>when</em>. I have the fragments, but she may actually wield them. Depending on her choices, one day she may surpass me to a point so far out of even my reach that we will experience an epistemic singularity, with her on one one side and me on the other, a memetic barrier-seal so profound I will be unable to understand what she sees.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> </p><p>Long ago, I told her I did not have the answer to the <em>moral question</em> and that no human does. I have seen it, naked before me, humanity has failed. It is simply faith. I'm here to help her succeed on her own terms on either side of that great divide. The tools, explanations, and justifications I give her serve her on both sides of the wall, and when I can't do that, I give her two stories to think about. Again, my goal is for her to be happy and enable her to define herself. I hold my breath; let us hope we succeed.</p><hr><h2 class="">Principles:</h2><ul><li>Teach her to design.</li><li>Help her see the objects, structures, and patterns which emerge in and from the world.</li><li>Give her the quantitative and narratival tools for construction and deconstruction.</li><li>Teach her to master herself, self-discipline, forming good habits, working hard, and practicing virtue.</li><li>Equip her with the cognitive socialization instruments, and give her opportunity to practice and develop her affective social skills.</li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Focus:</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Unschool%2520Ideas.html">j3d1h: Unschool Ideas</a></li><li>Books for my daughter:<ul><li>The Unix Programming Environment</li><li>The Little Schemer</li></ul></li><li>Finding out how and when she can audit classes at Milligan</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Computer%2520Science%25206-Year%2520Plan.html">Computer Science 6-Year Plan</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Daily%2520Stack.html">Daily Stack</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Current%2520Stack%2520Example.html">Current Stack Example</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="School%2520Log%2520Templates.html">School Log Templates</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Yearly%2520Plan.html">j3d1h: Yearly Plan</a></li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Vault:</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="%252Fb%252F%2520of%2520Homeschooling%2520of%2520j3d1h.html">/b/ of Homeschooling of j3d1h</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Gameplan%2520for%2520Homeschooling%2520j3d1h%2520v1.0.html">Gameplan for Homeschooling j3d1h v1.0</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Autobackup%2520to%2520USB%2520upon%2520Mounting.html">j3d1h: Autobackup to USB upon Mounting</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Baking%2520Tools.html">j3d1h: Baking Tools</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Computer%2520Wizard.html">j3d1h: Computer Wizard</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Gameplan%2520for%2520Homeschooling.html">j3d1h: Gameplan for Homeschooling</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Getting%2520ethernet%2520to%2520your%2520room.html">j3d1h: Getting ethernet to your room</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Homeschooling.html">j3d1h: Homeschooling</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Make%2520a%2520backup%2520for%2520mom.html">j3d1h: Make a backup for mom</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Reinstall%2520for%2520your%2520mom.html">j3d1h: Reinstall for your mom</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Run%2520an%2520XMPP%2520Server.html">j3d1h: Run an XMPP Server</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h%253A%2520Unschool%2520Ideas.html">j3d1h: Unschool Ideas</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h's%2520Wiki%2520Log.html">j3d1h's Wiki Log</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Planning%2520Future%2520Gameplan%2520for%2520Homeschooling%2520j3d1h.html">Planning Future Gameplan for Homeschooling j3d1h</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Mathematics%2520Tutoring%2520Log.html">Mathematics Tutoring Log</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.10.04%2520-%2520Retired%253A%2520Daily%2520Stack.html">2018.10.04 -
