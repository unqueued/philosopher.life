<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Whitney came late. It was just me setting up today. When she came we talked about her classes. She thinks the kids need to learn how to type. Preach.</p><p>I'm generally assigned to the 5th and 6th graders. Today, with Matt missing for the first hour, Whitney decided to give me the older kids. This is weird. She has been doing this for years. It's like she doesn't make decisions or handle big things. She is eminently a helper (and, lord knows, we all need help). Cool, well I learned the 7-9th (including our high school helpers) names. She took the younger pack.</p><p>Mitchell took the 5th graders, rofl. I'm glad to see the Vice can see what I do. Those kids need more help than the others. </p><p>We sat in class and chilled. 5DM and 8Cf talked with me about games and computers. I explained what I was doing on my phone as I wrote this. We talked about the VPN and my network infrastructure. This is one area in which my daughter is just lightyears ahead of everyone her age. That too shall pass. The other program leaders had no clue what we were talking about, and they don't really care.</p><p>Matt and Whitney took the kids who wanted to watch to ballgame in the gym. I took the cool kids to the computer lab. Fuck yeah.</p><p>I ended up playing a game of &quot;pretend&quot; with 5Hf. What can I say? I don't even do that with my own children. Her name, ofc, is too beautiful to me to deny her the chance. She clearly has no one. Well, I'll do it. It was one of the weirder 15 minutes of my adult life, and I'm glad to be there for her.</p><p>I filled my paperwork out and we left.</p></div>
