Be the architect of this living art and your artful living. Go forth, sir, and be that which creates itself. Build your existential lifetool, reconstruct yourself, and ride your liferaft down the river of happiness.

Aspire to pragmatic perfection for your own sake. Be uncompromisingly wise as you engineer yourself and virtually reap what you sow.</em></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>We first make our habits, and then our habits make us. </p><p>‚ÄìFrederick Langbridge
</p></blockquote><p>This wiki talks to you, h0p3, and you talk to it. Think about your wiki as a <em>computer</em> because: <em>it is</em> and <strong>so are you</strong>. </p><p>Autonomy is reducible to programming yourself. Program yourself by innovatively programming this wiki. As best you can: escape prisons of misery and build a good life for yourself. Positively disintegrate and wisely rebuild yourself. Iteratively reimagine your modus operandi.</p><p>Think of each page on your wiki as a file, and think of your files as containing objects, data structures. Manipulate, create, write, organize, create new words, generate fitting data structures and algorithms, mine yourself, and discover or invent the narratives and patterns in your wiki. Be your own data and computer scientist in your existential investigations and the pursuit of happiness. </p><p>Here you are writing a quantitative guiding light cheatsheet for your life's journey. Be poetically calculating in your planning and execution. Be meta about this wiki and your life. Evolve. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Know%2520Thyself.html">Know Thyself</a> and master your tools until they are extensions of yourself. Wield and shape yourself wisely. Be willing to make mistakes, and remember that science progresses one funeral at a time.</p><hr><h2 class="">Principles:<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button></h2><p>h0p3, it's me, you. Pay attention, self.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> You are an exceedingly complex biological computer system having a carefully crafted conversation with yourself.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> You are an evolving self-programmer. Program this rabbithole and yourself wisely! </p><p>In the long-term, this is the most important page on this wiki, with the shorter-term exception of your boot sector: {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About%252C%2520a.k.a.%2520The%2520Opening%2520of%2520the%2520Rabbit%2520Hole.html">About</a>}. Here you attempt to formalize how you want to program yourself. This platform you are building is for your own knowledge base and systematically shaping yourself. Be creative, and run with it! </p><p>Second order of business: you should write second-personally or first-person-plurally (implying second-personal empathy) in this section as much as you can. Finding the right voice in which to talk to yourself isn't easy, but it's crucial at this level. Pretend an absurdly empathic friend (yourself, obviously) is telling you what you need to know and do.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button></p><p>So, where do you move from the {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About%252C%2520a.k.a.%2520The%2520Opening%2520of%2520the%2520Rabbit%2520Hole.html">About</a>} page? That is quite a narrative. Now you must be quantitative about your qualitative narrative. You must put theory into practice. But, to put it into practice as best as you can, you must develop even more theories. The goal is to be friendly-formal, clarifying, terse, pragmatic, heuristical, empirically data-driven, goal-oriented, coherent, and axiomatically insightful in this section; i.e. you have to actually build it, so do it intelligently.</p><p>This wiki, including this section, is organizationally bootstrapped and constructed piecemeal. It's cobbled together. It's not perfect, and it never will be. But, it can and will improve; you just need to push and hack it together. Do your best. It takes time to engineer and implement a well-oiled existential machine. What is practically ideal in this case, and how do you achieve it as best you can? Go for it!</p><p>The {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Current%2520Focus%2520of%2520h0p3's%2520Wiki.html">Focus</a>} page is deeply interested in computing the contents of your life. Most of the work happens there. But, like your life and this wiki, it needs principles for prioritizing, construction, weighing, and fundamental decision procedures. You need more than plans; you need principles for those plans. You need principles for those principles too, and so on. One must push hard in this direction, however painful and difficult it may be. </p><p>Obviously, {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Current%2520Focus%2520of%2520h0p3's%2520Wiki.html">Focus</a>}, {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Vault%2520of%2520h0p3.html">Vault</a>}, and {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Dreams%2520of%2520h0p3.html">Dreams</a>} must ultimately affect, as a kind of feedback loop, your guiding principles in this section as well as your {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About%252C%2520a.k.a.%2520The%2520Opening%2520of%2520the%2520Rabbit%2520Hole.html">About</a>} page, your existential anchor.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button>  Essentially, be careful in how you grant privilege escalation to lower-ordered processes.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button> However paradoxical it may seem, it's up to you to strike the right balance between guarding yourself and being vulnerable to yourself.</p><p>In this section, you must lay down the constitution, the criterion and source of authority of your internal law: the rules, strategies, methodologies, and principles of programming yourself and using this wiki. Autonomy literally means self-legislating. That's exactly what you intend to do. Here you hope to hone and maximize your executive functioning. Essentially, you need direction in life, and you're helping yourself find and implement the best way you know how (what else can you do, eh?). </p><p>There are many collections of principles worth looking at. You must isolate, categorize, organize, analyze, revise, and synthesize them. Cleanliness, order, and conventions matter. If this wiki is an isomorphically mapped feedback loop, and changes are bi-directional (you change the wiki, and the wiki changes you), then you should take the time to organize and structure it with the right principles. You must unscatter your thoughts. You must be an existential computer scientist in your pursuit of <em>homo sapien</em> happiness; it's the only philosophically practical thing to do. Accumulate virtue-generating idioms and habits. </p><p>You must be meta about being meta, etc., but in a sense, you should aim to do minimal theoretical work in this section.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> You need to be as practical as you can be here, despite how existential and theoretical it really is. If the {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About%252C%2520a.k.a.%2520The%2520Opening%2520of%2520the%2520Rabbit%2520Hole.html">About</a>} page is your existential anchor narrative, a very qualitative and subjective (yet obviously valuable) theory filled with &quot;I&quot; language, then this section is meant to be it's pragmatic brother, filled with &quot;You&quot; advice language and principles for this wiki's self-dialectic.</p><p>Remember that you are in the driver's seat. So, pilot the wiki wisely, ace! Build for yourself a proof of your sanity, growth, intelligence, wisdom, and willpower. Play life and this wiki like a video game that you adore. Be obsessively strategic in your planning and savor the metaliving experience.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button> If you aren't making maximally meta paradigm shifts and syntheses, you're doing it wrong! Pour yourself into this medium. Shotgun approach, organize, and prune in order to find the way to happiness.
