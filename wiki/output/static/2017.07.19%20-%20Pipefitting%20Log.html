<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I showed up at 7, when I clock in basically. I sat in the car reading and writing. Jaye showed up at 7:35, and Terry's crew at 7:50. Jaye and I started putting stuff together while we waited for them. I forgot to lock the box, and I'm so glad I did my perimeter sweep before anyone showed up. I was able to fix this thing before anyone showed up without losing any trust.</p><p>Terry was late because he was bringing our new welding machine (it worked wonders). The guys at the shop weren't bringing it in time, I suppose. We needed it, too. We started hooking it all up. I've used the old welding machine until after break (when they took it) as a power source. I measured out the center-to-center of the underground and chiller &quot;out&quot; pipes. I found out that I'm going straight 90, nipple, to the 90+nipple+flange I made yesterday. I didn't realize that, and I only found out about it after doing the math. Terry clarified it for me. </p><p>I cut the pipe for it, then went on break. Jaye had finished the caps on our 90's. We let them cool while on break. On the break, we talked. Jaye used to be a dealer. I believe this is why he went to prison before. He doesn't put that on his applications. If they find out, they just fire him, and they filter him out if they know in advance. Apparently, Barry and his son (who works at SMS) provide weed to most of the crews. Everyone drinks and uses cannabliss, and some harder drugs, it appears. I'm not surprised. Apparently, they don't test you past the initial job application (for insurance purposes, and I believe that only when it comes to insurance claims or gross negligence do they test you again) and in rare circumstances (you needed to really be irresponsible for them to administer the test to you). I think I'll start using on Saturdays! Daily use is much harder to get out of your system, but single weekly use is much easier (especially for cannabutter). This will be a good balance.</p><p>We finally found out that there is a control valve on both sides. We put a nipple on the 90 with a flange. It is meant to come off the strainer bending toward the inlet pipe of chiller #1.</p><p>Jaye let me weld again today. He holds my hand on the stinger (that could not sound any gayer). He thinks I know nothing, I'm pretty sure. But, after I do it on my own, he has high praise. He feels like a good teacher (even though I could already do what he was showing me). As in, he keeps the weld, and we don't grind it out. I need more practice, of course. I think it would be great to learn this on the job.</p><p>Jaye was supposed to weld this 90 first. I thought he did because he was working on the other one. I went to mount it. Afterward, Terry noticed it wasn't welded on the inside of the flange and that a cap was missing on the outside of the flange. Shit. So, I took it down. Leroy, a helper, old man, helped me. I think he stole my alignment bar! This does not seem like him at all. I am very surprised. Fuck me, I needed it today. </p><p>Anyways, they left, so Jaye finished, we cooled it with water, and mounted it. I think I pissed Jaye off. He kept telling me how to mount the flanges together, and he saw no need for the alignment. He didn't get that we needed to get the hi-los right all around, and he didn't appreciate the order and lack of tooling we had. He then went on to &quot;show me&quot; his star pattern. He went 12-6-1-7-etc. Not a star, bro. I was as humble as I could be in correcting him. I know he's done it a bunch, but he's not doing it correctly. I know I'm new at this, that I know far less total than he does, but there are things I know that he doesn't know. </p><p>We also found out the control valve on it. We were already fairly packed up. We left our tools in the toolroom. Maybe a mistake.</p><p>We ended up moving our workstation 3 times today, twice to get out of the son. We are now in the boiler room with Jacob. They don't push nearly as hard as we do, but they are quite productive. I also found out why they avoid in-position welds so fundamentally: Jacob can't do it. I saw his 2G stringer cap today, and it sucked. I can do better than that, seriously. The boiler room, despite the name, was wildly cooler than the outside. </p><p>My teacher called my wife. It sounds like the conversation went well. My teacher said he found a 4-month job for me at Eastman. It's coming up in a few weeks. I think I should take it if it does. I'm here to acquire experience, as much as possible. Not having to travel would be amazing. </p><p>Amazing news: AB&amp;T said they are buying my tools! This is outstanding! I think it will make my life a lot easier.</p></div>
