<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Freewill debate, yet again. Tremendously convincing argument, as always. I think compatibilism is a confabulation, but it borders on a faith-lie I just want to accept and be done with. But, then you go to trace out to what <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> one is free on sucha  view, and the same problematics ultimately arise. I understand the Zen approach (which I ultimately see as being abused by psychopaths), but I also think that's a beautiful way to conveniently say whatever you want to say to your &quot;illusory&quot; self. If I take <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> to be real, an axiom, and I take myself to be participating in its pursuit (real for me), and since &quot;ought implies can,&quot; then I am free. It's transcendental reasoning (i.e. begging the question, homies). </p><p>What will you do? Both rabbitholes look fucking awful. My brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> would just set it aside and stop looking at it. Maybe that's really the best I can do?</p><p>My huge philosophical out: we are are at least partial unmoved movers in some sense. Do you know how fucking insane that sounds to me now? That was my defense in grad school (until I just felt disillusioned). I have to posit we aren't our brains, which isn't too hard for me. I'm fully willing to accept metaphysics shapes the very nature of &quot;vision&quot; itself. As a transcendental realist, I think we magically access something outside ourselves.</p><p>I agree our selves must be an emergence of two things in dialectic (or more complex). There does appear space to talk about the possibility of an unmoved mover. It's not fashionable to consider metaphysics acting upon physics, but it is clear that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Unmoved%2520Telos.html">The Unmoved Telos</a> does so, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> may force the possibility of some part of my identity having that as well. I do not know what that really means. Yeah, it could just be handwaiving. We're in the depths of the philosophical problem here, to the point that most of academic philosophers I know refuse to even acknowledge this issue directly (it's really unpopular, it's scary, and it's a commitment).</p><hr><p>I'm a pre-lucid dreamer? I'm very often aware of the fact that I am dreaming. I know it's a dream. Unfortunately, I do not experience the full range of ownership, of directing my ray of intentionality, of the feeling of agency in my dreams to most <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>. I don't actually experience the full range of senses; it never feels real enough either. It's not a world anything like conscious, waking life for me. </p></div>
