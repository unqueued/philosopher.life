<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was a good day. I got some studying done for my final exam. Also, Chris told me that the teacher is not prepared for the next book. We'll see. I'll ask to start studying the book anyways. After studying, we started getting the shop ready for mounting the second simulator. We moved the tables, set all the wires, got an air hose set, fixed up the concrete bolts, and slowly took the simulator off its stands. </p><p>Eventually, the teacher took the forklift and raised it up. He can drive it well. I hope to learn how to drive it as well. Eventually, I will ask to build an obstacle course in the parking lot to do it. That would be worth my time. </p><p>They slowly moved it around, got it into position, and then we started leveling. We brought out a giant German hammer drill and made some holes while the simulator was in place. We aired them out, and then we hammered the concrete screws into place. I tightened them up. Everything came out well. </p><p>Luke found the L-shaped (looking down it longways) metal that we cut in several places to fit over both simulators (the other is anchored to the wall). It took a while to clean that up. Luke tacked it, and Nash asked me if he could do some welding (I took some video of it for him). I went back over all the welds though. This time, my welds kicked serious ass. Like, it flaked off nice. More than once I've had good looking welds. I'm pleased by that. </p><p>I cleaned up almost entirely by myself. Eventually, the teacher told us to find all the 3&quot; 150# flanges we could. We found 10. He then told us to create fabrications for the simulator (in as many pieces as we wanted, as long as it was complex). We spent the rest of the time trying to figure out what we wanted to do. We each drew up some plans, but nothing quite worked.</p><p>The big monkey wrench was when I went to measure. The simulators aren't perfect duplicates. In fact, there is 1/16th off on the bottom 3&quot; flanges and possibly 1/4th on the top 3&quot; flanges. I think that means we'll need to redraw because we can't count on them to be perfectly level across the board. We'll figure it out tomorrow. I think we'll do some measurements first, and then we'll plan around it.</p><p>Chris was lazy again today. Maybe something else is wrong with him. I don't know what it is. He's not exactly been himself lately. Or, perhaps this is just part of the continual pattern I have in getting to know people. In almost all cases, the more I get to know someone, the less I like them.</p></div>
