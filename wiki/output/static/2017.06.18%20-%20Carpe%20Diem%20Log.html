<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><ul><li>I woke up at 8ish today. I sat there for a bit. It was nice.</li><li>Fireman time, per my new usual. I don't know why I've switched to/added mornings. What better way to start the day, eh?</li><li>My family went off to church, and I took my DCK. </li><li>I tried to play a game of League before it kicked in. Towards the end, I actually just AFKed and went to lay down.</li><li>I wrote. I was surprisingly lucid although disoriented.</li><li>My meditations were basically completed at about the same time my family came home. We talked.</li><li>We made chili while the kids cleaned the bathrooms.</li><li>Instead of doing schoolwork, I cleaned my kids' room with them. <ul><li>They still need my help, and I'm there to do it. I hope it will just click one day.</li></ul></li><li>I talked with my wife about writing. I think she has something to say. I think this is part of that vocational problem for her. I see it as part of her purpose.</li><li>She took a nap (period, headache talking to me, plus bad weather), and I cleaned. </li><li>We didn't go swimming because it simply got too late. The family meeting matters.</li><li>I surfed some.</li><li>I wrote in my wiki.<ul><li>I may back off using &quot;Bobert&quot; so much since I generally want to be speaking to myself. That said, sometimes I need a different kind of adversary (Samwise Gamgee!).</li></ul></li><li>We read each other's wikis and talked quite a bit. There were several excellent discussions. <ul><li>I'm extremely happy to see that our wikis provide a significant jumping off points for discussion and debate on top of being useful windows into each others' inner lives, etc.</li></ul></li><li>ALM called, but I didn't call him back until later since we were in the middle of our family meeting.</li><li>We did our Family Log<ul><li>It went quite well. </li><li>We considered having a constructive criticism section, and I hope to get there. I don't think we are ready for it. I need more time to reflect on how to implement it wisely and kindly.</li></ul></li><li>My wife went over their school structure while I returned ALM's call.<ul><li>We talked about Hack, Slash, and Crawl.</li><li>We shot the shit about our lives, the wedding, cars, computers, etc.</li><li>He had sent me an e-mail, and I sent one back. Hopefully, we will connect over qTox and Pidgin. </li><li>He may be switching to Linux again. That would be awesome!</li></ul></li><li>I've surfed and wrote a bit while watching TSM destroy nV.</li></ul></div>
