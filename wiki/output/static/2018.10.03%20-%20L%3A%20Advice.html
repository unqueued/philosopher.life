Tue 6:09 PM
 I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by All Quiet... Am I missing something or do you just like to capitalize words?
15 hours ago
 Side note: I know this is super out of left field, but... I think I agree with [[JRE]] that it may not be safe to contact ?[[MWF]]? &amp; [[SLT]]. Especially if they are spreading false word that you‚Äôre selling. I don‚Äôt know how many people they‚Äôve told in passing as a ‚Äúwarning‚Äù or what... but, I don‚Äôt think it will end well. I‚Äôve had passing thoughts that they seem to have reached the point of no return on their end. But I also don‚Äôt talk to them that often and have a limited view altogether anyways.

 Thank you for thinking about it for me. I really appreciate it.
14 hours ago
 Oooooh
14 hours ago
 And, no problem. I honestly wish I had more insight on the whole situation for you...
14 hours ago
 It troubles me that they would make such a strong accusation like that.
14 hours ago
 AND tell people about it.
14 hours ago
 That is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm glad I had a sanity check with my advisers.
14 hours ago
 It does appear they wish to sever the relationships/responsibilities and simply visit when once in a while when it is convenient to them to maintain to appearance that they care.
14 hours ago
 They have almost retired from the family.
14 hours ago
 my grammar is extra bad lately
14 hours ago
 I'm fairly sure they are in damage control mode to maintain their social capital.
14 hours ago
 Perhaps...
14 hours ago
 I personally find that very frustrating. It feels less like we‚Äôre family and more like they‚Äôre just using us...
14 hours ago
 Speaking of, has my mom responded to you yet?
14 hours ago
 She has not, but she has as long as she wants. Plus, I took forever to respond to her (so, I'd have no room to talk anyways).
14 hours ago
 Fair.
14 hours ago
 My tired brain is everywhere this morning and it reminded me of something she said while we were talking about your letter
14 hours ago
 She mentioned that she never understood why you were of the mindset you have in regards to your parents... said that she and ?[[MWF]]? went through much worse as kids.
14 hours ago
 Which is a bold statement to me. I think there‚Äôs a lot I don‚Äôt know about here.
14 hours ago
 aye
14 hours ago
 I don‚Äôt doubt the stories I‚Äôve heard from you and [[JRE]]. But mom never really told me much about her childhood... just that it was awful and she used school as an escape.
14 hours ago
 Grandma Mary has told me a LOT about her childhood with Grandpa ?[[MWF]]? but idk how much of it is true and how much of it is twisted memories.
14 hours ago
 Maybe we should all just take your advice and write everything down... lol
14 hours ago
 Sorry. [[j3d1h]] asked giant questions, and it took me a long time to answer them.
13 hours ago
 It is true that watching the older generations has made it clear to me that I must write it down.
13 hours ago
 No worries!
13 hours ago
 My brother recently needed to create a timeline of this year because he couldn't remember it. He used my wiki and his bank statements to recreate it.
13 hours ago
 Interesting.
13 hours ago
 I read about that some and was confused ‚Äî makes sense in context now
13 hours ago
 I don‚Äôt think the comparison my mother makes is fair though... but I can‚Äôt really say I know better.
13 hours ago
 I'm not sure if she understands the nature of morality. To whom much is given, much is required. I understand she had it worse and less to work with, which is why I hold her to far lower standards than I hold myself. I'm also not convinced she is honest with herself, including about her own parents.
13 hours ago
 Her lack of understanding of my context is non-trivial, of course. She could have asked. =)
13 hours ago
 Yeah...
13 hours ago
 True. And she may. I hope she does.
13 hours ago
 It‚Äôs not really my place to correct her because I don‚Äôt know the whole situation of either.
13 hours ago
 Perhaps. Though, no one does. I take it you feel like you don't have a sufficient degree of knowledge to make such a move.
13 hours ago
 I hope she spends some time understanding the structure of the wiki.
13 hours ago
 A lot of people only look at New/Recent, but never actually understand how the pieces come together.
13 hours ago
 Guilty.
13 hours ago
 But I like to dive in face first sometimes.</code></pre></div>
