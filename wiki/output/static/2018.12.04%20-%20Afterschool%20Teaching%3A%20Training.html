<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Sonya called just now. My paperwork went through. Yay. I have training this week.</p><hr><p>Ah, bureaucracy, smells like taint.</p><p>Accutrain Vidyas:</p><ol><li>Its Up to You (Bloodborne Pathogens)</li><li>Playground Safety (Making the Grade)</li><li>Your Right to Know (chemical hazards)</li><li>Suicide Prevention</li><li>Sexual Harassment in Schools</li><li>Food Allergies and Anaphylaxis</li><li>Its About Respect</li><li>Child Abuse Recognition</li></ol><p>These videos are exactly what you'd expect.</p><p>They have no interest in you following these videos when it comes to safety. They want a policy that foists the legal responsibility onto you while punishing you for ever actually following these rules to the letter.</p><p>You can't change view speed or turn CC on. You can't skip through the vidya. I don't know if I'm allowed to fail the quizzes. We'll find out! Just going to take the quizzes and at least appear to watch vidya incase it flags in the system. </p><p>They literally hand you an image of a certificate (Daria, help me!) with your name and the title of the course printed on it plus a percentage grade. That's it. I'm supposed to print that out and hand it to Sonya? What's the point of the database if we are doing this through paperwork (as though she doesn't have access to this information). This is forgeable. This is stupid.</p><p>My daughter laughed and said it was wildly inconsistent that they would have someone watch me pee for the drug test, but policy is rubberstamped and not administered with any accountability. The difference between the liability is clear. The goal is disturbing. It's just &quot;we told you,&quot; and that's all they are worried about. As usual, they are just trying to cover their butts; truth and effectiveness are irrelevant. I hate people.</p><p>Alright, these quizzes are common sense. I can't click through to the quiz since that is blocked. I'm going to take the risk of just muting and working on other stuff until it's over. I'll take the quiz then.</p></div>
