<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Psalm 13 is the song of an individual in pain; he is staring death in the face. His case is the classic example of suffering, and the response of the faithful. Psalm 13 is the short and effective lament of an individual. </p><p>The basic form of a lament of the individual is: (a.) the complaint, (b.) the appeal, and (c.) the expression of confidence in G-d’s help. Psalm 13 follows this form. Verses 1-2 form the complaint, while verses 3-4 compose the appeal, leaving verses 5-6 as the expression of confidence in G-d’s help.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>How long, O Lord? Wilt Though forget me forever?</p><p>How long wilt Though hide Thy face from me? (NASB Psalm 13:1)
</p></blockquote><p>The first verse of Psalm 13 leads the reader to believe that, “[G-d] may simply have forgotten,” or even worse that, “[G-d] has intentionally turned away,” indicative of the wrath of G-d (Keck 726). The phrase “’How long?’, is a biblical formula for fright and exasperation, [which] demands an explanation from the provident G-d appears to have allowed chaos and suffering rather than order and blessing. Verse 3a can be translated, ‘How long do I lay up counsel in my heart,’ as though to say, ‘must I keep on learning forever from my pain?’”(Mays 439). The word “eternally” or “forever” in the first line of verse one may have two meanings. The first meaning is the possibility of G-d continually ignoring the prayer of the psalmist and the other concerns being “forever cut off from [G-d’s] remembrance and love (Dahood 76).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>How long shall I take counsel in my soul,</p><p>Having sorrow in my heart all the day?</p><p>How long will my enemy be exalted over me? (NASB Psalm 13:2)
</p></blockquote><p>Verse 2 is more focused on the psalmist. It is traditionally suggested that the psalmist was seriously ill and facing imminent death as found in verses 1-2 (Keck 726).  Who is the enemy? The enemy could represent a person or group of people, or maybe the enemy is to be understood as death.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Consider and answer me, O Lord, my G-d;</p><p>Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death. (NASB Psalm 13:3)
</p></blockquote><p>The appeal asks for an answer, “the request that [G-d] ‘answer’ is particularly appropriate, since the complaint in v1-2 was framed as a series of questions” (Keck 727). The NIV’s “look” may be more accurate than the NRSV’s and NASB’s “consider;” “the request calls for [G-d] to reverse the action of hiding G-d’s face.” Without intervention, the psalmist will surely die. The psalmist requests that G-d turn his face towards the psalmist (look) and intervene in this injustice (answer). The phrase “Enlighten my eyes” may have a two-fold meaning. The first “phrase means ‘to restore to health,’” while the second “may denote ‘to grant immortality,’ since ‘to see the light’ is idiomatic for ‘to enjoy immortality’” (Dahood 77). The psalmist knows he is near death; the phrase “Lest I sleep the sleep of death” is best taken as a physical reference to death (Buttrick 73). </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him,”</p><p>Lest my adversaries rejoice when I am shaken. (NASB Psalm 13:4)
</p></blockquote><p>Although in verse 2 and the first line of verse 4 we find “enemy,” verse 4b refers to “adversaries” in plural, “suggesting human enemies who will rejoice over the psalmist’s defeat or demise” (Keck 727). The reader struggles with the reference to this enemy or these enemies. Does enemy represent moral evil, death, a person or persons against the psalmist, or even his affliction? The phrase “when I am shaken” is also interpreted as “when I stumble.” These have many “connotations; here it connotes stumbling into the jaws of death” (Dahood 78). This “stumbling into the jaws of death” may give be indicative of the identity of the enemy: death. Although the meaning of enemy and adversaries is significant to this psalm, we may never actually know for sure what the psalmist meant.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But I have trusted in Thy loving kindness;</p><p>My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation.</p><p>I will sing to the Lord,</p><p>Because He has dealt bountifully with me. (NASB Psalm 13:5-6)
</p></blockquote><p>Verses 5-6 compose the lament. The psalmist jumps from expressions death and enemies immediately into expressions of trust and praise of kindness. This transition is rather abrupt and unexpected. Certainly the reader is slightly deterred by the psalmist’s immediate progression into the praise of the Lord. Did the author mean for this contrast to stand out so clearly? If the contrast was meant to be so clear to the reader, then the reader might be forced to reckon with the possibility that all people may experience suffering and are still expected to have a constant faith in G-d. The psalmist’s trust seems to be ongoing; “trust is properly directed to the fundamental attribute of [G-d’s] character: ‘steadfast love’” (Keck 727). Another interesting contrast is when we find that although “the enemy had been ‘exalted over me,’ now [G-d] has ‘dealt bounty over me,’” forming a parallelism.</p><p>Psalm 13 is rather ambiguous in terms of what the author felt towards G-d. The psalmist jumps from questioning G-d to praising G-d indefinitely. The reader is left wondering why the author poses these bi-polar claims within four verses of each other. Does this psalm justify a concurrent questioning and praising of G-d? The purpose of this particular psalm may be more than to simply express suffering and a desire for intervention, but may also serve as an exemplary mindset for those in suffering. When we suffer we are still to believe and praise G-d, for G-d’s ways are not our ways, suffer and believe. Psalm 13 is a good example of simultaneous complaint and praise of G-d during a period of suffering.</p><p>A historical strength of Psalm 13 has been the sheer simplicity of the poetry. Psalm 13 is boldly honest, concluding in positive expressions. Obviously applicable, this chapter speaks to those who feel temporarily abandoned by G-d. Although the psalmist begins to harbor doubts about the goodness of G-d, his confidence prevails, promising to praise G-d for deliverance from death. The chapter reflects the psalmist’s anxiety from G-d’s apparent apathy or anger. Does the psalmist suffer because of his enemies, or because death has chosen him, or because G-d has forgotten him, or because G-d is punishing him? The psalmist’s case and question is timeless. His brief psalm is an excellent example of enduring question of why G-d would and could let suffering and evil exist.</p><hr><p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p><p>Buttrick, George. <em>The Interpreter’s Bible: Vol. IV.</em> Abingdon Press.
