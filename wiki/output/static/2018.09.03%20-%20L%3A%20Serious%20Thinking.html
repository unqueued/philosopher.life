<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hey <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a>. Woke up early again today and can‚Äôt shut my mind off so I‚Äôm going to blabber at you in hopes that you‚Äôll read it when you get the chance.</p><p>I‚Äôve had a lot of things happen this week that I think you‚Äôd be interested in hearing. 
</p></blockquote><p>Awesome. I'm always interested, and I am here to listen. I'll think with you the best I can. I suspect you already anticipate what I'm thinking, but I'm going to say it anyways.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>First, I met with some of my college friends for the first time in nearly half a year and it was really nice. Well, it was also a slap in the face ‚Äî but the good kind people need very now and then. My friends talked seriously with me about getting back into engineering and how transferable my current work skills would be. They‚Äôve told me what to focus on in interviews and encouraged me to get my EIT to show employers that I am taking this whole engineering thing seriously. It was sweet how concerned they are for me... it‚Äôs clear they can tell I‚Äôm not happy with my job right now. The whole time they were talking I heard your voice in my head encouraging me to step away from Humana and back to engineering. Later that night I ended up crying out of frustration... I think somewhere along the line I convinced myself that I wasn‚Äôt good enough to be an engineer. I‚Äôd become scared of the prospect of even attempting an interview. And here I‚Äôd thought that I‚Äôd overcome my low self esteem problem... guess not.
</p></blockquote><p>Those are some good friends. I'm sorry it felt like a slap in the face (even if it's the good kind). They clearly believe in you too. Your MBA has probably set you up well for this, so I may not be of much use to your other than telling you the truth:</p><h2 class="">YOU CAN DO IT! I know you can; you do too.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t</sup></button></h2><p>You aren't happy with your job, and you shouldn't be. Don't take the convenient route. This isn't a platitude: you have exactly one life to spend. Go get what you really want. This isn't even a major risk either; the stones are all there to step on. The door has not shut on you. Your experience really is an asset, and if you are being honest with yourself, you know you can do this too. </p><p>I have no idea if this will be of any help to you (it hasn't helped me yet<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">y</sup></button>): <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Interviewing.html">Interviewing</a>. I've written my own answers (which may be all wrong), but I think you'd feel more confident in putting in this legwork on top of mock interviews. Your friend may be able to assist you there as well; I don't know. </p><p>I'm not sure what books you need for EIT exam(s). In fact, there may be lots of materials you need. Please give me a list of books, applications, curriculum to acquire for you.</p><p>I'm a broken record.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">i</sup></button> I strongly suggest recording this in a journal, organizing it, and...Tiddlywiki is the best tool for the job!  If you want to improve your self-esteem, then appropriately virtue signal to at least yourself in private. Prove it to yourself.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Secondly, all this week I have been wrapped up in roleplaying with the players from the game <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="K.html">K</a> and I co-DM. I don‚Äôt remember how much I‚Äôve told you about it, but basically we allow the players to act as themselves and go about their business throughout the ‚Äúhomebase‚Äù city we‚Äôd created for them. It‚Äôs proven a HUGE success as our players really seem to enjoy it. I personally have enjoyed it far more than I ever expected to. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been doing when I got home this week, which means I should set myself boundaries so I don‚Äôt get carried away. I‚Äôm fairly sure you knew most of that but I wanted to cover it again just in case so what I‚Äôm saying makes sense. </p><p>The interesting part is this: I have found myself in a ‚Äúteaching‚Äù position for the first time as a DM. One of our players struggles to convey his meaning through words even more so than the rest of my engineer friends. This player has found his character pursued romantically by an NPC and has played his PC as if she were very oblivious to the advances. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt just his character, it was actually him that was oblivious. So we had a serious talk about the intentions conveyed by the NPC through their actions and why it was clear to all the other players that this NPC was interested in the PC. It reminded me of what <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a> once said that D&amp;D was used as a tool to teach the more socially inept how to properly behave/interact with others.
</p></blockquote><p>I've been fascinated to hear about your DND games. As I've said, Co-DMing sounds like fun. I wish I could be there one day to watch and ask questions. I also agree theory of mind development through the simulated world created by group story-telling is valuable. This reminds me of a set of books I use with my son for overcoming some of the disadvantages of autism. </p><p>I'm not convinced I've really learned much from DND socially, but I may be a very poor student. To be clear, I've always been oblivious about that sort of thing, including my wife's advancements. She openly flirted with me in classes to the point that all the other students joined in on the game. I had no idea. Lol. My rTPJ just doesn't work like that. I think I can cognitively appreciate it as a 3rd party, but 1st-personally I don't have enough time to see it all. I hope it will be a teaching tool for my children.</p><p>I challenge your notion of &quot;properly&quot; here. Again, there is a difference between the moral law and social convention. I think it is absolutely crucial you continuously make the distinction everywhere in life, even in games.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">w</sup></button> I do not think it is necessarily a good thing to be socially adept; it's a two-edged sword in my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="gfwiwcgws.html">gfwiwcgws</a> considerations. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Thirdly, and I‚Äôm certain you know this, but I had a conversation with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a> about books and research and the like. She was very helpful and has given me a hearty list of books to read. It seems none of them are very expensive either, which is good because I‚Äôd prefer to have my own paper copy I can carry around and markup. I‚Äôm wondering if <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a> is the kind of person that wouldn‚Äôt mind me blabbing to her about what I‚Äôve read and help me digest it a little more.
</p></blockquote><p>She'll be embarrassed that you even had to ask since this is her vocation! Of course you should talk to her about it. It's not blabbing. You're looking at the core of our identities in this kind of work.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">k0sh3k</sup></button></p><p>We write about our books, and you should consider it too. This is how I do it: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Deep%2520Reading.html">Deep Reading</a>. It's an integral part of the process of digesting together.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Oh, and lastly... I haven‚Äôt heard from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> in awhile and I‚Äôm hesitant to reach out to him. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="K.html">K</a> has attempted some contact with him but it hasn‚Äôt really gotten anywhere. I‚Äôm reading from your wiki that he‚Äôs been struggling a lot lately and I wonder if that is much of the reason for it. I‚Äôm very hesitant to reach out to him only because I don‚Äôt really know how to handle delicate situations like this... but perhaps I‚Äôm just being a coward again.
</p></blockquote><p>I don't think you should hesitate. Except for gracefully attending to Rebecca's needs, I don't think this is a delicate situation.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button> He may be too polite or ashamed to share his pain. You know the truth though. He's being burned alive in slow motion. I know he could use the support. In your shoes, I'd connect with both of my brothers. I'm just outright envious that you all get to live next to each other. I don't understand why you all aren't closer (which I've said to each of you).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I think that‚Äôs all I have for now. Feel free to respond to all this in whatever way you see fit. I think this is the equivalent of your wiki-based letters at this point. And all on my phone no less. That thumb workout tho.
</p></blockquote><p>It is a letter! I'm glad you wrote it. I think I would be far too frustrated trying to write it out on a phone (and I have a folding bluetooth keyboard, and my case has a stand). It's not just that I can't type fast enough on the phone. I can't edit, revise, and shift around effectively on it. </p><p>You know, I've had students write 10-page papers on their phones. That blows my mind. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Actually, I lied: one last last thing. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt make time to talk to you this week. I have been losing myself in the roleplaying lately and honestly haven‚Äôt made time to talk to many of my friends... it‚Äôs a very poor excuse for ultimately the misuse of my time, but I realize now it likely comes of as me ignoring you. I actually think about you all every day I just don‚Äôt often say anything about it. Perhaps I should just message you when you cross my mind from now on.
</p></blockquote><p>Don't worry about it. I throw myself into many rabbitholes, and I have no room to speak in this regard. And, heck yeah, you should message us for anything. I think being able to talk about any old thing, including the mundane or random, is part of a good friendship.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">a : </span> You probably knew I was going to say that too, lol...and this, and...=)</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">t : </span> And, of course, I arrogantly hold my claim to knowledge in high regard.
