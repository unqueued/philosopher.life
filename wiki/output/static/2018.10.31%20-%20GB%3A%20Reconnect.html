<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>Been thinking about you. Hope life is going well for you, [[GB]].

Hey [[h0p3]]! How are you doing??

I'm doing well enough. Living in TN, raising my kids.

How about you?

Also, if you are down for it:

Let's use this to chat:

SIGNAL LINK

K I cant set that up at the moment though

Not a problem. Happy to talk however you can.

How's life treating you?

Meh lol. Was in a relationship for 4 years. We just broke up about a month and a half ago.

That's awful. I'm sorry.

Yeah it's been kind of a crazy time.

I was actually going to ask about that, but now I do not want to cause you pain.

How are things going for you?

Trying to figure life and the world out. Slowly losing my mind, ha.

Lord do I hear you on that

I took a break from school. Went into pipefitting and welding.

How is that?

About what you'd expect. Union is practically dead here. It is a different world to navigate for me. I like building things.

Gives me a chance to think and work. I'm not done with philosophy.

Been obsessively pouring myself into a piece of art for couple years.

How's academia treating you?

What have you been working on?

Yeah I'm sure things would be a lot better with a union. But I wouldn't hold my breath on that lol

I'm working on Hegel and Heidegger these days. in my diss I'm drawing some parallels between them to address the sort of stuff McDowell's work touches on

That sounds excellent. I'd be interested to read what you have to say. 

Your ratemyprofessor comments are hilarious, btw.

Ignore the cancer.

You still playing MTG? What do you do with your precious freetime these days?

Do you still play?

Nope. Lol. I have no idea what's going on in the MTG world.

I know they banned top from legacy

/tears

I've been considering getting back into WoW to play with family. Kids and cousins can connect that way. haven't been much into gaming these past couple years.

How about you?

Or, if I am playing a game, it's the game of life, hehe.

Lol that game's no good. Life, not wow

I play some eq emu

I played that (emu, not live) again last year for a week. Played on the leetsauce server designed for mq2 botting. Addictive!

That game owns me when I play it. You are one of the few EQ players I've met.

(Dozens of us)

Yeah, it's bad lol. I go through phases where I swear it off and then start again

West World, the show, brings me back to gaming in EQ quite a bit.

Does it? I never made that connection

In a general way, in the way we use the medium to tell ourselves the stories of who we are, or something like that. Might not be an important connection.

EQ is immersive to me.

Have to claw my way back out of that experience machine.

Ha that's exactly what it is lol.

So you giving candy, at a party, or what you up to tonight?</code></pre></div>
