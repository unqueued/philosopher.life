<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I fixed the valves (made them all pretty-ish). I also measured the simulator and drew up the materials list for another one. I went on to double check Chris' math; he made several errors (had to restart twice). We essentially built two rolling offset constructs today. I didn't push as hard (although, I still did the lion's share of the work). I had built them before, and I wanted to let Chris get more practice in. The teacher needed to see that Chris could do it on his own. Ultimately, however, when it came to measuring the degrees and lengths, I stepped in to get it done right. </p><p>They both wanted to know if we would be moving onto socket welds after this. We should. I said I wasn't sure though. I know I went through several offset constructions that Chris and Nash haven't. One or two of them were fairly tricky. I didn't want to ruin the surprise for them, just in case, our teacher slings it at them as well.</p><p>Funnily enough, the teacher did not perform the 90-degree rotation of the object to check both roll and rise. We had been down this road before though, and he knew he could not answer why it would be off. It's okay. After having mounted this stuff, I'm thinking it will be okay for now. There is some wiggle room. </p><p>Afterward, we studied for the exam. It was kind of a brief day. I learned very little, but I was happy to have the opportunity to practice and review. Hopefully, it is crystallizing for me in my virtue-theoretic Fastmind.</p></div>
