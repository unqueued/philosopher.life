<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My brother called me. He's buying wood and tools. I'm excited to see what he builds. He got some purpleheart, though my googling does not demonstrate it is purple to me (I'm colorblind). That thing I sent him is the wrong the way to do it. He also can't spend his body on making lumber, and that makes sense.</p><p>McManus wasn't the destroyer he was hoping for. I can see that. McManus' style is purposely dishonest, rhetorical, etc. It was no nail in the coffin (though damning, yes). I'm glad he looked though. That's cool.</p><p>Raylan has been actin' up after getting his shots. They went to a pumpkin patch: which is what people do. Haha. =) I did not utter &quot;sounds like fun,&quot; and my brother knew that immediately, lol. He's givin' this kid who comes from nothing a home and he's been a dad to him. He's a good man, and it has been a tribulation.</p><p>We talked about friendship. I still don't know how to respond to Aristotle. My brother asked excellent questions, and I fear I could offer no good reasons. My brother is right without even having to say it: I have no idea what real friendship actually means in the end. I feel like I know some necessary aspects or some really valuable aspects even, but I don't know what is sufficient. As usual, my brother walked me through it, wrestled. MB and Graham were two contrastable/comparable examples. We considered some of my brother's friendships as well. I know my brother is my friend. If I'm not helping someone, I guess that's who I'm looking for in a friend: people like my brothers, my children, and my wife (which isn't to say I'm looking past these people!). </p></div>
