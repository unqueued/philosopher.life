To do it in public is morally valuable because deconstructing and constructing yourself out in the open casts some sunlight on the process (keeping us out of temptation, in some cases).</p><p>I like that other people can get a very palpable view of who I am through my site (if they wish to invest the time). If you really want to know who I am, you can know (it‚Äôs been a very useful tool in my life).</p></blockquote><p>Ok, here we go. Hello my friend.</p><p>It is a real surprise to get a note from you. Frankly, I‚Äôm blown away by what you‚Äôre doing‚Äîand I felt that you were deeply embedded somewhere in your wiki, not exactly reaching out to pass notes. But I‚Äôm so glad.</p><p>The representation you‚Äôve chosen for yourself is no illusion. If all I see of someone is pictures and quips, the image of that person is just a bit of shattered glass. But one thousand words cannot lie. They may be untrue, but they divulge so many more triangles to build that person with.</p><p>I am reluctant to say that even a verbose persona can ever be accurate, though. We start to believe that these pixels are us. I think they are just a good show. We are always in public here. And our souls know it.</p><p>I do look forward to the good show you have going. (Likewise: to you out there reading‚Äîhark, reader!‚Äîwe are looking for you. Please read h0p3‚Äôs Find the Others as proof.)</p><p>I like what you are doing; my quest differs. I‚Äôm not looking for an ennobled species of thinker. I don‚Äôt want to avoid the unsavories. I am looking for Anyone. This is not right‚Äîthere are plenty of Anyone‚Äôs around, aren‚Äôt there? Well, I am wanting to fall into fate, rather than to find only my most meaningful bosom friend. I want to travel down the river and stop at all the places that happen to be there along the way. And maybe a friend will crop up. Strange things, images and tales, too.</p><blockquote><p>I am sold on it myself. I know I can communicate who I am, what I‚Äôm thinking, etc. with very low friction on my own medium-turf. My message integrates well into my identity when I use my own tools.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, well, this is quite stunning actually. There is a sense on your wiki of a full use of hypertext that I haven‚Äôt seen before. It is the complexity of your organization and nomenclature. It is somehow still inviting. You have made a journal that is a vast puzzle.</p><p>I have been working, privately, on a directory of the web from a certain vantage. (I don‚Äôt know that my role is to journal; more, to explore out there.) And I think the real key that has been missing‚Äîfrom directories, wikis and engines‚Äîis artistry. To make it beautiful and elegant. Your work is a brilliant stone in that respect. Anyway, (hark, reader,) I‚Äôll stop there.</p><p>Well, this will be fruitful. Feel no pressure to find some technology to make a connection with me. Climb down. We can link just fine.
