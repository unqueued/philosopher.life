<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>As I've noted elsewhere, I didn't take DCK because I was traveling. It literally takes my entire morning. I would be willing to use at my brother's house, but I didn't think it would be the wise thing to do. We had to travel back, and I wanted to be in good shape for driving in case my wife needed me to do so. </p><p>Below you will find my DCK Meditations:</p><hr><p>I'd like each person in the family to come up with a day-long activity for us to do together (or perhaps a list of activities). Eventually, I'd like for us to do something on each person's list.</p><p>What would mine be?</p><ul><li>Canoeing </li><li>Theme Park (maybe should wait until everyone is tall enough)</li><li>Visiting Washington D.C. for a weekend.</li></ul><p>We need to develop plans and dreams together. What do we want to achieve and experience? I could do it all, and that's fine. I think your buy-in matters. I want you to steer the ship too.</p><hr><p>I hope that I will look at non-school environments as learning opportunities and places for growth. This, of course, has to be balanced against financial planning and our well-being. I'm still holding my breath about the union job. I'd like to work before then, but the pieces aren't falling into place. Maybe I need make them fall into place.</p><hr><p>I hope not to wrestle today. Struggling sucks. At least it doesn't feel like being powerless entirely though. I'm struggling with myself and the universe, but it doesn't feel insidious or torturous. The inability to escape pain produces learned helplessness.</p><p>What is the opposite of wrestling? That's what I want to do. It is hard to see what doesn't include wrestling and struggling. Maybe that's just the nature of the honest effort.</p><hr><p>I hope that I can describe and highlight the Platonic Allegory to my children. Reality really is fuzzy and difficult to understand. Striving is all we can do. </p><hr><p>Closed eye visual started out more strongly today. I haven't used in 2 weeks. Let it flow.</p><hr><p>I see us as bumping against things which give us pleasure and pain. Many algorithms emerge and die off. I want to make sure that my children don't feel cast out into the world without any experience or guidance. They have to get their hands dirty. They have to take some risks, fail sometimes, and stand back up. This is about developing not only the right character but also having the right kind of grid or matrix of the world in their mind. They have to anticipate what's coming at them. They have to ride the waves and currents. They have to know when to fight and when to flee. They have to know where to strike with their daggers in the world and when, and why, etc.</p><hr><p>I must admit there is a weird tension I cannot resolve. I want to give my children the independence to become who they want to be. I don't know when the fledgling bird is ready to fly through. I don't even know what counts as good flying or safe enough flying. I do want to shape them into someone who is good and happy though, by my standards or better.</p><hr><p>I feel like the hard and soft divide in my bed is a terrifying symbol. Maybe this is hocus-pocus. Maybe it is Freudian. Maybe it is nothing. I miss the days when I could turn over and hold my wife on equal ground. I want us to be at the same elevation. In time, we will find a mattress which solves the problem. Maybe it doesn't fix the symbolic problem, but money can find a mattress which is flat and perfect for both of us. We spend many years of our lives on the mattress. I do buy that argument. </p><p>Financial pressures have certainly been on my wife. Now it is my turn. I hope to do her justice. I hope to show her that we have not wasted our time and that this story has a happy ending. I feel like I keep gearing up and readying myself to take the big swing, but I feel like I've not taken the swing into financial security. This, of course, is not all my fault. The economic climate is not simple (understatement). But, I want to make sure I'm not holding myself back.</p><hr><p>I wish to inspect gift-giving, yet again. The sinews of the tension between altruism and egoism string out. </p><hr><p>Why does it feel like DCK isn't fully hitting me today? I've felt like that a couple times actually. It doesn't destroy me.</p><p>I am not convinced DCK is helping me today. Does it right my world? Does it work? Do I pass through fires and emerge as a better person on the other side? Ah. Maybe.</p><p>My hope is that there will be a time when I lose doses of DCK are irrelevant and unnecessary. I want to be unified, happy, and functioning enough to not rely upon anything. I want unconditional happiness.</p><p>I'm not even feeling the effects very much today. Or am I? I feel incredibly stable despite the drowsiness that usually accompanies it. I can type. I feel very much like myself. I am me. The dissociative aspect does not seem to be working in full force. If it is working I think it is in tiny ways, opening a door here and there, allowing me to channel a thought I did not anticipate. Obviously, I couldn't write like this permanently. It does have some effect. I feel clear in some respects.</p><p>Not all DCK trips are going to be the same. Remember that. This is incredibly messy. Temper and buffer your expectations. </p><hr><p>Sometimes I imagine raising children like growing flowers (this is a fairly common theme in literature, I'm sure). My wife thinks she is bad at growing flowers. I do not have the virtuous perception and attention to detail that she does (which isn't to say she is virtuous here, but to say that she is clearly more skilled at it than I am). That doesn't mean I shouldn't try to grow flowers, of course. It's about being economical and divvying up with work according to our comparative advantages. </p><hr><p>Ah, I feel the pain now. The pressures of this drug on my brain, I fear, mimic the pressures in my mind. 
 
Sometimes I feel like I'm forced to write out the schematic of the organic journey I am taking. </p><hr><p>It kills me that I am not compatible with my parents. I am not good with theories of minds. Right now, I feel like they feel like they are dying (although, not anymore, possibly) and estranged by some demons or evils of persons interfering in their happiness, health, relationships, etc. (rest assured, they have an exceedingly complex and coherent point of view; they are extremely intelligent creatures). I may have overreacted to my mother's illness. I may not have either. It isn't clear what will unfold. The evidence was there though, I was convinced she was dying. The transformation to frailty was eye-opening. I am more than happy to be wrong. </p><p>There is this weird problem where your adversary appears omniscient but admits they aren't. There is something logical and deeply illogical here. Fog.</p><p>The loss of innocence is tremendous. I must not accept my father's clich√© hatred of the clich√©. I think, at the moment, I don't know what I think. Brainfart. Honesty. These are the psychological cracks. </p><p>Ah, you too see the incoherence of my writing. What are the missing puzzle pieces? I feel pain in my stomach.</p><hr><p>Am I building a new consciousness through DCK? I take myself to be doing something in that ballpark. How, how, and how? In the various kinds, orders, and degrees I do not know. </p><hr><p>Mobile computing wins because people don't know how or won't learn how and won't exert fitting market forces to decentralize and control their own data, networks, and other infrastructure.
 
‚Äî</p><p>I guess I approach DCK like a rodeo. There is a danger, power over myself, and perception to be harnessed and controlled. I feel like I have to bring order to the chaos of the phenomenological experience (which maybe sounds incoherent, but I don't even know what to call it).</p></div>
