THU 2:06 PM
:face_with_finger_covering_closed_lips:
THU 2:07 PM
I must save you!
THU 2:07 PM
Lol.
THU 2:07 PM
Please!!!
THU 2:07 PM
They are always so loud....
THU 2:07 PM
They teach us how to choose our outgroups wisely and praise our ingroups for only the most rational reasons too.
THU 2:08 PM
:tada:
THU 2:08 PM
The loudness causes my ear to literally be in pain. I have to cover my left ear in such cases. I can't do loud noise (especially person based) anymore.
THU 2:09 PM
I'm doing okay. Working through [[Seeking Sphygmus]] and a [[Link Log]] devoted to https://href.cool/ from [[kickscondor]]. I haven't given him a systematic account of his work yet, so I wanted to do that.
THU 2:09 PM
Yeah I am ok at a concert (sometimes) and then with ear plugs...maybe I should get some for here!
THU 2:09 PM
Now is Sphygmus ‚Äúthat boy‚Äù?
THU 2:10 PM
I have these over ear protectors from a previous job that are amazing. They are designed to stack plug inside too (some of my jobs are required both).
THU 2:10 PM
That‚Äôs what [[UJ]] calls any male around our girls...
THU 2:11 PM
Ooooo those sound nice!
THU 2:11 PM
No, she's a good friend of mine I'm rapidly getting to know:https://philosopher.life/#Sphygmus:Sphygmus
THU 2:11 PM
Ahhh ok
THU 2:11 PM
That works ‚ÄîI shall read more
THU 2:11 PM
I have sent my letter to that manboy (apparently, he has been following my drafting): https://philosopher.life/#2019.01.22%20-%20j3d1h%3A%20Entity%3A%20First%20Contact
THU 2:12 PM
How‚Äôs [[JRE]]?
THU 2:12 PM
Bells Palsy
THU 2:12 PM
Yeah Stephen, Mary and Gma Lois have all had it
THU 2:12 PM
He's had a good attitude for a crappy thing in his life. =(
THU 2:12 PM
It‚Äôs painful
THU 2:12 PM
I didn't know that.
THU 2:13 PM
It seems reasonably possible it will occur to me as well then.
THU 2:13 PM
Mary said she thought both the John‚Äôs had it too
THU 2:13 PM
They are not sure but have not ruled out genetic connections
THU 2:14 PM
In reading about it
THU 2:14 PM
Yeah me too
THU 2:15 PM
Mary still has pain because her‚Äôs occurred later but I am pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt bother Stephen now
THU 2:15 PM
I'm hoping it will pass quickly for him. It's painful and makes him feel socially outcast even more.
THU 2:15 PM
I have not seen Stephen in a long time.
THU 2:16 PM
Yeah ‚ÄîStephen‚Äôs occured in college
THU 2:16 PM
He could probably text Stephen about it...
THU 2:16 PM
I will let him know.
THU 2:16 PM
Should be talking to him after work tonight.
THU 2:17 PM
Stephen commented on his Facebook post ...
THU 2:17 PM
He‚Äôs generally a man of few words‚Äîalways on the move
THU 2:17 PM
I don‚Äôt notice it on any of their faces anymore so I hope too it passes quickly for him
THU 2:18 PM
Stephen and Natasha
THU 2:19 PM
Image attached to message
THU 2:19 PM
Sorry, work AFK
THU 3:40 PM
I think there is an 85% recovery rate.
THU 3:41 PM
I don't see the signs on his face, but I'm probably not very good at spotting it.
THU 3:44 PM
Yeah I don‚Äôt think it shows
THU 3:45 PM</code></pre></div>
