9 HR AGO
Pretty good ‚Äîhad a good day being a slug yesterday and I needed that :blush: Pups are doing great
9 HR AGO
Lol. Good to be a ~~gangsta~~ slug.
9 HR AGO
Reminds me of Office Space. &quot; I did absolutely nothing and it was everything I thought it could be.&quot;
9 HR AGO
Hehe the OG of the big time nappage!
9 HR AGO
lol!
9 HR AGO
Perfect!
9 HR AGO
I must remember that
9 HR AGO
Went to the drs Friday morning‚Äîregular 3 month check up‚Äî and got him to raise my meds to the level that seems to work
9 HR AGO
He is not a great dr but he gives me what I want and is open at 7 am so I can get to school. Also, he is quick so I rarely wait
9 HR AGO
Very cool.
9 HR AGO
At this point in my life ‚Äîits good
9 HR AGO
I appreciate that he respects your autonomy/self-regulation, understands that you are your own advocate, and takes you at your word rather than an object to be used.
9 HR AGO
I can do the specialist thing and come back and he will write the scripts they suggested
9 HR AGO
Kick that pit's ass.
9 HR AGO
Yeah it‚Äôs nice that he is willing to work with me
9 HR AGO
I am certainly trying! You too...:blush:
9 HR AGO
How‚Äôs your weekend been?
9 HR AGO
Reading and writing a storm.
9 HR AGO
Got a desk for [[1uxb0x]] to sit next to me.
9 HR AGO
That way I can lovingly crack the whip.
9 HR AGO
Nice!
9 HR AGO
Always good way to lovingly prod them along
9 HR AGO
I will try not to be driven insane (but that's already happening, lol). =)
9 HR AGO
Take a deep breath and weigh progress vs frustration ‚Äî will he get there eventually or do I need to push
9 HR AGO
[[AG]] had many days and nights of tears ...[[UJ]] did better than I with her but there were times when it was too much and we would switch off
9 HR AGO
Medicine has been good for her too ‚Äîslows her brain down so she can deal and organize (such a huge difference)
9 HR AGO
She takes focalin
