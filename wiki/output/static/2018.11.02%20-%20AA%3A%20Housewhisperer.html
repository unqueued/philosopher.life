THU 5:43 PM
It‚Äôs was an ok day. How was yours?
THU 5:56 PM
It was good. Busy. [[k0sh3k]]'s head is killing her; sometimes when it's raining, she gets a migraine.
THU 5:57 PM
Oh no! I hope it clears for her quickly. As I have gotten older, I have less headaches
THU 5:58 PM
She has some meds which help reduce the migraine a bit. That has helped.
THU 6:06 PM
Though insurance continues to refuse to pay for the injectable version of the meds or any other treatment options.
THU 6:07 PM
Insurance‚ÄîI have no good words for them
THU 6:28 PM
Have American Heritage Girls tonight with [[AG]]
THU 7:18 PM
Kind of Girl Scout thing
THU 7:19 PM
That's cool. How long has she been into that?
THU 7:34 PM
4-5 years ‚Äîthey all blend together now
THU 7:34 PM
Busy day today but a good day overall‚Äîhow‚Äôs your day?
6 HR AGO
Busy working with the kids today. Pretty good. [[1uxb0x]]'s pirating FLACs, correcting metadata, and building this collection: https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library:%5B%5BMusic%3A%20Library%5D%5D. [[j3d1h]] and I will be scripting a tool for negotiating between the wiki list and the files. [[j3d1h]] helped me move the wiki from our self-hosting VPS to a gitpages (because my dollar a month server isn't going to compete with that), and it loads faster. We've been working on a search plugin for the wiki and thinking about how to correctly make use of tiddlywiki server tools which might allows us to programmatically interact with it on the commandline (trying to have my cake and eat it too here...since I strongly prefer to serve a single html file across the networks I use).

WoW did not crash for me last night. I still cannot reproduce the error.
6 HR AGO

6 HR AGO
Lots of reading for the kids, and we'll be playing music here in a bit.

Reminds me a joke, the punchline sticks with me:
5 HR AGO
A pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel on his pants, a peg leg and a parrot on his shoulder. The bartender says, &quot;Hey, you've got a steering wheel on your pants.&quot;

The pirate says, &quot;Arrrr, I know. It's driving me nuts.&quot;
5 HR AGO
The Administration at school decided that the teachers need a break. So they have been working their way through the classes and subbing after lunch so we can go out to lunch
5 HR AGO
That is awesome.
5 HR AGO
Sounds like your admin actually care.
