<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Imagine a world in which the average-Joe can brainlessly spin up VPS's with zkSNARK cryptocurrencies of anonymized darknets. We would all have our boxes out there, doing our work for us, at high speeds, with yet another proxy buffer. The goal is to make it so that ISP's can't contain users. Let our hard work be done elsewhere if need be. Once we relax liability on them, we are in good shape (except for their desire to form content monopolies, etc.).</p><hr><p>I've seen tons of tools that do things like these. Let's just start compiling and brainstorming.</p><p>Imagine a world in which people worked together:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/FlyersWeb/dhtbay" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/FlyersWeb/dhtbay</a></li></ul><p>I love the Bayesian classifier. Search needs to be decentralized and the most prominent aspect of the network. First and foremost, it must make searching the network incredibly useful.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button></p><p>I donate a certain amount of computing power, RAM, CPU, bandwidth, hard drive space, and in return, I get sick search results. This is how we build good search capacities. As long as we can filter users out (creating banlists), we can easily build networks. Hell, you could even build private communities out of this, but I think that might be a bad thing. Eh. Maybe, make it a trust-based network like Retroshare. </p><p>Call it the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Minternet.html">Minternet</a>, a portmanteau of Mint and Internet.

However, we can make great strides here, and we should. This is what Retroshare should have been. </p><ul><li>A Virtual Dark Network that can live inside and participate within or next to any other network.<ul><li>Preferably, it hooks up all the parts together for the users. It is network agnostic as possible. </li><li>More preferably, it runs on its own network by default.

Ultimately, this must happen at a hardware level. Before that can happen, however, we need a software implementation which operates over the Internet itself in order to generate a userbase large enough from the &quot;Network Effect&quot; necessary to transition to a hardware layer. Such a network would be a threat to the existence of the Internet, and it would eventually be censored. We'd need to make it very difficult to take down from the beginning. Our advantage is being able to take the world by storm. Our alpha software should be beta software, and our beta software should be production ready software, and our production software should be world-class.</p><p>Outropos must be <em>Copyfree </em>opensource.</p><p>One goal is to make the Outopos platform, ecosystem, and hardware neutral/agnostic. </p><p>Users must donate to the network. It's simply infeasible for the network to operate without forcing users to do what is not always in their personal best interest. We must defuse prisoner's dilemmas by eliminating them within the protocol itself as much as possible. How do you prevent cheating? How do you make users play fair? How do you generate trust among strangers? </p><hr><p>Is there content you don't want to see? Ad blockers exist for the clearnet. It stands to reason that we can easily do the same sorts of things for any kind of content. You can curate Oracles, and place your trust.</p><hr><p>Should ask for significant resources on a system. Assume 10GB space minimum. Assume significant CPU, RAM, Connections. You can't play VR games on a bullshit computer, and the nextgen network should be working with absolutely nothing. It needs to use those resources wisely, of course.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Of course, it could eventually be used to search the internet and any network.
