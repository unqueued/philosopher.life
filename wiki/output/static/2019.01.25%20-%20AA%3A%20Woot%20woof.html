FRI 12:47 PM
It is going ok for a Friday ‚Äîhow is Friday treating you?
FRI 12:48 PM
Well enough. Glad it's the weekend.
FRI 12:50 PM
Me too
FRI 12:52 PM
Currently reading and writing (surprise! ;P).
FRI 12:52 PM
Gotta take the big dog back to get her stitches out
FRI 12:52 PM
oh
FRI 12:52 PM
Woot woot
FRI 12:52 PM
woof woof
FRI 12:52 PM
Even better
FRI 12:53 PM
I'm surprised they don't use those stitches which dissolve in pets. I assume they aren't right for the job though.
FRI 12:53 PM
The fight is to get her in the car...
FRI 12:53 PM
They do for where she was spay but not for her hernia
FRI 12:54 PM
Maybe the scooby snacks will lure the puppers into the vehicle.
FRI 12:55 PM
Chicken jerky
FRI 12:56 PM
But she is a female scooby
FRI 12:56 PM
Never had chicken jerky before. That sounds good.
FRI 1:03 PM
They have lots of jerky flavors for pups.
FRI 1:10 PM
What you up to this weekend?
FRI 3:44 PM
Taking the dog in. Hopefully a solid nap, I assume.
FRI 3:44 PM
What shows you been watching lately?
FRI 8:06 PM
I like watching Gordan Ramsey yell at people :blush:
FRI 8:07 PM
As long as it isn‚Äôt me
FRI 8:07 PM
rofl
FRI 8:07 PM
I wonder how many teachers watch him. I bet the % is above average.
FRI 8:08 PM
I saw a clip of his son imitating him. It made me laugh.
FRI 8:08 PM
Hehe probably‚Äîneed a Hell‚Äôs Classroom? Instead of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen
FRI 8:08 PM
His videos with his kids are pretty good
FRI 8:09 PM
I think that would give me PTSD. The kitchen is a classroom in another universe for me. It's just enough distance that I'm not reliving it, but it's close to soothe me.
FRI 8:09 PM
Actually, far above average rates of psychopathy in the culinary field.
FRI 8:10 PM
Like law, politics, finance, etc.
FRI 8:10 PM
Would love to see the man tested.
FRI 8:10 PM
True true
FRI 8:10 PM
As long as he isn‚Äôt hitting people while he is yelling/cussing I am good
FRI 8:11 PM
And he is really gentle with the kids on master chef jr
FRI 8:11 PM
Its so funny to watch him measure his words with the babies
FRI 8:12 PM
That's the important part. He can hold it back, flip the switch, not be himself in those moments.
FRI 8:12 PM
The blood vessels are enough.
FRI 8:12 PM
I can‚Äôt imagine [[AIR]] having to deal with that every day...kitchens are stressful
FRI 8:15 PM
Aye. Kills me.
FRI 8:16 PM
Can't even message. Either I'm blocked or his service is out.
FRI 8:17 PM
(both are possible)
FRI 8:17 PM
I think it is a dark season for him.
FRI 8:17 PM
But, I do not know.
FRI 8:18 PM
:confused:maybe brought on by people arriving from out of town?
FRI 8:18 PM
It‚Äôs too bad there isn‚Äôt a place for him to use his gift that made good money but was lower stress
FRI 8:19 PM
I thought that is possible. I have been thinking about my logs. It is possible given the timing (earlier than I would expect).
FRI 8:19 PM
Maybe? :slightly_frowning_face:
FRI 8:19 PM
In any case, I'm worried, and I'm going to keep trying.
FRI 8:19 PM
He wants to teach or do tutoring. That would be neat.
FRI 8:20 PM
They own him right now, and I'm not sure how to help him break that cycle.
FRI 8:20 PM
Teaching or tutoring would be great
FRI 8:21 PM
Hard to start up, I believe.
FRI 8:21 PM
I thought cannabliss edibles would be something he could do in Colorado (or similar). His deserts are straight up amazing. There would be few who could cook both directions.
FRI 8:21 PM
You have been a protector/ guide for him a long time
FRI 8:22 PM
He certainly could do that
FRI 8:22 PM
But my memories of you and he are old...
FRI 8:23 PM
We are getting old, lol!
FRI 8:24 PM
You might not believe it, but I look older than you by a solid 5-10 years. My big homeless grey beard.
FRI 8:24 PM
This is true very true
FRI 8:24 PM
The past few times, I've asked him to look into asian/french fusion. He is qualified to study under anyone, and that is his specialty (imho).
FRI 8:24 PM
Bah I have glitter strands too
FRI 8:25 PM
It probably looks really awesome in your hair too.
FRI 8:25 PM
Oooo that would be good but first he needs to get out of his pit
FRI 8:25 PM
preach
FRI 8:26 PM
I like them ‚Äîhoping for a solid gray or white someday
FRI 8:26 PM
I personally think guys look better as they age
FRI 8:33 PM
Even with the gray beards
FRI 8:33 PM
Image attached to message
[[UJ]]‚Äôs year book pic haha
FRI 8:33 PM
Lol.
FRI 8:33 PM
His pose is excellent.
FRI 8:34 PM
In terms of sexual mating games among homo sapiens, male sexual attractiveness 
 and prime market value is in the 40's-50's. It is radically lower for females.
FRI 8:35 PM
(this is description, not prescription)
FRI 8:37 PM
Yeah that doesn‚Äôt surprise me
FRI 8:39 PM
Women don‚Äôt age well without work most of the time
FRI 8:39 PM</code></pre></div>
