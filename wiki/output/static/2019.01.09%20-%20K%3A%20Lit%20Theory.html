WED 8:37 AM
Morning. =)
WED 10:15 AM
Your theory class sounds amazing. [[k0sh3k]] and I are both envious. You are living the dream there. =)
WED 10:16 AM
One of the books [[k0sh3k]] is having me read is: How to Read Literature Like a Professor Revised
WED 10:18 AM
I do not have the skills you guys have.
WED 10:18 AM
I‚Äôm super pumped. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have a lot to say in hindsight once it‚Äôs done. 

Perhaps, but I think your view of a lot of things is analytical. /shrug
WED 10:21 AM
When you consume media do you do it purely for entertainment or do you sometimes find yourself looking past the surface level for deeper meaning?
WED 10:21 AM
Indeed. I am a qualified expert in analytical reading and writing. I have a quantitative approach to how I verbalize things. I can promise you that verbal analysis is still somehow different. Whatever it is that I've seen my lit professors and my wife engage in is something which I can understand when they explain it, but I do not have what it takes to reason on my own like they do. Perhaps it will depend on how your class is taught.
WED 10:23 AM
If the point is to make comparisons to bodies of philosophical thought, I can do that very well. If the point is to analyze the symbols and details for a deeper narrative that isn't woodenly literal, beating me in the face, I'm screwed.
WED 10:24 AM
I suggest there are modes of analysis that I simply don't have the brain power to engage in at a high level.
WED 10:25 AM
(no matter how much I practice)
WED 10:25 AM
To your question: https://philosopher.life/#Art:Art
WED 10:25 AM
My opinion is that most forms of media consumption are hedonic drugs.
WED 10:26 AM
I have a carefully curated list of TV shows, movies, books, and music I share with my children so that we have common ground, references, language structures, and experiences (via the narratives in those experience machines).
WED 10:27 AM
I would argue I am constantly looking for the deeper meaning.
WED 10:27 AM
In fact, when I teach literature to kids and highschoolers, that is the only question we attempt to answer: &quot;What is the meaning and purpose of this text?&quot;
WED 10:29 AM
I will agree that lit professors, in the end, are trying to do philosophy. They have a particular style/approach/method which isn't what I'm used to doing. I feel like I can admire it from the outside to some extent. I am not literate in that respect though.
WED 10:31 AM
I think my theory class ultimately wants to aim for both of those sides simultaneously. I‚Äôm always looking for the deeper meaning in what I consume too mostly because I consider my time to me important and if something isn‚Äôt stimulating to me then it isn‚Äôt worth consuming. I‚Äôve watched/played/read enough mindless garbage in my life. Sure there‚Äôs a time and place for it, but especially as a writer my goal is to constantly evolve my craft and discover new ways to two stories or hide bits of information in my work. My goal is for people to never stop thinking or speculating about what I really meant in that aspect.
WED 10:41 AM
To tell stories*** sorry. I‚Äôm walking to class.
WED 10:42 AM
As far as my D&amp;D campaign, I‚Äôve indirectly been pretty successful in that regard. [[L]] came to me after our last session speculating about something I had them experience and discovers a hidden meaning that I never intended to have, but makes more sense than what I originally contrived. I deeply regret not actually planning what she had speculated because I like that something I made had someone wondering what I really meant.
WED 10:44 AM
Discovered***
WED 10:45 AM
I appreciate what you are saying. I suggest there are things which weren't stimulating to me which were worth consuming.
WED 10:45 AM
For sure. Sometimes I just wanna play a game where I can blow shit up. :)
WED 10:45 AM
But I need to be in a special mood to enjoy something like that these days.
WED 10:46 AM
I feel in some ways that grinding for better gear is mindless and uninspired and not stimulating at all, but I still do it.
WED 10:46 AM
I‚Äôm a massive hypocrite. Haha
WED 10:46 AM
Your goal is a difficult one. To have injected a memeplex into the Great Human Conversation that perpetuates itself and continues to evolve in the minds of others (sometimes a form of fame) is no small task.
WED 10:46 AM
I'm currently engaged in the Eisegesis/Exegesis distinction with [[Sphygmus]] on the wiki. I do not know how to answer the question well enough.
WED 10:48 AM
Sometimes I think I‚Äôve ruined experiencing things for myself because I can‚Äôt not look at it analytically. Like the last season of RWBY for me was a complete dumpster fire due to bad storytelling. All of my friends enjoyed the season, but I hated almost every second of it.
WED 10:48 AM
I‚Äôll check it out after class. :)
WED 10:48 AM
I have seen that line of reasoning well. I'm obviously biased here. I think reasoning analytically is exactly what enables me to pick out what is actually salient in the world. That something can be enjoyed doesn't mean it is worth enjoying (or should be enjoyed).
WED 10:50 AM
I will agree that analysis makes it harder to stay on the hedonic treadmill because you will eventually run out of things that are stimulating in a purely pleasurable way.
WED 10:52 AM
(faster than you normally would)
WED 10:52 AM
It‚Äôs just interesting to see all the flaws in the things I used to enjoy. It‚Äôs much more difficult to forgive them now from a writer viewpoint.
WED 10:54 AM
Aye.
WED 10:55 AM
In any case, what‚Äôs on the agenda for y‚Äôall today?
WED 10:55 AM
Working on computers, cleaning, magic, reading+writing, school
WED 10:56 AM
How about you?
WED 10:56 AM
Work today. Native American Religion, American Lit, and Mythology. Got some friends coming over tonight too. Busy start to 2019, haha.
WED 10:57 AM
no doubt, lol
WED 10:58 AM
But our weekly obligations have gone down to 4 nights a week which is giving us a lot more free time.
WED 10:58 AM
At least I hope it will. :sob:
