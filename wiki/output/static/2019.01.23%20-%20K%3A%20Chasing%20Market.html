WED 8:25 AM
Me too and you too.
WED 10:30 AM
How's yoru day going so far?
WED 10:30 AM
Not bad! Back to the old grind. It‚Äôs also pouring down rain so that‚Äôs nice.
WED 10:49 AM
What are you up to?
WED 10:49 AM
I am a fan of the rain. It's a calming sound to me. Sometimes we open the doors and the turn the music down for it.
WED 10:53 AM
Same grind here. Finished another letter to my friend [[T-Money]]. Trying to catch up.
WED 10:54 AM
I wish I could sit outside and just watch it.
WED 10:58 AM
Nice!
WED 10:58 AM
I‚Äôm trying to reach out to even more people with varying degrees of success...
WED 10:58 AM
One of the guys in our friend group has latched in to me about how emotional issues and that‚Äôs a new thing for me.
WED 10:58 AM
His***
WED 10:58 AM
And on*** autocorrect is the worst.
WED 10:58 AM
I'm surprised by that. It always seemed like you were the emotional support for your siblings.
WED 10:59 AM
(and more, obv)
WED 10:59 AM
I'm still trying to figure out how to be more successful in reaching out. I hear that degrees of success issue.
WED 11:00 AM
It has been fascinating to you see reach out to me with enormous consistency. I feel lucky. You are one of the few to take the time.
WED 11:02 AM
I feel like last year wasn‚Äôt the best for maintaining contact so I want to make a conscious effort to fix that.
WED 11:53 AM
The goal is to eventually be in constant dialogue, even if responses are delayed. :)
WED 11:54 AM
I love you.
WED 11:54 AM
We‚Äôre both busy after all
WED 11:54 AM
Yes. Asychronous messaging ftw.
WED 11:54 AM
asynchronous. I'll spell the word correctly some day.
WED 11:54 AM
&lt;3 Likewise. :) I wanna make sure that comes across well.
WED 12:52 PM
I don‚Äôt want you guys to think that we don‚Äôt care about you all
WED 12:56 PM
I see that. =)
WED 12:56 PM
Also I believe [[L]] is making plans to come down during the summer. I‚Äôm not sure when exactly yet but once we iron it out we‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know.
WED 12:57 PM
Aye. We're looking forward to it.
WED 12:58 PM
So I‚Äôm making a game for my D&amp;D group with RPGMaker to commemorate our first year of campaign together. I‚Äôm summarizing the first arc of sessions within it. :)
WED 1:37 PM
Noice!
WED 1:38 PM
I would definitely like to see it.
WED 1:38 PM
I‚Äôve put almost 60 hours into it so far and I‚Äôve finished the whole first session and part of the second.
WED 1:38 PM
Wow!
WED 1:39 PM
It‚Äôs been fun. The program is really intuitive once you get to using it.
WED 1:39 PM
Telling the stories of the stories of ourselves.
WED 1:40 PM
I figured it was the perfect gift from DM to players.
WED 1:42 PM
I was gonna write a short story if you remember, but I realized that nobody there would actually read it...lol
WED 1:43 PM
That does say something about them.
WED 1:43 PM
[[L]] would but only if I pester her to. Haha
WED 1:46 PM
And they‚Äôre all gamers plus this puts them as the stars of the show
WED 1:46 PM
Will you be chasing the market as an author?
WED 1:47 PM
I think I understand what you mean. You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm using my skill in a way that would be more beneficial to the time I put into it right
WED 1:49 PM
?
WED 1:49 PM
I don't know what that means, I'm sorry.
WED 1:50 PM
Because I‚Äôm writing the game story/ script in addition to making maps/ battle mechanics from scratch. :)
WED 1:50 PM
‚ÄúChasing the market‚Äù?
WED 1:51 PM
No, I'm asking what audience you will be pursuing in written authorship. What will be your purpose, meaning, and rhetoric? When push comes to shove, will you be crafting something which is marketable or is that not the most important part?
WED 1:51 PM
Making money making art appears to require building someone people want to pay for (which isn't necessarily merit, though some think that is meritocracy).
WED 1:52 PM
something*
WED 1:53 PM
I‚Äôm making this little game for free for them. It‚Äôs a side project to flex some new creative muscles. 

In response to your question about my writing, I‚Äôm just writing the stories that I wanna read, and whoever that appeals to will hopefully like it. Haha.
WED 1:54 PM
Yes, I understood the first. It just reminded me of the second.
WED 1:54 PM
Cool. Makes sense to me.
WED 1:54 PM
I missed the train to the next thought. Haha
WED 1:55 PM
:man-tipping-hand:
WED 1:55 PM
That is my fault.
WED 1:55 PM
I'm the autist constantly messing up the conversation train, lol.
WED 1:55 PM
You‚Äôre fine. Haha
WED 1:55 PM
I mean I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt say that I was shaking my writing for a wide variety of people.
WED 1:56 PM
But that‚Äôs because I enjoy a wide variety of elements of a story.
WED 1:56 PM
I don‚Äôt read romance, but I‚Äôm interested in writing romantic subplots.
WED 1:56 PM
Things like that.
WED 1:56 PM
I will be interested to understand what you think makes a story particularly good (and hence worth reading to you) beyond its variety of its elements and rhetorical structure.
WED 1:57 PM
What are the stories that matter most to you? FF seems to be one, right?
WED 1:58 PM
I think there are various elements of story within the Final Fantasy games that are great even if they don‚Äôt always come together in the most coherent way.
WED 1:58 PM
But the story is the reason that I play them.
WED 1:59 PM
I mean I like RPGs and leveling and stuff....
WED 1:59 PM
But if there‚Äôs no story, there‚Äôs no value to me.
WED 1:59 PM
That is a powerful claim, no doubt.
WED 1:59 PM
And Kingdom Hearts as well. It‚Äôs a great way to tell a good story badly. :D
WED 1:59 PM
lol!
WED 2:00 PM
I‚Äôll tell you more about that after class. &gt;_&lt;
WED 2:00 PM
k, have fun!
WED 2:00 PM
KH is notorious for being confusing and borderline incoherent.
WED 2:00 PM
It will take a long time to explain its countless nuances.
WED 2:00 PM
As well as why I love it despite them.
WED 2:01 PM
I am always interested in what makes a story objectively valuable. I appreciate your willingness to show me the nuance. Incoherence is not easy to disentangle.
