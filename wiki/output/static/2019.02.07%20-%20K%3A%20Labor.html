THU 8:36 AM
You too. =)
THU 9:25 AM
What you up to today?
THU 9:26 AM
No class today so I‚Äôm working 9-5
THU 9:34 AM
And you?
THU 9:34 AM
[[k0sh3k]] is sick. Tending to her. School with kids. Working on CS with them now.
THU 9:36 AM
Work later tonight.
THU 9:36 AM
Reading and writing otherwise.
THU 9:36 AM
Poor [[k0sh3k]]. :( is she doing any better at least?
THU 9:38 AM
No. It may just be beginning according to her doctor.
THU 10:09 AM
Could be 10-14 days with this flu?
THU 10:10 AM
Also, what's your job like? I never heard about it.
THU 10:10 AM
I‚Äôm a glorified errand boy basically.
THU 10:12 AM
They ask me to move books out, bring books in, recycle books, and whatever else that entails.
THU 10:12 AM
All glory to the Knight-errant on his errands.
THU 10:13 AM
You able to get any classwork squeezed in there?
THU 10:14 AM
I can usually do stuff on my lunch, but I only take an hour. Sometimes an hour and a half.
THU 10:15 AM
Truthfully, nobody really said how long I should take, so I just assume an hour.
THU 10:15 AM
Noice.
THU 10:15 AM
Sometimes I have nothing to do, so I take longer lunches. Haha
THU 10:16 AM
I often think of it as re-uniting or de-alienating myself with my labor, particularly when I'm not paid even a living wage or even close to the value of my labor.
THU 10:18 AM
It's not monkeywrenching, but it's a babystep. It's part of the negotiation. There are some nations in which it is not a crime to attempt to escape prison on moral grounds.
THU 10:19 AM
Yeah I make $9 an hour and work 20 a week. If I worked any more hours I would have 0 work to do.
THU 10:19 AM
Nowhere near a living wage.
THU 10:19 AM
I consider that a form of slavery. It's not like you are shackled and whipped, but there are less visible bonds and forces at play.
THU 10:20 AM
Yeah I see what you mean. Haha
THU 10:21 AM
One way I look at it is to say (at least against adversaries who aim to use me as mere means and have no intention of cooperating with me via [[The Golden Rule]]), I'm free to defend myself against exploitation, including avoiding exploitation. Insofar as I keep my job, I have met the requirements for keeping the job. The social conventions which surround it are an illusion perpetuated by those who benefit from it (or reactionaries who believe they will one day benefit from the system they support).
THU 10:23 AM
Yeah. I only recently got bumped to $9 per hour. In the months before that, I stopped working hard because I didn‚Äôt feel like I was being appreciated enough. Just did the bare minimum to get by.
THU 10:24 AM</code></pre></div>
