<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>What I'd probably do if this was on paper is take out my green pen,
(green = icons, markup, meta,...), or maybe (tolerate errors!) my blue
pen (blue = structure), and put a little letter &quot;a&quot; by irrelevent
stuff for this purpose, and a &quot;b&quot; by where it says &quot;big changes affect
many should be possible.&quot; So the designation on the page would be
&quot;`3b&quot;.</code></pre><p>The ability to make large changes and reuse my content is exactly why I prefer to do this on a computer. I often have done something terribly wrong in my reasoning, but there is usually plenty to salvage. </p><p>Aside: the author of this book doesn't fully read through books. I wonder what he'd say about the same approach to his own book.</p><pre><code>But I STRONGLY recommend just &quot; `# &quot; for a speed thought, since they
are the most common,</code></pre><p>I think this is also a result of having to do it by hand. My hand gets very sore writing even past a couple pages (I'm especially sensitive). I can type 100wpm for hours if I had to (although, obviously, I barely get that much content out). I think the ability to express long-form rides about being able to speak and/or type in the end. I will be interested to see how I will be able to effectively leverage speech-to-text when it's finally solved to 99% (admittedly, I use lots of weird words and syntax that have to be typed). </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If you are only changing a PAGE of a map- that's a situation I've
never run into, but it should be solvable. I'd version off that page
number, using letters. &quot;M3-5c&quot; would be version 3 of the whole map,
version c of page 5. Archive &quot;M3-5b&quot; back with where you archived
&quot;M3-5a&quot;.
</p></blockquote><p>Archiving/versioning are super important. I think that some things are much easier to just do by hand in a journal, and in a way, some of the work of the wiki is about figuring out how to make these kinds of marks ergonomic. I will need to think more about this. There's a lot of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Audit.html">Wiki Audit</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Program%2520Yourself.html">Program Yourself</a> considerations to worry about.</p><p>I can definitely feel the author's need in this book to be able to just tell himself about his own system. It's so incredibly detailed and idiosyncratic that even the creator can forget how it works.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Personally, I think it's healthiest to LOOK FORWARD as you keep your
notebook. Let the dead bury the dead.
</p></blockquote><p>Agreed. Focus on what is in your control as much as possible. I do care about leaving the breadcrumbs of legacy, of course. But, even that is forward-thinking based. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If you ever follow a link to the old version, update the link to point
to the new version, wherever the link's source is.
</p></blockquote><p>I hate to say it, but even the wiki suffers these kinds of problems. There are some mechanics which have to be updated carefully. That said, I really like the ability replace content systematically. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, JUST KEEP YOUR NOTES IN YOUR BOOKS!</p><p>If your book belongs to you, and it has a granger, then by all
means, grangerize it! It's _your_ book! It'll be worth MORE to you if
you put YOUR thoughts in it. 
</p></blockquote><p>If you've had to move as many times as I have, you will reconsider it. I think adding reference numbers to your work is the way to go. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Some times, you'll be looking for ALL of your thoughts on a
particular subject.</p><p>If you do that, you may repeat the search again in the future. Why
go to all that work, AGAIN?
</p></blockquote><p>This problem doesn't go away with a wiki, even though I rapidly perform many searches quickly.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Now, whenever you start a search for a subject, pull out the index
sheet. Write, IN BLUE (because your search word is a &quot;key&quot;), the
search word, NEXT to the letter that the word starts with.
</p></blockquote><p>I think the author would be appalled by my lack of tags. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Your brain is messy. The notebook system
is messy. It's GOOD, it's USEFUL, it WORKS, but part of the reason it
works so well is because it TOLERATES ERRORS. (If you don't tolerate
errors, you are going nowhere with this all.)
</p></blockquote><p>Amen. Say it again! Preach, yo!</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You take your most commonly used pieces of information, and fit them
all onto a single cheat sheet. You use it to work with. It will
probably be highly abbreviated. Good organization is
important. Information density to the max.</p><p>The cheat sheet goes near the VERY END of the subject, so you can
find it quickly.
</p></blockquote><p>I totally appreciate that. I think this is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="antipleonasmic.html">antipleonasmic</a>. I have a lot this is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Computing.html">Computing</a> related projects as well.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>As you invoke abbreviations, or create symbols or shorthand, record
them on the A/S. That way, in a year, you can figure out what in the
world you were talking about.
</p></blockquote><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hlexicon.html">hlexicon</a> is meant to be more universal and long-term. I use abbreviations, of course, but they tend to be googleable. I'm already so difficult to interpret that I don't want to make it its own language anymore than it has to be. Again, I type faster than you'll be able to write by hand with shorthand and cursive. That difference is too important to me.</p><p>I have to delete and insert content too much though. I'm awful at bluebook exams, but that's exactly why I asked to use a computer for those tests. I'm radically better at taking tests when I can type it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If you do this long enough, you'll find yourself making up
words. And the meaning of those words may change (sigh), or spawn off
new words (better).
</p></blockquote><p>Yeah =/...<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="adok.html">adok</a> being an example I keep for myself. This reminds me of naming convention for variables and constructing predicates in FOL. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Chaos is just papers that have hoards of thoughts on them with no
obvious subject placement, or that are so hopelessly beyond recovery
(or take so LONG to recover) that you might likely just throw it out,
but that you'd like to give it &quot;one last chance&quot;. After staring at it
for a while, though, you decide, &quot;Nah. Toss it.&quot; And you do.</p><p>Or you don't. I've occasionally found a jewel in there. Whatever you
like.
</p></blockquote><p>I feel like this is a place where the wiki, setup correctly shines radically. I regularly have to tell my children to stop throwing things away. I beg them to maintain the conditions, workflows, extras, old versions, and drafts of what they make. It's important to keep it. Sometimes you have to recreate or use old things to make completely new ones. Sometimes you just need to tell yourself the story of your progress. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I frequently call it the &quot;subject cache&quot;. It's where the subjects that
you have been using for the last 2-6 weeks go; Ones that you are
accessing frequently.
</p></blockquote><p>Hello, {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Focus.html">Focus</a>}, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Hub.html">Hub</a>, et al. Scheduling/caching is a serious problem in computation.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The Grand Subject Map of Contents (GSMOC) is a map of all of your
subjects. It will probably start out being just a single page, and
will likely baloon out to be several pages large.
</p></blockquote><p>I think <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Hub.html">Hub</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Root.html">Root</a>, but especially {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>} and {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>} serve as my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="reality%2520map.html">reality map</a>s.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>What follows is just gibberish in my lookup process:

S19: Splitting Subjects - when 1 domain knowledge used make conclusion
in 2nd, 2nd is primary. If many-many try go more general. If 1 object
many contexts, the object. ex: ACT2:S9. Particular relevence in a

</p></blockquote><p>See, I'm desperately fighting this Rube-Goldberg machine. It's very hard to keep a clean codebase when you have no idea what you are supposed to be coding. That looks like a secret language to.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>1. When 1 domains knowledge is used to make conclusions in a 2nd
   domain, the 2nd domain is primary.
2. If there is a many-many relationship among domains, try to go with
   the most *general* domain, if at all possible.
3. If there is 1 object in MANY contexts, try to put the object in
   it's own, native domain. If such a thing exists.
4. But: If you have 1 object in ONE context, put the object in the
   CONTEXT.
5. If there is a PARTICULARLY relevant domain, that domain gets it.
   In order to aid in mapping.
6. An action in a particular domain: the domain gets it.

complex to calculate, and that social ideologies are necessarily
unscientific.
