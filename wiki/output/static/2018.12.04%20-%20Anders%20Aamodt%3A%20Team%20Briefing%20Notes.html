</p></blockquote><p>This reminds me of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Original%2520Position.html">The Original Position</a> quite a bit. Activism I can appreciate, but is this a realpolitik cult? I am interested to see what you mean by holographic mythos. We are stepping outside of traditional philosophical language here. I'm not opposed to doing such a thing, but I will <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Straussian.html">Straussian</a>ly try to learn your language. Paranoically, I am worried about a kind of subterfuge in this work. We'll see how it goes though.</p><p>I see a lot of internalism in your work, it reminds me of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Meaningness.html">Meaningness</a> too. Let's see if you really are more than coherentist, idealist, constructivist, non-cognitivist, internalists. It is fascinating to see you think you adopt a nondual perspective, as though you've risen about the dialectic. I consider it equivalent to having claimed to solve the fundamental problem of philosophy itself.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The problem with western civilization is the oedipal complex, and the incomplete status of the project of mass enlightenment
</p></blockquote><p>Claiming to the know the core problem of <em>western</em> civilization may be hubris. I'm going to put you to the test. I am reminded of Orientialism here too. I think the vocabulary of western civilization is rich enough that you should be able to express a semblance of your thesis in fairly standard terminology. It is a redflag that you do not seem to be able to express your point of view in standard philosophical language yet claim to understand that language. I will run with your redflag in charity.</p><p>The <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oedipal complex</a> has a storied historiography as a concept in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Great%2520Human%2520Conversation.html">The Great Human Conversation</a>. I will be interested to see your take on it in this context.</p><p>Enlightenment doesn't seem to end for we <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> creatures pursuing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Infinite.html">The Infinite</a>. I would argue this is not just a problem with western civilization either. I'm not even sure if it's actually a problem, in a sense. It's not up to us.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Very briefly, the Oedipal complex shows up in the way people orally fixate to external sources of authority, suckling on their (president's/sports 
team's/teacher's/guru's/celebrity's/corporation's) ego instead of moving the locus of authority within themselves.
</p></blockquote><p>Yeah. That's internalism, and one of the logical consequences of that perspective is epistemic and normative relativism. It's a form of question begging. Kant may (and the Neo-Kantians do) seem to skeptically take up a similar position. I'd argue you make one of Nietzsche's basic postmodern points and then construct your own authority inside your own mind. </p><p>I agree that faith, the taking up of our {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Axioms.html">Axioms</a>}, is methodologically internalist. The judgment about the objective accuracy of our subjective perspective is not internal to us though. The fact that 2+2=4 is external to me. I am not the ultimate truthbearer, even if I'm the one responsible for methodically coming to understand that external truth.</p><p>Why do you get to justify yourself all the way down? What justifies that? On such grounds, I get to claim my subjective experience is just as valid (or more valid) than yours because I've constructed as such.</p><p>Note, of course, that your authorities are all finite agents (humans in this case). The authority I'm pointing to is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>. It's metaphysics. I make no claim to its agency. There is a difference between <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a>'s authority over you and whether or not you choose to bind yourself to it. I agree with the internalist that it is up to us to freely choose to be constituted by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a> as our core algorithm, but I do not agree with internalist who thinks <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a>'s normativity and content is socially constructed. Social construction is a heuristic methodology for coming to understand the external world better, but that construction is just a sign pointing to the externally signified.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This practice forms many incomplete people into a transpersonal blob, collapsing individual autonomy into a flow of resources to, energetic investment to (emotional/advertising/replicative), and political assent to being ruled by, and moreover becoming literally a part of, the authority.
