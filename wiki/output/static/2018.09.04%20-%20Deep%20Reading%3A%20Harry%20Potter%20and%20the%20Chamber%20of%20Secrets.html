<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I still like mudblood as a concept-word these years later.</p><p>I wonder what the best analog to <em>magic</em> is in our world. Using our &quot;minds&quot; to change things in the world, yes. But, what makes it different? It can't be explained nicely. It seems to me that power is power. </p><p>It always bothered me that Hagrid couldn't use his magic; the political disenfranchisement is real.</p><p>Love that Harry hears a voice. It's somehow very normalized in this world.</p><p>Nearly headless Nick points to the tribalism based on ridiculous rules.</p><p>Filch's lack of power stands differently. I feel like we're meant to have less empathy for him (which isn't to say none).</p><p>The false accusations from shame suck. =/ This is surprisingly emotional for me still.</p><p>Yet, the houses are celebrated. I do not understand when Rowling really agrees to tribalism. I think it extends beyond the moral law for her (which is where she fails).</p><p>I love how the &quot;heir&quot; is prophetic. I think my Christianity added a profound dimension to this series. It helped me lose my faith in the end. I am very appreciative.</p><p>Alright, so am I a pedo for finding Hermione hot? I did as a teenager, so why not now? I really do see my wife in this character in many cases. </p><p>The sportsball was dumb back then, and it's dumber now.</p><p>Dobby is an insufferable character. </p><p>The issue of authority and fear is loud, and perhaps my children need to read this asap. These are valuable narratives to reason about.</p><p>I'm seeing this story through these eyes of the adults more than usual (and I've read this as an adult several times).</p><p>Love to hate Lockhart, as usual. Want to see Snape stomp a new asshole in him.</p><p>I loved the duels before, but I don't care about them now?</p><p>The Parselmouth is still interesting. Gifts of Spirit, a dark mark, etc. Speaking in tongues is a double-edged sword. One must always have an interpreter.</p><p>One thing I did like about the whimsy of the magic in these worlds and the genericness of the abilities in some cases is that I had the opportunity to think about how I might use such powers in my own world. I don't think I did so often though. The world quickly became too incoherent to me.</p></div>
