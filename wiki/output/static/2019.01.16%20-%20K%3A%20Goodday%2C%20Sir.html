WED 8:41 AM
Me too
WED 10:44 AM
I'm been trying to practice meditation.
WED 10:44 AM
I'm pretty sure I'm doing it wrong, lol.
WED 10:44 AM
I don't think you're head is supposed to hurt after you meditate.
WED 10:44 AM
Mine does.
WED 10:44 AM
Maybe you‚Äôre just dehydrated.
WED 10:45 AM
:laughing:
WED 10:45 AM
rofl
WED 10:45 AM
Ummm...Organic?
WED 10:45 AM
Hehe
WED 10:45 AM
Something.
WED 11:08 AM
Keep practicing. :sweat_smile:
WED 11:08 AM
I will.
WED 11:08 AM
Lol
WED 11:08 AM
What‚Äôs your process look like?
WED 11:08 AM
an attempt to focus on not to focusing or thinking about anything (no pink elephants, no recursion, no thoughtloops, no wandering, and I keep losing The Game).
WED 11:09 AM
Just being there
WED 11:10 AM
Lmao
WED 11:10 AM
Why would you tell me that? :sob:
WED 11:10 AM
ur welcome
WED 11:10 AM
Do you roll out a mat? Do you put some calm music on?
WED 11:10 AM
Legs crossed?
WED 11:10 AM
I lay down on whatever surface is available, shut my eyes, and concentrate really hard on not concentrating.
WED 11:11 AM
I think it's working!
WED 11:11 AM
Noice!
WED 11:11 AM
What would you say is the purpose of your meditation?
WED 11:11 AM
Sorry. Got Eastern Mysticism on my mind. :sweat_smile:
WED 11:11 AM
I'm not sure I can give you an answer I'm satisfied with yet.
WED 11:12 AM
Fair enough!
WED 11:12 AM
At the moment, it is exploration.
WED 11:12 AM
I'm trying to shoot for the other side vice in meditation (I've got the expressive introspection down pretty decent...I'm gonna try shutting everything up in this practice instead).
WED 11:13 AM
So eliminating all distractions?
WED 11:14 AM

WED 11:14 AM
My opinion is that the harmonics part has been non-trivial scientific evidence among expert meditators who clearly have powerful control over how they wield their ray of intentionality (or rather the biological apparatus that gives rise to it).
WED 11:16 AM
I'm pretty frenetic, intense, etc. Practicing being calm, harmonious, and quiet is likely a missing piece of the puzzle.
WED 11:17 AM
I agree that I'm trying not to be distracted by anything in my current method of meditation. I want to be able to flick a switch in my head when I need to.
WED 11:17 AM
I consider the predictive coding theory to being the current reigning champion.
WED 11:19 AM
I think it's the most powerful explanation of all the others.
WED 11:19 AM
It also has the most philosophical backing behind it. The rest appear to be metaphors about our computational minds. The Top-down, bottom-up empiricism of Bayesian reasoning does appear to be fundamental to what it even means to be intelligent (let alone conscious).
WED 11:21 AM
Look, I'm seeking to focus my chi into organic balance, maintain vegan hydration, yogate for an hour, and believe I am one with nature.
WED 11:22 AM
That's not too much to ask.
WED 11:22 AM
=)
WED 11:22 AM
I always appreciate that you teach me new words.
WED 11:25 AM
I feel it though.
WED 11:25 AM
I hope you‚Äôll have enough data soon to lean into one of these reasonings. :)
WED 11:25 AM
preach, yo
