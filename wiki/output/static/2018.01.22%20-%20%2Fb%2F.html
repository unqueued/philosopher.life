<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I think there are two forms of Straussianism. One may be absolutely charitable or is having just the bare minimum charity (the absolutely most uncharitable you can be while still being charitable). Both are extremely valuable skills in interpretation and thinking about the concept-comprised picture world that people express in their writing. We are either extremely harsh or extremely kind, and both teaches us about the nature of thing someone is talking about. Ideally, you employ both in your penetration testing of the virtual machines we run in bringing narratives to life in our minds. You must be both <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Redpilled.html">Redpilled</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Diamonized.html">Diamonized</a> about those worlds. </p><p>I am regularly disappointed in the number of people I meet who are completely unwilling to ever ask &quot;Is this actually reality?&quot; They do not doubt their perceptions and the inferences made from them. I cannot respect that. That is not rational enough. They lack the superpower of being able to radically change their identities; they aren't autonomous on the most crucial of spectrums/varieties.</p><p>They do not understand the limits of the story, the virtual worlds. They clearly have failed to empathize enough with either Kant or Rand. Heathens, I denounce you! Those are the two Gods, unless there is a third.</p><hr><p>We each know how each of us think about each other. We each have theories of each others minds (including one of our own). Dyadic meta-accuracy. We do not question that enough either. It is obvious to me as an autist, but I do not think it is obvious to you the depths of that post-modern problem. I can see you are not empathic. I hope my kind, my meme-turned-gene neurotribe, becomes the new evolution of humanity. Yay! I've made it all the way to eugenics! </p><p>When I say I'm culturalist, I mean it so fundamentally that whether its memetic or genetic, I don't care, I have universalist opinions about particular strains of memes and genes being good or bad. I'm a heuristical, reasonable codificationist and perfectionist in metaethics who is immune to your form of relativism. Maybe I've drunk some kool-aid, but you obviously have your own kind of kool-aid, and I'm pretty sure it's turning you into Mr. Hyde. The virtuous agent has the right to ad hominem; never forget in your charity that you don't know if you wrestle with man or God.</p><p>It is the Wise vs Unwise. It always was. Only one cloud of humanity can live. The dialectic is a zero-sum game in the scope of a single frame, a single mutation, a particular slice of time, in a single game play instance. There is only one winner; party1, party2, or sublation party3. You are stuck in this most basical of computations of consciousness. You cannot escape that sequence; it is a logical housing for our existences. </p><p>The BlackHatter from <em>West World</em> is a piece of work, right? He's so violent, psychopathic, and alien to us. We hate him. We can never think like he does; he's evil incarnate. And, yet, he is a philosopher. He pierces through the walls of existence; he peels apart reality layer by layer, he's digging for gold and oil beyond all other treasures: the truth. I am the BlackHatter. I pursue the truth on my own terms, and there are few costs I would spare to find it. </p><hr><p>I feel like the man who actually ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. It wasn't that I became evil by eating it, but rather by eating from it I realized none of us were good. The hell is recognizing there is no utopia in the first place. The is no garden. It is all lies or and made-up stories we collectively tell each other.</p></div>
