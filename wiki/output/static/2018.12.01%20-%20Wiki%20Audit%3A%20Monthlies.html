<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%2524%253A%252Fplugins%252Fsphygmus%252Fcore%252Fstylesheet%252Fflex4h0p3.html">$:/plugins/sphygmus/core/stylesheet/flex4h0p3</a> has been modified to keep the sidebar black and opaque for mobile. The goal is to make sure the rainbow doesn't overlap. I believe my brother was reading through my wiki in the doctor's office last night. It is a functional problem if you can't read the sidebar. It's basically mini-commandline on this wiki. I'd like to add, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>'s work is so beautiful. In fact, I watched the chess championship in a second window IN the Wiki Workspace, and that would not have been possible without her. </p><p>Speaking of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Sphygmus.html">Sphygmus</a>, I have been giving more thought to her <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Auto-Wiki-Mator-Button.html">Auto-Wiki-Mator-Button</a>. I have a billion things I'm trying to do (or it feels like it), but it is very clear to me that I want to integrate and develop what she has done very deeply; it should be a process on this wiki. In the end, I want specific buttons carefully designed for all the projects that matter to me. I want to be able to control my interface as well as she can control hers. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Audit%253A%2520The%2520Button%2520Project.html">Wiki Audit: The Button Project</a> is now in dreams. She has sent me on a path in the desert, and I hope to complete that vision. It's gorgeous and functional (I could offer no higher praise to something which partakes and instantiates both <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Beautiful.html">The Beautiful</a>...that might just be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>!).</p><hr><p><strike>I've decided that the work I'm doing in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Remodeling.html">The Remodeling</a> needs to be done in the monthly <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="audit.html">audit</a>. I want to be able to catch up, and I want that behavior to be normal for me. Logs rarely require a great deal of work outside of grammar, cleaning up the formatting, perhaps some footnotes for semantic edits, and making sure it's tagged (already done in this case).</strike></p><p><strike>I had been considering doing this work in my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Review.html">Wiki Review</a>, but &quot;a day later&quot; just isn't appropriate for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="audit.html">audit</a> work. Admittedly, even a month might not be enough to disassociate. That said, I still intend to continue to the complete overhauls/re-reads.</strike></p><p>No. This is not going to work. It just needs to be pure <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Audit.html">Wiki Audit</a>. I need to disconnect completely before I clean up the mess. It may take longer, but that is okay. I can always write down my stopping point in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Remodeling.html">The Remodeling</a> and start there for mini remodeling or something.</p><hr><p>The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Monthly%2520Auditable.html">Monthly Auditable</a>'s have been audited! That went by much faster than usual, but that may be because it was a Saturday. I basically had the whole day. Coffee helped too. =)</p><hr><p>WTF happened to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Highdeas%2520Log.html">Highdeas Log</a>? Why did that get deleted? It's not like I fully agree with it, but I still largely do. Was it an element of paranoia? Was it dislike? I make no note of it either. Wtf? Reinserted, timestamps are taken off in this case (first time ever?). I need a solid method for greping through my archives. It turned out to be a waste of time, I think, but that's okay. I should celebrate mistakes in this case. Not all of my projects and approaches work out, and I need to consistently remind myself of that fact.</p><hr><p>I actually made some headway today in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Remodeling.html">The Remodeling</a> despite the mountain of other work I've done. Noice.</p></div>
