<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>To an old pirate's eyes, book publishers are among the most cutthroat IP wielders in media. They apply enormous pressure very quickly in some domains proportional to their resources. I literally wept with the loss of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://library.nu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://library.nu/</a>. It may have been the single greatest open library that humankind will have ever had access to. </p><p>Neoliberal censorship is a big fucking deal. I think Blouin could have gone much further here.</p><p>I had not considered this attack on King's <em>On Writing</em> before. I'm not sure I buy it. But, I do buy the turn inward, and yet I am profoundly concerned with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. I'm not just interested in just any ol' community though. I can agree that insofar as one writes to make money, the market will dictate what you write, and that's generally a bad thing. Again, those who fight without the golden-rule gloves have the competitive advantage; evil will rise to the top in perfect competition. You get, at best <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T4T.html">T4T</a> strategies, but asymmetry and winner-take-all usually will demonstrate even worse strategies to be competitively superior. I am grateful to Blouin for saying something about this; I needed to hear it.</p><h2 class="">Danielle Steel and New Home Economics</h2><p>Alright, embarrassing disclosure time: I've never read Steel before, and I barely even know who she is other than the fact that she's famous. I'm not with it, lol. I know I'm illiterate, especially about mass media. That makes me a very poor judge of Blouin's words.</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Steel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Steel</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Danielle_Steel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Danielle_Steel</a></li></ul><p>I've not a read a single one of these books, or at least I can't recall any of them. I am blown away by how many she writes though. Is she employing ghostwriters? That's an insane number of books. 2-3 in a year is already insane. 6 seems impossible. She is certainly wealthy enough and surrounded by a publishing industry that would enable her to do so. Clearly, she is insanely talented at what she does, no matter how you cut it.</p><p>I adore pornography, but I know it's a drug! These experience machines are drugs. Countless dystopian commentors have been right about this.</p><p>I'm in no position to even understand Steel's love-liquidity relationship. Perhaps I need to read one of her books to get the point? </p><p>I suggest Blouin is wrestling with and attacking individualism and self-development as dark-triadic morally relativistic egoism reinforced by neoliberal market forces, policies, and propaganda. </p><p>The Entrepeneurial Self is such a fascinating concept. I am worried that Blouin and I are going to need to tease out and wrestle with this quite a bit. The concepts of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, how we spend our lives and autonomy, really does have this icky economic quantifiable problem we must directly handle. I'm a Kantian, so I know that ick-factor. Blouin paints so hard and fast, and he doesn't give me enough definitions, though he points (but again, I'm an analytic philosopher, which makes me a huge pain in the ass...plus, I'm being a huge fucking hypocrite on this point).</p><p>Time-poverty, lack of realism. Yup! In the end, these are lies. She is giving us rhetoric in the &quot;have your cake and eat it too,&quot; it's your fault, not a systematic problem.</p><p>I am concerned that Blouin lacks the philosophical background to reason about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> in utilitarian terms. Believe me, I'm out to crucify most utilitarians for their rhetoric and selfishness, but computational ethics is computational ethics. If you buy codificationism (yes, you CAN handle non-cognitivist worries), then you are going to need to be able to speak the various languages in ethics. Look, I totally understand The Slip here, however, insofar as you can, you must preach in the language of the wicked. Does Blouin really understand the ethical considerations he talks about here? I fear he is sweeping.</p><p>I think it's time to start ad hominem on Steel at this point. What do you predict (which is not moral expectation) from a romance author? It appears this is an economic game to her. She's a bad person, and you should predict books commensurate with her reality map. </p><h2 class="">Michael Crichton and the Heritage of Invention</h2><p>Finally, here's an author I'm mildly familiar with. Uh, I feel my bias is just being confirmed here. I worry, however, that there are some uncharitable moves in this argument. Some of the interpretation seems to be reaching!</p><p>One concern I have boils down to a difference in our understanding of the common <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Redpill.html">Redpill</a> of memetics and genetics. I actually grant Neoliberals large swathes of their description of homo sapiens (as profoundly irrational, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> homo economicus even), and I'm not convinced Blouin does. Of course, I don't think a description is the same as prescription, and I happen to believe we are radically free. Hence, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ridtyawtr.html">ridtyawtr</a>. I'm not sure if Blouin wants to go there.</p><p>Tons of work on uncertainty here. I'm not seeing a good argument about it though. Am I blind? It appear agnotology is a rhetoric device for manipulation. </p><p>One thing I want to say about &quot;uncertainty&quot; is that it has some prosperity gospel lottery in it, where &quot;maybe you could be the winner.&quot; I also agree that pushing people into doubt to the point that they celebrate hyperreality and not setting down their tentpegs in commitment (especially for being philosophically well-integrated) is a serious crime against humanity.</p><h2 class="">Tom Clancy and the Liberal Family Tree</h2><p>I have almost no experience with Clancy, but I do know <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Hunt%2520for%2520Red%2520October.html">The Hunt for Red October</a>. Of course, it was a learning opportunity for my children. Not in love with many aspects, and I don't get a long with the folks that like him. I grew up 15 minutes from Fort Knox too, so you'd think I would have more exposure. Meh.</p><p>I primary difference I've seen between Neocons and Neolibs is how much lipservice is paid to giving a shit about Humanity. Neocons are proud of their insanity, open about the fist within the glove in a way that Neolibs attempt to hide. They keep the Randian-Locke memeplex, but add that dash of xenophobia, social regulation, and hatred for The Other (the outgroup) which Neolibs claim to be against (who cares what we pay the workers, as long as at least half of them are women, right?). For a Neocon, Sunday school, if they attend at all, is a professional networking tool and virtue signal.</p><p>More on the abuse of uncertainty here. Fascinating. Yes, it does make it &quot;thrilling.&quot;</p></div>
