SAT 11:59 AM
What you up to this weekend?
SAT 11:59 AM
I am being a blob on the couch until work tonight
SAT 12:00 PM
/high-5
SAT 12:00 PM
How about you?
SAT 12:00 PM
:raised_hands:
SAT 12:00 PM
=)
SAT 12:00 PM
Doing my usual: reading, writing, talking.
SAT 12:01 PM
Nice!
SAT 12:01 PM
Think I have the opportunity to go on a date again today. I'm stoked.
SAT 12:01 PM
Woot woot!
SAT 12:01 PM
How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]]?
SAT 12:02 PM
[[UJ]] is doing Emmaus today ‚Äî[[AG]] is blobbing with me
SAT 12:02 PM
Neat.
SAT 12:03 PM
The heart dr sent me for a sleep apnea test ‚Äîthey can do them at home now too. After looking into it, I am interested to see if I actually have it and how that connects to the pit. What do you know about sleep apnea
SAT 12:04 PM
I know almost nothing about it.
SAT 12:05 PM
Hmmm well I has some research to do...
SAT 12:05 PM
I can see it in our family. You are a non-trivial candidate. Sleep really is that important, and it has radical impact on the pit.
SAT 12:06 PM
Not to be tired would be amazing
SAT 12:06 PM
They are thinking that it triggers the rapid heart beat since most of time when I have SVT that it is at night when I am sleeping
SAT 12:08 PM
Interesting. That may be. I think it is excellent that you are hunting the wolves down.
SAT 12:09 PM
I pick up the testing stuff on the 26th
SAT 12:09 PM
I assume the machine keeps the stats, but will you also be keeping a journal?
SAT 12:10 PM
They had me do that already for a week
SAT 12:10 PM
But yeah it keeps stats I can‚Äôt
SAT 12:11 PM
I regret that I don't know [[AG]]. I get to have a relationship with [[L]], but I should with [[AG]] too. I know my kids are younger too, but I think it would be cool if they talked. Does she have Signal, Discord, or what are her preferences?
SAT 12:18 PM
Most of the time she doesn‚Äôt know where her phone is :confused:
SAT 12:19 PM
Lol! That sounds like my son.
SAT 12:19 PM
But I can download signal for her
SAT 12:19 PM
[[j3d1h]] and I are...in conflict over her phone. It is a non-trivial struggle to make sure she doesn't take it to bed with her. Girl will lie to my face about it too. 1AM, still talking instead of sleeping (I realize...I have little room to talk here).
SAT 12:21 PM
She loves when she has a chance to play with your kids‚Äîespecially [[1uxb0x]]
SAT 12:21 PM
Yeah if [[AG]] can find her phone then she is up playing game on it
SAT 12:21 PM
Aye. And, I want to us to be family, not just blood relatives. I want to start weaving the invisible threads into our fabric.
SAT 12:22 PM
That would be great
SAT 12:22 PM
We can probably make a trip in July for a few days :blush:
SAT 12:22 PM
That would be sick.
SAT 12:23 PM
You still up for camping? Or you want something else?
SAT 12:23 PM
(I'm down for whatever)
SAT 12:23 PM
Anything is fine
SAT 12:23 PM
We shall look for ideas between now and then
SAT 12:24 PM</code></pre></div>
