<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I'm writing this a day later, so my memory might not be as clear about it.</p><p>My car was packed, and I went straight to work. I arrived the earliest again. I started setting up. When Jaye got there we started trying to mount the spool temporarily to see if it was plumb. It wasn't perfect. Part of the problem is that the pipes we are connecting to aren't actually vertically aligned with each other as we thought. Our spool was far from perfect as well. It was good enough though. So, I had Jaye finish the final flange off.</p><p>During the break, I ran to get my check. $321 for 20 hours of work, ~$16/hour post-tax. That's $800 a week. Terry noted that he didn't see why I was there, how I could afford it, how my wife would let me, etc. I'm a drifter, a pariah, a gypsy to this man. </p><p>It seemed like we were just about to mount the second spool, and I needed to begin working on the screwed up spools the previous crew made. I asked for a lift. This was my first time driving one. I got my harness on (since I was going higher than 6-feet, thank you OSHA<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button>), also my first time using one. Driving is awkward, but it works. I think in time I will get better at it. I could easily see hitting something with it by pushing too hard on the throttle. I got it there, but the lift didn't work. I tried charging it, and it didn't work. I talked to Terry, and he said he'd do something about it, but to charge in the meantime. I did, but it wouldn't go more than a couple inches. So, I went to talk to Terry again, since my progress as halted. Terry was bashing his portaband on a pipe not working for him, and he was screaming at the pipe. He calmed down, and then Terry came and walked up to a Hispanic foreman with a crew doing drywall and said he was taking their lift. The Hispanic foreman was not pleased, but he immediately agreed. Terry must be fairly powerful on the jobsite to do that, I assume. This lift worked.  I unmounted the pieces the &quot;clowns&quot; put up while Jaye finished his welding. I returned the lift and apologized + thanked the man who let me have it. </p><p>Someone doing ductwork talked to me, an old black man I couldn't understand who wanted to fuck with me. As long as I play along, hand them submission signals<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> at the appropriate times, and attempt to blend as well as I can (which is quite poorly at that), I may eventually not have to worry. Friendliness goes a long way, often enough. It doesn't seem sufficient with Terry, but that's okay. I'll do what I can anyway.</p><p>I started cutting the pipe for the cold water (clown) spools. I wanted to reuse as much as I could. I had to ask Terry about where he wanted the brass thermometer outlet. He wants it high, so that means I can't reuse everything nicely.  </p><p>Terry had to leave to do some passport work. I took lunch. I actually got chicken for lunch. I thought I earned it, and I had nothing else to eat but a bit of fruit. I was hungry, surprisingly. My teacher, Tim, called me again during lunch. That man has really got to bat for me, been in my corner, pick your sportsball metaphor. I owe him a lot.</p><p>We went to mount the spool that was finished after lunch. The spool fitup nicely enough, and with some pushing, it was plumb enough (or so it seemed). I mounted the top valves section and then put the lift away. When I came back, I saw that while it was plumb in the direction I was worried about, it was now very, very off in the other plumb cardinal direction. I was sick to my stomach mortified. This is what the other crew got fired for. I was so frustrated, I felt like crying. I got my protractor out, and I saw two problems.</p><p>One was that after the flange was welded, it actually lost its plumbness some, and furthermore, the reducer was off. Jaye thinks he may have warped it by welding it too hot, but I think the fitup was bad (my fault). I cut the leg attached to the top flange to see if we could push it into place and tack it. Unfortunately, I may have cut too much off. Again, super frustrating. We dismounted the whole thing. I cut the reducer too. None of them are clean, and I had to cut on the welds. It was fucking awful. We did a ton of grinding trying to make them even remotely decent. That was where we ended up. Our second spool is laying in pieces, and I'm kind of dying inside about it.</p><p>I'm pretty sure I'm going to be fired over this. Jaye doesn't think so, but I do. I told him that if we do get fired that he needs to throw me under the bus because it is my fault. I think I may be given one more week on the job at most. I'm still on probation, and it makes sense that they would let me go. I'm not who they need, I fear. Hopefully, that will be enough time to get my tools, to earn a bit more cash, and to give us just enough time to find another job! This job really needed more tools than I had and I needed more experience to do it. I am consistently reminding myself that I am essentially being paid to go to school here. They don't think of it that way at all, and it would mortify them to see it that way. But, it is true from my perspective. Even if I do get fired, I'm really glad to have had the chance to get baptized by fire, to see it all come together like this, etc. I feel like I'm failing, but not in too bad of a way. I'm learning, and that's all there is to it. I'm required to journeyman level work here with only 6 months of experience. Mistakes are expected; we're only human. Frankly, I should be proud of what I've been able to do given what I have. </p><p>Some general contractor, Greg, came by and was screwing with Jaye and me, mixing our names up on purpose while smiling. He wanted to know how long we were going to be there doing the work. Apparently, it was supposed to take 5 days, and we clearly won't be finished it in time. He does the scheduling for the whole site. He wanted to know who was in charge, and I said I guess it would be me. He said if I were in charge, I would know it, and I would not hesitate. He was worried about the primer paint crews rushing towards us in the warehouse. He had to do some research but said we couldn't work on our project on Monday because it would be hazardous to our health, and it could easily start a giant fire since we were welding. </p><p>Barry was called. We will, instead, be working on the second floor. Barry says this one is extremely tough. I'm already failing on the easy one, lol. I'm pretty fucked, I think. I'm not going to give up though! I need to squeeze this job for every drop of experience and knowledge that I can get. I am thirsty, and I need this baptism by fire to continue wandering the desert.</p><p>At the end of the day, another SMS crew maybe doing HVAC, I don't know, had a foreman, AJ, who said he'd heard about me and offered me water from his cooler since Terry was gone.</p><p>I forgot to lock the gangbox, and I don't know if Jaye did it. Terry will be pissed if he finds out.</p><p>I'm getting a wrap around and 2-foot level, but I'm also getting a real torpedo level from Lowe's today as well. Hopefully, that will help and give me a way to show I'm working on improving what I'm capable of doing.</p><p>Remember: check the gangbox to make sure it is locked early on Monday, and make sure the equipment is moved out of the way so it won't be painted white.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Note that Terry doesn't wear one, even when he is just balancing on pipes 20 feet in the air. Insanity.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> I believe I am highly ticklish with my wife but not others specifically because I am vulnerable to her in this way. Being ticklish is a form of submission. I readily submit to my wife at an instinctual level.</sub></p></div>
