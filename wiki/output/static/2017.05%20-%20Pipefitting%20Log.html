It really started me down this log-keeping path. </li><li>I feel like my Pipefitting Log this month has shown me that I've soaked up the majority of what I'm going to get out of this program. In addition to my financial needs, it seems obvious to me that I should pursue employment. I think I'll miss out on some cool things, 2 NCCER books of content (I should still perhaps pickup some copies), and especially welding. It's worth sacrificing these opportunities, I believe.</li><li>I covered socket welds, buttwelds, and completed the coursework. Good job!</li><li>It took a month to get together with Dale, the welding instructor. I'm glad I did though. The wait was worth it. I have had a lot of people tell me to forget pipefitting and go into welding, although I've had many pipefitters tell me I'll be a great pipefitter too. What do I want? I want stability, now. I believe I can learn to weld at the union, and worse comes to worse, I can weld at my own house and take my work to Dale when I have the chance. He will help me on the side, I believe.</li><li>Creating the second simulator for the classroom was a real project. I'm proud of my work. It wasn't perfect, but I did a good job.</li><li>I spoke at length about the people I worked with this month. I think that's good. I need to continually generate perspective on the people around me and my social interactions. Simply put, socializing is not my strength as an autistic person. This is a valuable tool for helping me overcome my disability in this realm.</li><li>Overall, my posts tended to be shorter this month (or so it feels).</li><li>I'm going to miss not working with Chris, when the day comes. I need to get his number and stay in touch with him. I legitimately like him.</li><li>I said that my days weren't as productive as I'd have liked. I think that is another sign to myself that something is off or wrong. I'm not moving at the pace I want. I'm not making the progress I need. I know I can do more. I think employment really is the next step here.</li><li>I'm on my first piece of serious morally permissible (if not obligated) deception: I must find an employer for the short-term, but I can't say that (else they won't hire me). I need to make money, and I need to get enough done that I could walk into the union as a 2nd or 3rd year (which would be amazing). <ul><li>Also, after I am hired at the union, I want to negotiate the possibility of an accelerated course. I believe I could learn to be a journeyman pipefitter in a year, and perhaps a journeyman welder in a year or two. I am a unique outlier, and exceptions should be made for me. I'm worth that investment. I want to push into valves as soon as possible. <ul><li>It would be amazing to build up relationships around the nation as someone who does valve work. Maybe they could ship me valves, I'll work on them, and ship them back? I could work in my own shop! That would be sick! Dreams, perhaps infeasible and implausible at that.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>We had a huge break in the middle of the month. I'm really glad that I came to school anyways to learn from another instructor. It was a valuable use of my time and a wise move.</li><li>I've not really had any productive writing on my off days. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong here.</li><li>It really was a productive month. I think I was being too hard on myself.</li></ul></div>
