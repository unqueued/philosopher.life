<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>1.</p><p>In perception, there is an agent, a medium, and a patient. The agent is the perceptible object. It has certain accidental qualities which inhere in it. The perceptible qualities of the agent are what are perceived. In the process of perception, the agent undergoes a change in becoming perceived, and it transmits perceptible qualities via the medium to the patient. The medium is a transparent layer between the agent and patient; Aristotle considers the medium necessary because he is a plenum theorist, and he wishes to deny ‚Äòthe void‚Äô. The agent, essentially, acts upon the patient. The patient is that which perceives. Unlike plants, animals and humans (which are animals with intellection) have the capacity of perception (also motion). Animals and humans are the patients upon which agents (perceptible objects) act. (Admittedly, that is an awkward way of thinking about perception for moderns, but it makes more sense in Aristotle‚Äôs ontology).</p><p>Perception requires a sense organ. The sense inheres in the sense organ, and the sense cannot be reduced to the physical matter of the sense organ. The function and purpose of the sense organ, perhaps even the form of that organ, is its corresponding sense.</p><p>Let‚Äôs go through a quick example: the whiteness of the whiteboard, the agent, is transmitted through the medium, the medium in some way carries this whiteness over to the agent, and the sense-organ, in this case the eye, which has the sense of sight, perceives this whiteness.
Perceiving at the level of sense organs becomes a bit more complicated though. The sense must take on the form, but not the matter of what it senses. In this case, the sense becomes ‚Äòwhitened‚Äô in some manner. Exactly how, we aren‚Äôt sure. Perhaps there is a physical change in the eye such that the eye literally becomes whitened. But, it is also possible that there is a metaphorical interpretation. In either case, the sense must become whitened in some manner. The sense must take on the form of whiteness, becoming ‚Äòlike‚Äô the whiteness which also inheres in the agent, the whiteboard. </p><p>There are also common sensibles, which basically can be perceived via multiple senses. The desk is an example of a common sensible object; it looks like wood and it smells like wood. Aristotle, in responding to Plato, wanted to avoid having ‚Äòmultiple selves‚Äô, which he thought might result from having separate senses. It seems that the individual senses passed the perceptual information along to the common sense. It is the common sense which unites all the individual senses. The common sense realizes that the common sensible object, which we perceive with multiple senses, is really just one object. Without this common sense, Aristotle believes the world would be largely unintelligible. We would be constantly bumping into things. </p><p>Perception precedes and feeds intellection. Intellection is similar to perception in many respects. The intellect, like perception, takes on its corresponding objects, such as definitions. Consider that after you have seen many particular horses (without knowing what a ‚Äòhorse‚Äô was), your intellect enables to come to an understanding of the form and definition of horseness which is universal about all horses. That form of horse, the definition and universal, in some way resides in your intellection, you are literally thinking about the universal. This brings up to the major difference between perception and intellection.</p><p>Perception is about the particulars and sensing the sensible, accidental qualities of those particulars. Intellection, however, is about the universal. You don‚Äôt think about individual things, you think about the definitions of things. Particulars in some way aren‚Äôt intelligible, especially insofar as they are accidental. The capacity for perception deals with what is accidental, while the capacity for intellection doesn‚Äôt, instead intellection thinks about what is universal and definitonal.</p><p>We should note that what while perception seems necessary, in some way, for intellection, Aristotle holds the capacity for intellection to have a higher status (as an activity) than perception. This is demonstrated in his distinction between animals and humans. Intellection is the rarer capacity.</p><p>2.</p><p>In the metaphysics, we see a change in Aristotle‚Äôs account of substance as set out in the Categories. In the categories, primary substances were individual things in the world. So, for example, Socrates was a primary substance. Secondary substances are the universal definitions. Socrates belongs to the secondary substance of ‚Äòman‚Äô. The definition of ‚Äòman‚Äô is a rational biped, and that is what counts as the secondary substance. Note that, in the categories, the existence of secondary substances relied upon the existence of primary substances. If there were no primary substances, then there would be corresponding secondary substance either. In this case, if there were no humans in the history of the eternal universe, the definition of man would not exist. It seems that primary substances, at some sense, precede secondary substances in the categories.</p><p>The Metaphysics alters this view of substance. The metaphysics isn‚Äôt just any science, it is the study of being qua being. The metaphysics de-emphasizes ‚Äòwhat is most knowable to us‚Äô, instead emphasizing ‚Äòwhat is most knowable in itself‚Äô. In this, metaphysics is the highest science. It seems that what is most intelligible in the universe may not be those things with potentiality or even particular things. Instead, the most intelligible things are more universal. The status of ‚Äòdefinitions‚Äô seems to gain some ontological priority in the metaphysics.</p><p>Primary substance is now what we had previously thought of as secondary substance in the categories. So, the definitions of things are now the primary substance. The definition of man, for example, would be a primary substance. This is strictly the form and definition; it is not an actual instantiation. Secondary substances in the metaphysics are like the primary substances in the categories. Essentially, secondary substances are now individual instantiations of the definition. </p><p>3.</p><p>In remembering Aristotle‚Äôs framework of potentiality and actuality, we know that actuality must, in some sense, precede potentiality. God is actuality that precedes all potentiality. God is fully actual. He has no potentiality. God is eternal and unchanging. God is the highest being in Aristotle‚Äôs teleology and ontology. Aristotle‚Äôs God is very much the exception in Aristotle worldview. For example, he has the capacity for intellection, but has no body (unlike all other things which have intellection, namely humans). God has no matter, which makes sense given matter‚Äôs association with potentiality. This may be contrasted with God‚Äôs complete actuality.</p><p>Additionally, God isn‚Äôt the being we normally conceive of in the Judeo-Christian tradition. He is a creator in some sense, but not the creator ex nihilo. God doesn‚Äôt even intervene in the world with miracles or care about the rest of creation as we might traditionally think in Judeo-Christian tradition.</p><p>God sets the heavens into circular motion, and in some sense, He moves all other things without Himself being moved. He is the unmoved mover. He doesn‚Äôt move the heavens as billiard balls moves billiard balls. Rather, the moves the heavens by inspiring ‚Äòdesire‚Äô in them. The heavens want God; the heavens, in some sense, want to be like God. This desire forces them to move, but God does not move. Thus, we say he is the unmoved mover. 
Interestingly, the heavens are eternal and changing. Circular motion is the closest to the stability of being unmoved, and so the heavens have a high status in the mind of Aristotle. There seems to be a trickle-down effect of motion, from the heavens to the rest of the world. The heavens impart motion to the planets and other parts of the universe, and essentially we can see moved movers moving other things, all the way down the potential existence of things which pass into being and out of being on Earth. In the end, we see that all things owe their movement to God.</p><p>We must then ask: what is the activity of God? He thinks. God thinks about the best things. God thinks about His thinking. Aristotle‚Äôs God is self-thinking thought. In some ways, we as humans partake in the activity of God, temporarily, when we think. Obviously, Aristotle holds the activity of thinking in high regard (seems reasonable).</p></div>
