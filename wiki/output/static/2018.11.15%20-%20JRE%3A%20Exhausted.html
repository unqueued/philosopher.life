WED 2:47 PM
Also, I'd like to recommend a silly show to you to try out (short episodes): Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell
WED 3:09 PM
Second season was truly &quot;meh&quot;, but then they started pushing it to the limit again in the third.
WED 3:09 PM
It's the Adult Swim version of The Good Place.
WED 3:10 PM
How's it going?
WED 6:55 PM
How you doing?
5 HR AGO
Exhausted
5 HR AGO
I'm sorry. =(
5 HR AGO
How's the meat processing facility?
5 HR AGO
Emotionally exhausting and physically?
5 HR AGO
Im in the cleanest area there
5 HR AGO
How clean is that? lol
5 HR AGO
But its big wire, so tiring
5 HR AGO
Ah.
5 HR AGO
Pretty damn gross from the job trailer to our jobsitr
5 HR AGO
Site
5 HR AGO
Like, lots of clumps of pig hair on the ground, tubs of ground up pig guts/blood
5 HR AGO
A lot of hot liquid lard
5 HR AGO
=(
5 HR AGO
How many people on the old job site got transfered?
5 HR AGO
And if a pig wont walk off the truck (taken as sign of sickness) they are required to kill it there and just roll them onto the ground in the open, where they sit for days rottong, until someone takes them to get ground up for dog food
5 HR AGO
Jesus
5 HR AGO
2 of us got transferred
5 HR AGO
But at our jobsite its not bad at all
5 HR AGO
Goin in the mornin isnt too bad
5 HR AGO
But after lunch the smell hits me way more
5 HR AGO
No gagging, but close
5 HR AGO
I'm sorry. That sucks.
5 HR AGO
They said it was probably one day of pulling wire, i get there and realize they had no clue what these guys had planned
5 HR AGO
Is there a way to mask the odor?
5 HR AGO
Waaaaaay big wire pull, will take another week no doubt
5 HR AGO
Nah, but its sleeting on the roof we are working on, the cold and distance makes it almost unnoticable most of the time
5 HR AGO
You keeping a particular set of work clothes on site?
5 HR AGO
Nah, just washing one set each night
5 HR AGO
Cool.
5 HR AGO
Im not going in the building, so its only like 10% of what it could be
5 HR AGO
Good!
5 HR AGO
Oh, I forgot to ask: how was the visit on Sunday?
5 HR AGO
Awesome
5 HR AGO
I got there late
5 HR AGO
Sat next to ann and had really nice conversation
5 HR AGO
That is awesome.
5 HR AGO
Everyone looking healthy?
5 HR AGO
How's Consuela doing?
5 HR AGO
No awkwardness... but also didnt say anything besides hi to gramps since he was all the way at the other end of the table
5 HR AGO
Didnt talk to her either unfortunately
5 HR AGO
[[K]] lost lots of weight
5 HR AGO
Ah. Well, sounds like seating positions were strategic and useful to everyone.
5 HR AGO
I am envious.
5 HR AGO
I will ask him about his secrets
5 HR AGO
Yeah
5 HR AGO
Jelly
5 HR AGO
I made an ass of myself comparing the steak there to another restaurant
5 HR AGO
lol
5 HR AGO
Got huge steak, said it was quantity over quality
5 HR AGO
Check came, ann paid for everyone
5 HR AGO
I felt like a fool
5 HR AGO
I am awful at reasoning on the fly about that kind of stuff.
5 HR AGO
Yeah, i just apologized and thanked her, she was gracious
5 HR AGO
She is gracious, no doubt.
5 HR AGO
not for that situation, but from the collection of things I have seen from her
5 HR AGO
See...I can't even reason correctly in chat, lol.
5 HR AGO
It's like we are forced into the &quot;you know what I mean&quot; or something.
5 HR AGO
Anyway, I'm envious that you got to see everyone.
5 HR AGO
Her response to you really hit me, was really glad to see and talk to jer
5 HR AGO
Her
5 HR AGO
I have not talked to [[UJ]]. Not sure if he would be interested. Though, I am interested in what's happening in his life.
5 HR AGO
I try to ask about him and [[AG]].
5 HR AGO
I hate that I don't know [[AG]] at all.
5 HR AGO
I mean, I know her, but not really.
5 HR AGO
[[AG]] got her braces off and her voice changed
5 HR AGO
It was so crazy seeing her
5 HR AGO
She's gonna be driving soon, lol.
5 HR AGO
I told her she is a crazy strong example of genetics to me, she sounds like ann a lot
5 HR AGO
And has jeremys hair
4 HR AGO
Neat. When she was younger, I actually felt it was easier to see [[UJ]] in her. Yeah, the hair.
4 HR AGO
Yeah, she has anns smile now
4 HR AGO
But a lot of jeremy in the dace
4 HR AGO
Face
4 HR AGO
Hey, im gonna call your son now, then make some dinner and hit the hay
4 HR AGO
[[j3d1h]] has a WoW server in VM running on HTPC, but we're still getting the clients all setup for it. I'm hoping [[AG]] will play with us. I think it's just cheaper that way, and I think I'd rather tune the XP curve to move radically faster.
4 HR AGO
Yeah, that's cool! I'll let  him know you are calling
4 HR AGO
She would probably dig it if she only gets to 20
4 HR AGO
Sounds like she plays assassins creed more than wow
4 HR AGO
Love yah, talk for real tomorrow
4 HR AGO
Straight to voicemail
4 HR AGO
His phone is out of battery
4 HR AGO
call [[j3d1h]]
4 HR AGO
or me
4 HR AGO
Callin you
4 HR AGO
Lol straight to voicemail again
4 HR AGO
I am glad we have chat. That seems to be the only guaranteed method for you to reach me, lol.
