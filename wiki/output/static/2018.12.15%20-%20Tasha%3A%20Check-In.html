SAT 7:15 PM
I talked to Matthew very briefly, but I uh am so socially awkward I didn't do a good job connecting. You think he would enjoy chatting with me (he might not have the time)?
SAT 7:15 PM
How's the router, btw?
SAT 7:16 PM
We are good just getting ready for Christmas. I‚Äôm sure he enjoyed chatting with you and probably felt the same :see_no_evil::slightly_smiling_face: he can have a hard time tell he gets to know ya well enough!! The router is awesome not one single problem so far:hand_with_index_and_middle_fingers_crossed:
SAT 7:23 PM
Awesome. I am glad it is kicking butt.
SAT 7:27 PM
What you guys doing for Xmas?
SAT 7:27 PM
Opening presents and stuffing our face!
SAT 7:28 PM
That sounds like a fine plan, lol. =)
SAT 7:28 PM
Yup well since I work up until Christmas Day I have to do what I can
SAT 7:34 PM
Indeed.
SAT 7:34 PM
I hope you get paid well; you work a lot of hours.
SAT 7:34 PM
Inconvenient hours too.
SAT 7:34 PM
Yea I do but that absolutely about to change- I had to set some boundaries and she hired another full time person. I‚Äôm not saying I won‚Äôt work as much because we still have our business to run but I can‚Äôt be here 300 hrs in a month- no sir!
SAT 7:37 PM
How bout y‚Äôall any plans for Christmas :christmas_tree:
SAT 7:58 PM
Sorry for replying space trying to get these kiddos in pjs and chill time b4 bed
SAT 7:58 PM
Presents and mole at the Mexican restaurant next to the thrift shop (we can't make it mole).
SAT 7:58 PM
Oh yumm
SAT 7:59 PM
No, I am fine if it takes days for you to reply too. =) It is always my privilege when people choose to respond whenever they can.
SAT 7:59 PM
I can teach you sometime
SAT 7:59 PM
Uh, yes, please!
SAT 7:59 PM
It looks like only wizards can make that magical concoction.
SAT 8:00 PM
No problem
SAT 8:00 PM
I would literally drink it.
SAT 8:00 PM
(not joking)
SAT 8:00 PM
I like muh gravy
SAT 8:00 PM
:joy: :male_mage: at your service
SAT 8:00 PM
I know we owe you dinner and a game night too
SAT 8:01 PM
As soon as we can I definitely will be sending you an invite
SAT 8:01 PM
You don't owe us anything! We are happy to have neighbors that give a shit at all. Lol. I have a hard time making friends with any of my neighbors these days (but, I may be doing it wrong).
SAT 8:02 PM
But, we would be happy to get together again, of course.
SAT 8:02 PM
No worries and no you aren‚Äôt doing it wrong people aren‚Äôt always personable sometimes- it has nothing to do with you! We enjoy you guys very much and trust me are by far perfect!
SAT 8:04 PM</code></pre></div>
