 Life's pretty good man. Work some overtime today at work. It's nice to make a little extra money. Had a wild night Thursday night. A co-worker of 15 years is leaving for another job. So of course we threw him a going-away party at a bar. Unfortunately my tendencies for binge drinking overtook my rational thought of only having a few beers. Thank goodness I had a friend who also lives in Somerset drive me home.

 Still in the doghouse a little with the wife. But I didn't go to jail, I didn't get in a fight, as far as I know I'm still cool with all my co-workers. I can't tell you if I had a good time I blacked out. Pretty normal for my binge drinking. LOL. I do recall someone telling me you're drinking my tea quick T-Money you might want to slow down. I said sure of course. So each time I went to the restroom on the return back to the patio Kama I would stop and get a double shot at the bar before making my way back. LOL

 My son joined me a bit. I do the fingerpickin, and he does the strumming. '

 May convince my daughter to jump on the bango and wife on the fiddle. We'd be set.

 My best friend and I went on a fishing trip weekend before last. Found a cabin in the middle of nowhere east TN on the clinch River. We had 5 guitars up there! And more alcohol than a man should ever consume.

 Samantha is much more into singing and dancing I let her strum as well, but she will get bored quickly. We made a  usic video awhile back. I will have to send it to you when I'm on my pc.
