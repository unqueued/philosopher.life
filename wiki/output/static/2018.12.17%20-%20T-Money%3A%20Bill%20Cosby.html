SAT 12:23 PM
Doing well. The wiki is the best record.
SAT 12:34 PM
Lots of chores today.
SAT 12:34 PM
Kids helped me change a tire today.
SAT 12:34 PM
Nice to show them how to do that. Never had anyone show me in person.
SAT 12:35 PM
Flat tire sucks. But good moment to do it with kiddos.
SAT 12:35 PM
Yeah. Proud dad moment.
SAT 12:35 PM
I am also quite serious: the best way to get to know me is to hyperread that wiki.
SAT 12:36 PM
I think it is your window into me.
SAT 12:36 PM
I'm just pooping and texting. I don't know how far I wanna go into ?[[MWF]]? ?Last_Name?.
SAT 12:37 PM
Lol.
SAT 12:37 PM
I can swallow all your propaganda.
SAT 12:37 PM
Well, that is what friendship is about.
SAT 12:37 PM
Hahaha
SAT 12:37 PM
It's about empathizing with each other, developing effective models of each others' minds, and constituting ourselves with [[The Golden Rule]].
SAT 12:38 PM
Of course you are free to disagree with me.
SAT 12:38 PM
I've yet to encounter someone who didn't.
SAT 12:38 PM
But, my goal is to evolve beyond shallow relationships, and it's hard to do that without very consistent, high bandwidth exchanges.
SAT 12:39 PM
I agree, I want to evolve past shallow aquantices. And you are an awesome person I want to get to know better. I am also very guarded, due to 99% of the people I talk to are shallow and that us the end of it.
SAT 12:45 PM
I am moving toward that, with you. I'd like to. But it will take me time. To learn again. How to make a real friend. So don't disregard my messages as vain or superficial. Shallow I deed, but I'm evolving myself.
SAT 12:47 PM
Shallow indeed
SAT 12:47 PM
Well, I will evolve with you! =)
SAT 12:48 PM
Also we are wired differently. I have to stay guarded to to my very emotional nature.
SAT 12:48 PM
I hear ya. My wiki is highly emotional as well. In part, it serves to contain the contagion.
SAT 12:49 PM
Often to help redirect and shape it into something meaningful and not destructive (if I can help it).
SAT 12:49 PM
We are wired differently too. I can appreciate that (even if I don't exactly understand how you are wired [though, I don't understand how I'm really wired either]).
SAT 12:50 PM
I like it. And I have looked at your wiki alot. Just not the I  depth over my head stuff.
SAT 12:50 PM
If I have to Google 4 words. I'm in too deep
SAT 12:51 PM
Haha
SAT 12:51 PM
It may also be useful to understand the overall structure (which doesn't require understanding the words that much) and to search it. Also, you can download the entire thing (in case you ever need to read it offline).
SAT 12:52 PM
I would also be interested to read your writing. I know you did in college, and you may still (or one day do so again). It will be how I come to learn who you are, to think about you.
SAT 12:54 PM
I'm afraid alot of my writing was mainly to attempt to utilize new vocabularies and impress girls, and capture the essance of my depressions and teenage angst.
SAT 1:00 PM
Mostly all poetry, or spoken word style. I have an online journal. But you can read it in prolly 10min.
SAT 1:01 PM
Most recent date mybe 08. Lol
SAT 1:01 PM
http://owenmeany.deadjournal.com
SAT 1:02 PM
I will catch up on some of your wiki, and I will pic something and write in  &quot;long text&quot; to you.
SAT 1:02 PM
My evolution and effort.
SAT 1:03 PM
I will be reading and thinking about your journal. I love that Owen Meany is the choice. We will always have that book in common. It has shaped me profoundly.
SAT 1:04 PM
My dog is named Owen.
SAT 1:04 PM
I would adore a letter from you. Sometimes writing affords us the chance to select who will be (to some [[dok]]).
SAT 1:05 PM
Lol.
SAT 1:05 PM
Noice. =)
SAT 1:05 PM

Thus dog is owen
SAT 1:05 PM
He is still alive. But also the reason I do so much for my dog like the big heated dog house and shit. He was a rescue who was afraid of men. He taught me patients, love, and even forgiveness from pain. He was integral to me before I had a child. He is trained off leash and will pretrey much read my mind and do what I ask of him. Knows hand signals and my grunts lol
SAT 1:08 PM
Animals teach us empathy.

SAT 1:09 PM
He is 10 years old. Has always been very skinny. Good s to vet twice a year for checkups. Everyone thinks he has worms.... Lol. I have to explain that's just how he is.
SAT 1:10 PM
He has anxiety but hides it well. Similar to me. Indeed. Empathy he has taught.. Me. Only a few more years left with him. So I want him to be a comfortable and healthy as appropriate.
SAT 1:12 PM
Still a dog no less. Wife knew a kid named own and she didn't like him so I couldn't name our son Owen. So I named the dog. Haha
SAT 1:13 PM
We never had a son. But. That's how the convo went.
SAT 1:13 PM
I remember some of these words from 2003 and 2004.
SAT 4:46 PM
:yum:

SAT 7:00 PM
Found at the peddlers mall. Hahahah
SAT 7:00 PM
That is his mid-rape O-face.

SAT 7:10 PM
I have his autograph. My mom got it when we lived in Atlanta on my BDay web en I was like 4
SAT 7:11 PM
I can't read it. Who signed it?
SAT 7:11 PM
What do you think about it?
SAT 7:12 PM
&quot;bill Cosby happy birthday&quot; written on the back of directions.
SAT 7:12 PM
omg
SAT 7:13 PM
lol
SAT 7:13 PM
That is touching.
SAT 7:13 PM
Time to learn how to imitate that cursive and continue the joke.
SAT 7:14 PM
I framed it before the scandal... I just got it hung up in my man cave... What Evers.
SAT 7:15 PM
How do I send you the letter? Email? Sync?
SAT 10:02 PM
Not finished but will tonight. As much as I csn muster.
SAT 10:02 PM
I am honored! Please feel free to take your time writing it. I'm working on a letter than has taken me a month (I am a slow writer, homie): https://philosopher.life/#2018.11.21%20-%20Sphygmus%3A%20Thanksgiving:%5B%5B2018.11.21%20-%20Sphygmus%3A%20Thanksgiving%5D%5D
SAT 10:09 PM
h0p3@protonmail.com
SAT 10:09 PM
The sync is also an excellent choice!
SAT 10:10 PM
If you want to spend 10 minutes, I can help you have a wiki running too, and you can sync that to me. Some things are hard to express in a single letter.
SAT 10:10 PM
That's how my brother AIR writes to me (syncing his wiki to me).
SAT 10:11 PM
Indeed. No wiki for me. I appriciate it. This letter is a very helter skelter haphazard nonsense. But. First letter I have written in decades.
SAT 10:12 PM
It is human. Thank you. =)
SAT 10:12 PM
As we move towards specific topics I suspect more focused discussion. I
