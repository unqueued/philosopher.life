Fri 8:56 PM
 It‚Äôs going well actually!
Fri 8:56 PM
 \o/
Fri 8:57 PM
 I feel better than I have in awhile. Getting sleep is a miracle.
Fri 8:57 PM
 That is excellent news!
Fri 8:57 PM
 How is [[K]]?
Fri 8:57 PM
 He‚Äôs still hanging in there. He‚Äôs still very worried about Chase.
Fri 8:57 PM
 =(
Fri 8:58 PM
 He‚Äôs told him exactly how to get the money he needs to stay in school and it doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs done anything about t.
Fri 8:59 PM
 Er, it*
Fri 8:59 PM
 I am so sorry.
Fri 9:00 PM
 We keep trying to reach out to him for help or anything he needs and he either lies or doesn‚Äôt respond.
Fri 9:00 PM
 Or gets mad for [[K]] helping him.
Fri 9:00 PM
 I can feel it in my chest.
Fri 9:01 PM
 I‚Äôm really not sure what to do here except drag him to get help at a doctor‚Äôs office that I can‚Äôt afford.
Fri 9:00 PM
 Truthfully it seems like he doesn‚Äôt want help and I don‚Äôt know how to address that.
Fri 9:01 PM
 me neither, it feels like a nightmare
Fri 9:02 PM
 like you are watching him throw it away
Fri 9:02 PM
 if I'm feeling this (and [[JRE]]), then [[K]] must be getting drowned
Fri 9:02 PM
 We‚Äôre worried if we invite him to live with us he‚Äôll just waste away here and we can‚Äôt really afford to feed another mouth without more income.
Fri 9:02 PM
 And we KNOW if we tell his mom she‚Äôs not going to do anything constructive about it.
Fri 9:03 PM
 Is his physical illness he's been fighting related to this at all?
Fri 9:03 PM
 aye!
Fri 9:03 PM
 Yeah... he says he thinks about it 24/7
Fri 9:03 PM
 Who, [[K]]? Or Chase?
Fri 9:04 PM
 [[K]]
Fri 9:04 PM
 he's been getting better, but it is slower than I expected
Fri 9:04 PM
 Well a large part of that is because he pushed himself WAY too much when he was sick.
Fri 9:05 PM
 But this could be part of it too.
Fri 9:05 PM
 I'm completely useless to [[K]], but I will actively listen with everything I have for him if he can use me.
Fri 9:05 PM
 He wears stress like a badge.
Fri 9:05 PM
 I know... he does appreciate it though.
Fri 9:06 PM
 I keep trying to think of solutions but they all seem to come up short. :(
Fri 9:06 PM
 I can see how hard you are trying! You are doing your best.
Fri 9:07 PM
 [[K]] seems more and more worried that Chase will end up on the street or worse.
Fri 9:07 PM
 Yes.
Fri 9:07 PM
 How do you help someone that doesn‚Äôt want help??
Fri 9:08 PM
 (I have a tendency to freak out earlier than I should. I could be very wrong about this. My alarm bells for Chase and [[K]] are going off though!)
Fri 9:09 PM
 I know.
Fri 9:09 PM
 If I knew the answer, my brother [[AIR]] would not have suffered for so long.
Fri 9:09 PM
 Honestly [[K]] is handling this better than I‚Äôve seen him handle things in the past... but I think that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs used to his siblings doing irrational things.
Fri 9:09 PM
 hehe
Fri 9:09 PM
 He's a good man.
Fri 9:09 PM
 He is.
Fri 9:10 PM
 He really just wants them to be happy... and I want to help him see that through. I wish I was in a better position to do so though.
Fri 9:11 PM
 You are the anchor.
Fri 9:14 PM
 So, anyways, what you up to this weekend?
Fri 9:15 PM
 Sorry, got caught up playin Minecraft with the niece
Fri 10:21 PM
 We have D&amp;D tomorrow and then we‚Äôre having Chase over Sunday...
Fri 10:21 PM
 you sound so old when you say that sentence
Fri 10:21 PM
 lol...
Fri 10:21 PM
 both are excellent!
Fri 10:22 PM
 We‚Äôre all old when she‚Äôs around.
Fri 10:21 PM
 I‚Äôm hoping we can get through to him more in person... we‚Äôll see.
Fri 10:22 PM
 Idk how to gracefully approach this or it if would just be better to punch my hand through the glass, so to speak.
Fri 10:22 PM
 You are far more knowledgeable about this issue that I am. I can feel the heat though. You know me: I'm blunt. I think I'd be tempted to say, &quot;I don't know what you are going through; you can make this work if you want. Either way, I love you. Let's just have fun tonight.&quot; I'd be most concerned about making sure he knows he's safe with you, that he can talk to you about anything, and that when he's ready to step up to the plate to bat, you'll be there with him. Easier said than done! I'm sure you will find a worthy approach (obviously, I have failed...so maybe that is exactly what you shouldn't do, lol).
Fri 10:27 PM
 Definitely easier said than done.
Fri 10:29 PM
 But thank you for listening to me rant.
Fri 10:29 PM
 I appreciate it ‚Äî sometimes I need a sounding board.
Fri 10:29 PM
 You aren't ranting, and if you want me to stop spilling my guts/opinions, please tell me (you won't hurt my feeling...I'm trying to give you anything I have...knowing full well it may be useless to you).
Fri 10:29 PM
 Nono, you‚Äôre fine.
Fri 10:29 PM
 I talk to you not just to have someone listen but because I want to hear what you have to say.
Fri 10:30 PM
 Same!
Fri 10:30 PM
 I value your thoughts.
Fri 10:30 PM
 And I know that you will try to be as rational as possible which is something I need.
Fri 10:30 PM
 speaking of unreason, my wife encouraged me to find a vidya game to play
Fri 10:32 PM
 gonna find some braincandy
Fri 10:32 PM
 Hmmm
Fri 10:32 PM
 What kind of brain candy?
Fri 10:32 PM
 Puzzlers? Platformers? Shooters?
Fri 10:32 PM
 also, watching &quot;Sharp Objects&quot;...[[JRE]] recommended. Emotionally charged, very difficult to watch. Excellent show.
Fri 10:33 PM
 I saw that. My list is growing... I should stop making it metaphorically in my head and actually write them down somewhere...
Fri 10:33 PM
 You know, my problem with my games is that I throw myself too far into them. They become my obsession. I want a game that I can't obsess over, but still fart around on correctly?
Fri 10:33 PM
 Hmmm....
Fri 10:33 PM
 One that is satisfying in small doses...
Fri 10:33 PM
 preferably...if I spend too much time, defeats the purpose
Fri 10:34 PM
 Right.
Fri 10:34 PM
 a flash game might be best...won't have too much depth
Fri 10:34 PM
 Right.
Fri 10:34 PM
 I know what I want to play
Fri 10:34 PM
 with my son especially
Fri 10:34 PM
 Hm?
Fri 10:34 PM
 but, I think it will suck me in
Fri 10:35 PM
 and own me
Fri 10:35 PM
 Hehe
Fri 10:34 PM
 Divinity: Original Sin 2
Fri 10:35 PM
 seen my brother play, watched my son play it...
Fri 10:35 PM
 looks hella fun
Fri 10:35 PM
 Okay, haven‚Äôt played it but heard it‚Äôs good
Fri 10:35 PM
 I bet [[K]] could tell me aaaaaall about it lol
Fri 10:36 PM
 you know a game is good when you can metagame with others about it having never played it...I've talked for hours about that game...never even touched it.
Fri 10:36 PM
 lol
Fri 10:36 PM
 That‚Äôs awesome.
Fri 10:36 PM
 [[L]], tell me to go get some o'dat Crack Cocaine!
Fri 10:37 PM
 lol
Fri 10:37 PM
 I think I want to show you Super Mario Odyssey actually. Very sweet, fun platformer with incredibly smooth controls.
Fri 10:37 PM
 googling
Fri 10:37 PM
 (btw, I like when you make me google)
Fri 10:37 PM
 It‚Äôs the latest Mario platformer
Fri 10:37 PM
 Very very well done
Fri 10:37 PM
 It‚Äôs super fun to break too. The game rewards you well for getting places you ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù
Fri 10:38 PM
 Plus it‚Äôs cute and colorful!
Fri 10:38 PM
 Super Mario 64 is a very special game to me...and I say that as somehow who didn't actually play through it, but watched others do so many times.
Fri 10:38 PM
 Right. This is almost a throwback to that in a way.
Fri 10:39 PM
 Super Mario 64 has a fuckton of those speedruns, ghetto hack things too!
Fri 10:39 PM
 Well... a spiritual successor if you will. Not exactly like it.
Fri 10:39 PM
 Aye
Fri 10:39 PM
 But the controls are VERY similar.
Fri 10:39 PM
 I think you‚Äôd enjoy watching it too. Especially while on something. XD
Fri 10:40 PM
 lol
Fri 10:40 PM
 So. Many. Colors.
Fri 10:40 PM
 There  are only two games I've enjoyed watching while high
Fri 10:40 PM
 Ori and the Blind Forest
Fri 10:41 PM
 Which is beautiful
Fri 10:41 PM
 Spoilers ‚Äî I bought that one awhile back. XD
Fri 10:41 PM
 Still need to play it.
Fri 10:41 PM
 (Sorry, continue)
Fri 10:41 PM
 Not my kind of game, but it's really beautiful
Fri 10:41 PM
 and this weird game I've never heard of call &quot;Devil's Tuning Fork&quot;
Fri 10:42 PM
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tKF_subEMA
Fri 10:42 PM
 game is every bit of scary as you might imagine
Fri 10:43 PM
 (I don't like scary)
Fri 10:43 PM
 Interesting
Fri 10:44 PM
 I love the style ‚Äî very unique. I could actually see that being a game with a happy flavor, but I could see the lean towards horror because of the sparse visual feedback
Fri 10:45 PM
 yes
Fri 10:45 PM
 Why are the cool things always scary? .__.
Fri 10:46 PM
 lol
Fri 10:46 PM
 often because they force you, &quot;in your face,&quot; to recognize that appearances are deceiving, to question your own reality, etc.
Fri 10:46 PM
 2 spooky 4 me
Fri 10:47 PM
 lol
Fri 10:47 PM
 [[K]] has made me used to horro xD
Fri 10:47 PM
 Horror**
Fri 10:47 PM
 We watched this terrifying animatronic-based horror game play through for YEARS
Fri 10:47 PM
 lol
Fri 10:48 PM
 Creator kept making good sequels to build a story and he got me hooked.
Fri 10:48 PM
 And that was back when I lived alone too. XD
Fri 10:48 PM
 You know...I've never actually lived alone.
Fri 10:48 PM
 Not nearly as fun as people make it seem.
Fri 10:48 PM
 Sure I didn‚Äôt have to pick up after myself as much but damn nightmares were never fun to have.
Fri 10:49 PM
 I'm not sure I could do it.
Fri 10:49 PM
 I don‚Äôt think I ever would again if I could help it.
Fri 10:49 PM
 Shit can't be healthy for you.
Fri 10:49 PM
 ^^^^^^
Fri 10:49 PM
 We‚Äôre too social to live alone for long.
Fri 10:49 PM
 and, I agree with you as an anti-social misanthrope
Fri 10:50 PM
 even people in prison lift weight and shave each other simply for skin hunger
Fri 10:50 PM
 in Lord of the Flies, we still seek The Other
Fri 10:51 PM
 Yup
Fri 10:51 PM
 [[L]], you always give me hope.
Fri 10:51 PM
 Oh?
Fri 10:51 PM
 lol
Fri 10:51 PM
 I suppose I tend to vomit the stuff. XD But I‚Äôm glad!
Fri 10:51 PM
 I‚Äôm not even trying. HURRAH! \o/
Fri 10:52 PM
 lol
Fri 10:52 PM
 So what I‚Äôm hearing is
Fri 10:52 PM
 That you are awesome, and I love you.
Fri 10:52 PM
 D‚Äôaw
Fri 10:52 PM
 I love you too
Fri 10:52 PM
 I more meant that we should all buy a house and be bums in it together.
Fri 10:52 PM
 /high-5
Fri 10:53 PM
 But I appreciate the way you switched it up xD
Fri 10:53 PM
 
Fri 10:53 PM
 I got you fam
Fri 10:53 PM
 lol
Fri 10:53 PM
 You are excellent at coming up with the fitting gif for the occasion.
Fri 10:53 PM
 [[L]] the Gif-Giver, I dub thee
Fri 10:54 PM
 So. Much. Practice.
Fri 10:54 PM
 Yessssss
Fri 10:54 PM
 
Fri 10:54 PM
 I now read full stops as /claps in my head: &quot;So, /clap; Much, /clap; Practice, /slap&quot;
Fri 10:55 PM
 rofl
Fri 10:55 PM
 xD
Fri 10:55 PM
 The internet is getting to you.
Fri 10:55 PM
 Or you‚Äôre reading too many twitter/tumbler rants....
Fri 10:55 PM
 unfortunately, I feel like I'm supposed to know where that gif is from, but I don't know
Fri 10:55 PM
 Nope, me neither.
Fri 10:55 PM
 Just a lady putting a crown on her head.
Fri 10:55 PM
 you just got off the &quot;feel&quot; of the image
Fri 10:56 PM
 Actually that might be Beyonc√©.
Fri 10:56 PM
 Muahahaaa
Fri 10:56 PM
 Cna't be...I say that as a man with: So. Much. Practice.
Fri 10:56 PM
 Heheheh.
Fri 10:56 PM
 Alright, so you have a list of games for me try, right?
Fri 10:57 PM
 I‚Äôd have to think bout it.
Fri 10:57 PM
 and, when I spiral into addiction, I'll be like...the ~devil~ [[L]] made me do it.
Fri 10:57 PM
 The constraint of ‚Äúpleasant in small doses‚Äù is thought provoking. P
Fri 10:57 PM
 lololol
Fri 10:57 PM
 /searches-4-devil.gif
Fri 10:58 PM
 The blind leading the blind
Fri 10:58 PM
 I know that feel
Fri 10:58 PM
 
Fri 10:58 PM
 =)
Fri 10:59 PM
 I live to serve.
Fri 10:59 PM
 Hehehe
Fri 10:59 PM
 Alright, so now I need to come up with a very hard to find thing to represent in a gif
Fri 10:59 PM
 kind of like coming up with a difficult 20 questions choice
Fri 10:59 PM
 Which translates to a think I don‚Äôt have a reference for...
Fri 10:59 PM
 XD
Fri 10:59 PM
 Thing**
Fri 10:59 PM
 I have a game for you, a dumb one that you should avoid because...it's dumb.
Fri 11:01 PM
 I have literally no one to talk about it with, but I see something cool in it...after you crazy with it: https://www.kongregate.com/games/void/hack-slash-crawl
Fri 11:01 PM
 
Fri 11:01 PM
 lol
Fri 11:02 PM
 I‚Äôll have to open it on my computer in the mernin‚Äô
Fri 11:02 PM
 I amazed you can do this on a phone. It's black magic.
Fri 11:02 PM
 It screamed at me when I tried to open it on my phone. XD
Fri 11:02 PM
 Lol!
Fri 11:02 PM
 I can barely type on a keyboard, let alone a phone.
Fri 11:03 PM
 It is the culture I grew up with. Almost second nature honestly.
Fri 11:03 PM
 I do have a very nice foldable bluetooth keyboard for my phone (which has a stand on it's protector/guard/whateverthingy)
Fri 11:03 PM
 Count me incredibly envious
Fri 11:03 PM
 Which is neat-o :3
Fri 11:03 PM
 If a keyboard would fit in my stupid girl pockets I totally would.
Fri 11:04 PM
 aye....like an instant &quot;laptop&quot;
Fri 11:04 PM
 Fucking clothing industry...
Fri 11:04 PM
 I've been begging [[k0sh3k]] to learn how to make pockets for a very long time.
Fri 11:04 PM
 Maybe I should just do it for her.
Fri 11:04 PM
 That would be a badass gift for my wife.
Fri 11:04 PM
 It‚Äôs not actually that hard.
Fri 11:04 PM
 (well...I'm like clinically retarded for that stuff...so...probably hard for me).
Fri 11:05 PM
 Fair point. I also had sewing classes as a kid. XD
Fri 11:05 PM
 wait...have you done this before?
Fri 11:05 PM
 what?
Fri 11:05 PM
 I don't remember that.
Fri 11:05 PM
 No but I could.
Fri 11:05 PM
 so many things I don't know
Fri 11:05 PM
 I took them at Emily‚Äôs house. Mom got me a sewing machine any everything
Fri 11:05 PM
 wow, neat
Fri 11:06 PM
 [[JRE]] saw her the other day...
Fri 11:06 PM
 in Louisville
Fri 11:06 PM
 I actually sewed part of my latest cosplay myself because I didn‚Äôt feel like buying it.
Fri 11:06 PM
 Oh? :o
Fri 11:06 PM
 Wonder what she was doing.
Fri 11:06 PM
 apparently, her body language was signaling the whole time she had no interest in maintaining a multi-minute conversation with him, lol
Fri 11:06 PM
 RIP
Fri 11:06 PM
 being a selfish asshole, if I understand correctly
Fri 11:07 PM
 Huh. That‚Äôs weird, she‚Äôs usually down to talk to random people she sees.
Fri 11:07 PM
 Maybe that‚Äôs just when I‚Äôm around and waiting on her to go somewhere...
Fri 11:07 PM
 [[JRE]] offers her no benefits
Fri 11:07 PM
 Are we supposed to call him [[JRE]] now? Cause I‚Äôll have to train myself to do that.
Fri 11:08 PM
 Sorry, off topic. What do you mean by benefits here?
Fri 11:08 PM
 I'm trying to call him [[JRE]].
Fri 11:08 PM
 Well...since he may read this (and now that I'm thinking about it, I will point it out...since he purposely tries to troll me in our own chat)...something, something penis joke.
Fri 11:09 PM
 In reality, I don't think she cares about a relationship with him.
Fri 11:09 PM
 Bah
Fri 11:09 PM
 (I'm a skeptical person, [[L]])
Fri 11:10 PM
 It's cool that you sewed your own costume, btw.
Fri 11:10 PM
 No, I mean bah toward her.
Fri 11:10 PM
 lol
Fri 11:10 PM
 (Thank you)
Fri 11:10 PM
 What parts did you sew?
Fri 11:10 PM
 [[JRE]]-billy-bob is cool.
Fri 11:10 PM
 He is the strangest blend of rational,  thought provoking, and comical and I love it.
Fri 11:11 PM
 Can we have more of him please?
Fri 11:11 PM
 Sometimes he is my own father.
Fri 11:11 PM
 (I mean that with legitimate, high respect)
Fri 11:12 PM
 How so?
Fri 11:12 PM
 I know you do. You don‚Äôt make statements like that lightly.
Fri 11:12 PM
 Because when I ask who I want to be as a father to my son, I look to my brother and who he is with me.
Fri 11:13 PM
 Jesus. I'm literally in tears now.
Fri 11:13 PM
 Aw...
Fri 11:14 PM
 That‚Äôs sweet.
Fri 11:14 PM
 If you haven‚Äôt told him that you really should.
Fri 11:14 PM
 I have.
Fri 11:14 PM
 I don't think he believes me.
Fri 11:14 PM
 Good.
Fri 11:14 PM
 JIM
Fri 11:14 PM
 lol
Fri 11:14 PM
 [[h0p3]] DOESN‚ÄôT CRY FOR JUST ANYTHING

Fri 11:15 PM
 Have fun pasting this in your wiki btw xD
Fri 11:15 PM
 I will!

 Our insanity, forever documented \o/
Fri 11:15 PM
 I have a book for you
Fri 11:16 PM
 a pure fantasy novel

 You have my attention.

 I never do.

Fri 11:18 PM
 I have convinced my wife to get rid of half our physical books...a huge sacrifice on her part
Fri 11:19 PM
 I heard!
Fri 11:19 PM
 How is she taking it?
Fri 11:19 PM
 When she doesn't think about it, just fine!
Fri 11:19 PM
 lol
Fri 11:19 PM
 Perfect!
Fri 11:19 PM
 Slip them out the door when she‚Äôs not looking.
Fri 11:20 PM
 Will take them to &quot;Mr. K's&quot; for store credit to buy....more books. Lol.
Fri 11:20 PM
 Of course.
Fri 11:20 PM
 It‚Äôs an endless cycle.
Fri 11:20 PM
 Okay but I seriously want to smell a book now. Damn it. Why is the bookshelf so far awaaaaay
Fri 11:22 PM
 You know how coffee cuts through sweet...makes a nice dialectical rotation on your tastebuds? ....what is the parallel &quot;smell&quot; rotation (knowing that olfactory and taste are related)?
Fri 11:23 PM
 booksmell -&gt; ???
Fri 11:23 PM
 Hmmmm
Fri 11:23 PM
 what is Scent Heaven?
Fri 11:24 PM
 Okay hear me out

Fri 11:24 PM
 Have you ever eaten edible paper?
Fri 11:24 PM
 wat
Fri 11:24 PM
 googling
Fri 11:24 PM
 Books smell the way it tastes. XD
Fri 11:24 PM
 And don‚Äôt mean the drug kind.
Fri 11:24 PM
 read a page, eat a page
Fri 11:25 PM
 It was kinda sweet but still had a papery smell.
Fri 11:25 PM
 And it dissolved on the tongue almost completely if you left it there long enough.
Fri 11:25 PM
 (Which I did because I‚Äôm strange)
Fri 11:26 PM
 sounds like it could make a neat pastry
Fri 11:26 PM
 Definitely
Fri 11:26 PM
 It was likely sweetened to make it more fun to eat anyways
Fri 11:26 PM
 But it could almost be like a puff pastry
Fri 11:27 PM
 But less.. crunchy?
Fri 11:27 PM
 No, less brittle. That‚Äôs the word I meant.
Fri 11:27 PM
 I‚Äôm too tired for semantics. XD
Fri 11:27 PM
 That IS tired.
Fri 11:28 PM
 Hehehehe

Fri 11:28 PM
 in case you didn't want to go through the rigamarole of hosting
Fri 11:28 PM
 (or forcing friends to use tools like Resilio Sync)
Fri 11:29 PM
 Fancy :o
Fri 11:29 PM
 Right
Fri 11:29 PM
 Smart!
Fri 11:29 PM
 You can (and should) keep local copies. But, they can be uploaded automagically too to that site.
Fri 11:30 PM
 My players are adoring the wiki I made for them btw
Fri 11:29 PM
 Nice.
Fri 11:30 PM
 Good!
Fri 11:30 PM
 As always your suggestions are golden.
Fri 11:30 PM
 Plus they‚Äôre computer engineers, so any software this well thought out is just a marvel to them.
Fri 11:30 PM
 Indeed, TW is a marvel! I have a very hard time describing what it is.
Fri 11:31 PM
 A thing where I can say as much as I want to and still keep it reasonably organized and compact.
Fri 11:35 PM
 Maybe?
Fri 11:35 PM
 That is definitely true.
Fri 11:35 PM
 Most people do not use TW like I do. The more technically competent folks use it as a frontend UI sitting on top of backend servers.
Fri 11:36 PM
 It's flexibility is hard to describe.
Fri 11:36 PM
 It‚Äôs magic \o/
Fri 11:37 PM
 dun!
Fri 11:37 PM
