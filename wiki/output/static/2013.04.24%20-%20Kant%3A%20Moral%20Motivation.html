I suppose this immediacy requirement prevents the determination via the wrong sorts of forces (inclinations, etc.).</p><p>I really don‚Äôt fully understand what Kant means by moral feeling (hell, I‚Äôm not sure what I mean by it).2 Naively, it seems like a moral feeling is, at least in part, some special sort of joy/ pleasure or sorrow/pain one experiences because we are aware of selecting an action in or not accordance with (and perhaps even in or not virtue of, motivationally speaking) the moral law. I‚Äôd almost want to call it a rational kind of feeling (whatever that means), as this moral feeling seems highly connected to some kind of rational respect for the moral law. In some ways, it really isn‚Äôt very analogous to other kinds of ordinary feelings. It isn‚Äôt like sadness or anger, and it is not the warm-fuzzy feeling (a selfish kind of feeling if you ask me) one might get when doing something nice for someone else. Presumably, it is deeper than that (I‚Äôm doing a terrible job here, but I hope you understand what I‚Äôm getting at). One hopes the source of this moral feeling is somehow different than our other ordinary, fleeting, capricious feelings. We should be worried whether or not moral feelings should play any sort of role in motivating us to be moral (and why, how, and to what extent, etc.). I hope we flesh this out in class. Perhaps we could dissect and outline the sad philanthropist example regarding this topic.</p><p>Kant explains, ‚ÄúTherefore respect for the moral law must be regarded as also a positive though indirect effect of the moral law on feeling insofar as the law weakens the hindering influence of the inclinations by humiliating self-conceit.‚Äù3 This is fascinating approach, and I have seen it elsewhere. This is very similar to an argument virtue ethicists give us. It goes something like this: the virtuous agent has the ability to quell or suppress the inclinations, feelings, etc. which are not appropriate to the morally salient aspects of particular circumstances. The virtuous agent has the right sorts of feelings, inclinations, or whatever to subdue or negate those influences within herself which might hinder being moral.</p><p>This isn‚Äôt for class, but if you have any direction to give me for reading: I‚Äôd like to see an analysis of how theology influenced his work.4 The examination of divine will has a storied past, and it would be interesting to see Kant‚Äôs particular background on the matter.
