<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>How many people believe God is timeless? How about temporal?</p><p>Argument style isn’t so much “lay out opponent’s view” then “show what’s wrong with it” then “provide an alternative view.” McCann generally employs a tit-for-tat, to-and-fro strategy. Concise and action packed, but it isn’t cleanly organized and outlined like Davis’.</p><p>Overall argument, he says:</p><p>No reason to think a timelessly eternal God cannot create or alter events in the world.</p><p>(not a positive argument, just a defensive one)</p><p>Only a timeless creator can exercise rational and complete sovereignty over creation.</p><p>(positive, and attack on sempiternal/everlastingness/temporal view)</p><p>A time-bound God has limited knowledge of tensed propositions, whereas timeless God’s knowledge is complete.</p><p>Section I:</p><p>McCann doesn’t want us to take the Bible too literally.</p><p>Space analogy to time. He then turns around and employs Biblical tenses literally.</p><p>McCann’s scriptural interpretation requires that God is the “Creator of everything but [H]imself…ruling the universe with complete power and authority,” which must definitionally include creating and having absolute power over time.</p><p>A temporal God may lack omniscience, particularly with respect to human free will.</p><p>Divine essence is incompatible with change (immutable). God’s necessity and immutability require he is timeless.</p><p>McCann claims there has to be an explanation for accidental features, and any such explanation would have to be something external to God.</p><p>McCann thinks none of God’s features can be dependent on anything external to God</p><p>God has no accidental features.</p><p>If God were temporal, then He’d have accidental features.</p><p>God isn’t temporal; He’s timeless.</p><p>Section II:</p><p>Reasons to doubt atemporal entities and states of affairs:</p><p>Time becomes an illusion</p><p>McCann rebuts by agreeing to space analogy, and space isn’t illusory.</p><p>Interestingly, McCann and Davis disagree on what this analogy really shows</p><p>Further, just because God isn’t “in time” doesn’t mean time is unreal.</p><p>Doubt a Timeless Entity</p><p>Ambiguous or misleading expression of the Timeless thesis; “eternal present” or “simultaneous present” imply temporal notions.</p><p>Particularly, implies God’s act of experiencing the world is itself temporal</p><p>These are just stepping stones to convey transcendence</p><p>These convey that God’s experience has no “serial presentation” or “alteration” of content</p><p>He is aware of the temporal, but His awareness is not temporal.</p><p>Doubt a Timeless state of affairs</p><p>No need for timeless states of affairs, except for this “God problem,” and we’ve merely invented the notion that God is timeless because we are unable to comprehend a temporal God.</p><p>Rebuts that we do have need and understanding of timeless states of affairs: mathematics.</p><p>Atemporalist disagrees with the claim that mathematics is timeless, and thinks we’ve artificially extended our metaphysical ontology. Proposes replacing timeless with “omnitemporal,” unchanging but temporal realities.</p><p>Rebuts Omnitemporal replacement by considering how the view would be endorsed or expressed:</p><p>Temporalist thinks the atemporalist can’t agree to (a) and (b)</p><p>(a) There are no timelessly eternal states of affairs</p><p>(b) There is no timelessly eternal God</p><p>Rebut, atemporalist cannot reject these if we understand them from the sempiternalist, presumably omnitemporal, view. (a) and (b), on a such a view, are equivalent to:</p><p>(c) There never have been, are not now, and never will be any timelessly eternal states of affairs.</p><p>(d) There never has been, is not now, and never will be a timelessly eternal God</p><p>Atemporalist must agree to (c) and (d), and thus (a) and (b) given the equivalence, since they deny temporal existence pertains to a timeless entity.</p><p>(a) and (b) can’t be taken as temporal statements, otherwise there is no disagreement. Instead, they have to be taken as atemporal statements, but then the temporalist can’t double a timeless state of affairs.</p><p>Assumes reductionist view of time, which enables him to go timeless on mathematics</p><p>Supposedly, mathematical entities don’t change, and they aren’t empirical.</p><p>Relational changes, but not intrinsic changes. What exactly does this mean?</p><p>McCann denies the “meaninglessness” of temporal terms charge from Davis, and instead says they are just false (to be fair, Davis may have anticipated this with the “necessarily false” claim after meaningless).</p><p>Section III:</p><p>Doubt that God can be Creator and Intervener if He isn’t in time.</p><p>Assumes that production of change and being an active agent share the same time stamps – “causation itself is…intrinsically temporal”</p><p>Rebut that causation isn’t a process</p><p>Causation isn’t a kind of change</p><p>Causation is relation of explanation, holding one thing accountable for the occurrence of another thing</p><p>No gaps in natural causal stories, so producing an effect and being active have the same time stamp for humans.</p><p>God’s causation could have a gap.</p><p>He didn’t use natural processes to create the universe</p><p>His creative power may not be limited like ours, especially by natural principles external to Him</p><p>He creates ex nihilo, and not due to changes in Him</p><p>There was no “t” at which to create the world and time.</p><p>God sustains the world.</p><p>God cannot be temporally eternal because:</p><p>If God were in time, then He didn’t create it.</p><p>There is something besides God that He didn’t create.</p><p>Thus, He isn’t the Creator.</p><p>If God were in time, he’d have to decide when to produce the world.</p><p>This might require changes in God.</p><p>God would need reasons, and McCann can’t come up with reasons, thus God wouldn’t have a reason.</p><p>If God were in time, he would be restricted by something external to Him.</p><p>God would be a slave to time.</p><p>God isn’t a restricted slave, thus He isn’t in time.</p><p>Section IV:</p><p>For God to be Omniscient, for all propositions which are true or false, He knows that they are true, or that they are false. Only a timeless God can be omniscient.</p><p>It isn’t clear how a temporal God could know truth values of propositions concerning future events.</p><p>Assumes these propositions have truth values</p><p>Again, how could a temporal God know the outcomes or choices of freewill beforehand?</p><p>A timeless God knows the propositions which are true or false for all history in a “single act of awareness.”</p><p>Sempiternalist counterattack</p><p>(e) “John is mowing his lawn” is not reporting a timeless state of affairs.</p><p>Semantics of (e) regard “now” and “present”.</p><p>Tensed statements are indexed to a certain temporal location.</p><p>Knowing which tensed statements are true requiring know “what the present moment is,” which a timeless God can’t know.</p><p>Thus, not only can a timeless God not know the truth of (e), he can’t know any tensed propositions.</p><p>Sources of Error for this counterattack:</p><p>Spatial Analogy Riposte</p><p>Analogy of spatially indexed propositioned.</p><p>If God is omniscient, then He knows it is raining here.</p><p>No one argues God has to be “in space” to know that.</p><p>Tensed propositions involve a perspective on the world of change, but they say nothing about anyone occupying that perspective.</p><p>Assumption that “Tensed propositions change their truth value”</p><p>Each assertion of a tensed sentence is a different proposition.</p><p>Assumption: False before, True while present, and False after.</p><p>Assumption that we are asserting the same proposition in each context.</p><p>More careful way to express (e), namely (f):</p><p>(f) “John is (this moment) mowing his lawn”</p><p>(e) and (f) are different propositions.</p><p>What happened yesterday is relevant to the truth of (f), but not (e).</p><p>What happens today is relevant to the truth of (e), but not (f).</p><p>Propositions are temporally indexed.</p><p>Each assertion of a tensed sentence is a different proposition.</p><p>Propositions are immutable, abstract entities.</p><p>The truth of tensed propositions relies upon what obtains from the perspective in time to which they are indexed.</p><p>That index doesn’t change, and what obtains at that index can’t change.</p><p>Therefore, the truth values of tensed propositions can’t change.</p><p>All propositions are timeless.</p><p>Since propositions, tensed or otherwise, are immutable, then they are timeless.</p><p>Probably assumes a reductionist view of time</p><p>A timeless God would know truth value of all timeless propositions.</p><p>How can God know “what time it is?” in order to know the truth value of tensed propositions?</p><p>There is no fact to be known, McCann says.</p><p>We think of time as flowing past us, and “what part of history is it really?” is a bogus question, as is this picture of temporal transition.</p><p>The presence of John’s mowing his lawn is to be found in the event itself.</p><p>This “passage” of time, our experience of the world shows that we are “in the world”</p><p>We don’t simply have experience of changing, but also a changing experience.</p><p>God, however, doesn’t have a changing experience.</p><p>Becoming is a reality known to God, but it doesn’t mean He has a changing experience.</p><p>Temporal transition lies in the phenomenon of change itself</p><p>Being aware of tensed propositions doesn’t require “knowing it really happens” and experience temporal transition or having a changing experience.</p><p>God knows all there is to know about time from each temporal perspective.</p><p>A temporal being would lack access to (f) in the way I do, since I only have one temporal perspective.</p><p>A temporal being would only have one perspective.</p><p>This is a limitation on God which McCann can’t accept. He wants to maximize God’s persectives.</p></div>
