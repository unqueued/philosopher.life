TUE 12:54 PM
Now playing a little guitar. What are you up to today?
TUE 12:54 PM
Had to look Bubble Gut up.
TUE 12:54 PM
I'm sorry, that sucks. =(
TUE 12:55 PM
Just got done making the roast, magic and lecture with kids, now reading and writing before work
TUE 12:55 PM
I dunno what the web says. Just a short term stomach virus. Managed to make it all day yesterday but bad diarrhea. Had to stop on my drive home. Bad. Came home. Immediately pooped again and went to bed. Got up. A couple. Of times. My alarms went off. But that stuff took all my energy. And I didn't wanna drive 1.5hra north to discover I was not any better.
TUE 12:57 PM
Thankful for flexibility in schedule
TUE 12:58 PM
yes, that is a blessing
TUE 12:58 PM
I hope it goes away fast for ya. I know the flu has been spreading here.
TUE 12:58 PM
I think I'm good now. Still afraid to eat. I've had some crackers and a few potatoe chips.
TUE 12:59 PM
Cool.
TUE 12:59 PM
That is a start.
TUE 12:59 PM
Been replenishimg with gator aide. You know the drill. As I get old my stomach is getting more easily upset. Pleasures of getting old I suppose.
TUE 1:00 PM
Don't let. Me. Keep you from your day. You said you had work? Are you working somewhere now? Or at home work?
TUE 1:01 PM
My stomach gets more upset too. My brain hurts more often. Yeah, getting old isn't so pleasant.
TUE 1:02 PM
I recently had a conversation about this.
TUE 1:02 PM
sec
TUE 1:02 PM
Work: https://philosopher.life/#Afterschool%20Teaching
TUE 1:02 PM
Treat your students as your own children behind mountains of red tape enforced by bureaucratic enemies of their minds.
TUE 1:06 PM
Aye.
TUE 1:06 PM
Love that
 Lol
TUE 1:06 PM
Unfortunate realality. I bed you are an amazing teacher.
TUE 1:07 PM
I really want to teach aviation maintenance. I don't know that I will ever get the oppertunity .
TUE 1:07 PM
I am trying to figure out how to be useful to them right now in their context. Hopefully, I will do some good for them.
TUE 1:07 PM
What will you need to teach it?
TUE 1:07 PM
A job opening.
TUE 1:08 PM
I lack a piece of paper that says I'm qualified to teach.
TUE 1:08 PM
Ah, well, that will be the important part.
TUE 1:08 PM
Also, to the &quot;getting old sucks&quot; conversation I had yesterday: https://philosopher.life/#2019.01.07%20-%20AA%3A%20Climbing%20Partners
TUE 1:09 PM
My newest idea in how to work for myself. But also have health care was to become a substitute teacher, and begin raising training small live stock animals for a mobile. Petting zoo and little horse rides and what not.
TUE 1:09 PM
Working for yourself sounds like a godsend.
TUE 1:10 PM
With good advertisement and quality animals I think. There is money to. Be made in this old. But untapped market.
TUE 1:10 PM
Current plan is to. Pay off all current debt then re evaluate  where we are.
TUE 1:12 PM
I hope to survive until my children are adults.
TUE 1:12 PM
Yeah, that was kind of the idea. Being home. More with my kiddo.
TUE 1:14 PM
I'm gone too much, and even when I'm home in between shifts I'm tired and stressed.
TUE 1:14 PM
I'm a semester short of a bachelors in mathematics which is a high need area for schools. They use to waive the teaching certification in ky if you were in a high need area.
TUE 1:16 PM
Teaching a usable vocation is more appealing though. Despite first glance. There is alot of moral lessons that can be taught in aviation maintenance. It is not a job that allows for mistakes, shortcuts, or poor quality work.
TUE 1:17 PM
Most of the teachers I know are overworked and underpayed. Not sure it will save  you a ton of time.
TUE 1:18 PM
I can appreciate the vocation training quite a bit.
TUE 1:19 PM
I suggest those moral lessons exist in mathematics too. =)
TUE 1:19 PM
You'd have more time in the vocational training, imho.
TUE 1:19 PM
I cannot fathom morality in algebra.
TUE 1:19 PM
Moral lessons come in a wide variety.
TUE 1:21 PM
This isn't an easy one to see.
TUE 1:21 PM

My childhood
