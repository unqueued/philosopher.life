<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My brother called me back. We talked on the phone for a good bit. I love hearing his voice. We talked about a lot of things. He read the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="kickscondor.html">kickscondor</a> letters in full (I didn't realize he'd read it all, which is cool). He pointed to a shift in the tone of the writing. He said we were jerking each other off at first and then got to the meat'n'potatoes. He thinks I've been tested in the last section of the last letter. I think he's right. I'm lucky to have his perspective.</p><p>I talked fuzzily about my usual theory of mind problems. He's ever patient with me.</p><p>My brother walked me through his friends and why he only really enjoys meeting them once a year. He provides an important lens to friendship and socialization for me. He's such a unique human, it's difficult to find real friends for him. I'm not of much use to him, I'm afraid. </p><p>We talked about porn and masturbation. I think his meds have been affecting him, in a good way here. He feels better about it, and that's a good thing.</p><p>Cat sounds like it's kind of being tortured in love. </p><p>Poop in vacuum. Neat. </p><p>I forgot to say something to my brother (I'm ever forgetful). I've noticed in our conversations that he has sent me into my thoughts many times during the conversations. I apologize for being silent. I am thinking about what we are talking about! I'm kind of a klutz here. He sends me down rabbitholes mid-conversation, and that is offputting. </p><p>We discussed child discipline. November is coming fast.</p><p>I was touched that we got to speak for so long. I wish I could give him a hug.
