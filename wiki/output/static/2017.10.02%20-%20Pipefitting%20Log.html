<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My sync fucked up an I lost everything before the break. That's okay because I have a much bigger issue to write about today than what I did on the job itself.</p><p>In the morning, Vic, the general foreman of the riggers, was fired. He was fired because he told Chester, &quot;you are going to kill someone&quot; with how dangerous Chester had been doing the rigging work. Chester has already fired several people for contradicting him. He fired Vic on the spot. I shook Vic's hand and said I really appreciated working him. He said the same.</p><p>Two hours later, Chester fired some fire watches out of the blue. </p><p>After lunch, John and I were escorted to the van. With us was Bill the safety guy, James from the tool room, and Christina from HR. We were all going to be drug tested. </p><p>I was fired for refusing to take a random drug test. The other contestants were people who would obviously pass. I believe they thought I would pass as well. Oops.</p><p>This sucks, no doubt. My firing is 24 days earlier than I expected since that was when the job would end. </p><p>I went to the van anyways to see how it would play out. Maybe there was an option I didn't see. You don't fold in magic until you absolutely know you've lost. I did the same. I realized I didn't want this on my record, and I read the form carefully. It wasn't even worth taking a test I know I'd fail. John didn't believe me when I said I wasn't going to take out loud. He continued to joke. It wasn't until I shook his hand and told him I was really glad to have been able to work with him that he believed me.</p><p>We talked after his test. He said there is a 30-90 cool off period before Yates would hire me back. He told me that I'd probably be hired for the January job (if I even want it; I've been trying to find other options anyway). He told me I already was a real pipefitter with my hands, and with the math in my back pocket, I should just take the journeyman test. He said I'd do fine and to not let this get me down. </p><p>I filled out the necessary paperwork. James escorted me around to get my tools and clean up. I talked to Chris-M. I told Chris-M how much I appreciated working with him. He said he was glad to work with me, and that I was going to do fine. He handed me his business card. He told me that after his stroke, his memory is really bad. He said he might fail to remember me but to call him anyways. He also said that many of his friends keep piss bags with them (multiple people recommended this to me) with the heating elements. I will probably do that. That's how I'm going to pass piss tests from now on.</p><p>I talked to Colleen. She hugged me. She already knew before everyone else; I saw it in her face as we drove in. She is very well connected. She said she would see me in January and to make sure to call April (HR rep) to get the job again. </p><p>I talked to Oliver as well. He seemed very shocked. He wished me well, and I said the same.</p><p>I'm glad I still have the basic network contacts I need saved. I'm sad that I don't have any picture or video of all the hard work I've done on the job. I wish I could have shown my brother. He would have been very proud of it. </p><p>While I'm not happy about it, I'm definitely at peace with it. I'm very glad to have had the run I did. I've learned so much. I'm in a much better position than I was. We can make it. I'm ready to fight for it.</p><p>So, here's what I have to say to your world: </p><p><code>/middle-finger</code></p><p>I'm going to take what's mine anyways. Watch me.</p></div>
