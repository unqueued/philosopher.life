<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Daughter:</p><p>Mountain, port, waste, vial, matron, leader, crafter. She drops mountain. I drop vial and confidently announce I've won. She craters, lol. I drop port. Port her on upkeep, she doesn't crater my vial, she wastes my port, swings, kills vial. I drop caverns (I got timewalked). She chiefs, swing. I matron-&gt;inc. She drops her fourth mountain, plays SS, shoots matron, she matrons-&gt;whirler (I might lose here, lol), swings chief and matron. I inc-&gt;SS, shot in the face, drop waste, pass. I'm backpeddling the entire game. I know I've lost here. She trashes, matron-&gt;driver, GG. I've not gotten my asshole stomped in so hard in a while.</p><p>Daughter:</p><p>I mull into: 2 mountain, vial, lackey, kiki, krenko. Um, ok! Mountain, lackey. She mirrors. I swing, block, vial. She doesn't drop land, but mirrors vial. Ramp and pass. She mirrors. I ramp, mountain. She discards crafter (BOOYA! BIATCH ;P...THAT&quot;S WHAT YOU GET 4 CURBSTOMPING ME). I drop waste, trash, vial-&gt;INC!, trash(inc)-&gt;vial (WOOT!). She discards leader. I chief, krenko, GG.</p><p>Daughter:</p><p>3 mountain, inc, SS, matron, chief. Ugh, keep. Again, I'm begging to get wrecked by lackey. She caverns passes. I mountain. She mountains, crater. I take the risk of wasting cavern. She mountains, swing. I mountain. She drops port, doesn't swing, EoT-&gt;inc it anyways. She ports me upkeep (I ask which mountain), I drop port. Upkeep port her port. She says &quot;you know what I think of you?&quot; and wastes my port, ROFL. I mountain (so many in my hand), chief, swing. I'm poking and trolling to tilt her; she says &quot;sir, you worry me&quot; and drops leader-&gt;(inc, crafter, 2x lackey), HMB, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JHBFC.html">JHBFC</a>, discards sting (no swing). I inc-&gt;leader, chief, swing. She incs-&gt;chief, she drops 2 lackeys. I drop SS, light 'em up, instigator, swing-&gt;matron-&gt;trash. I straight up tell her how I think she has a chance of beating me, she indeed incs-&gt;trash, matron-&gt;whirler. I lackey, chief, swing, crafter, ping, GG.</p><p>-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-</p><p>She's taking notes in VIM and apologizes for it? (That's what I asked her to do). We have a discussion of editing her wiki from VIM. I'm trying to convince her to go Spacemacs or VIM and not to be a complete fool like me.</p><p>My daughter and I talked for an hour in philosophy and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="MTG.html">MTG</a> theory. There are some things I can only say through this language.</p><p>Son:</p><p>Mountain, cavern, port, lackey, instigator, inc, leader. He goes mountain, vial. I mountain, lackey. He incs. I cavern, dual vial. He matron-&gt;SS. I vial again, instigator. He's taking forever to type, but I'm cool with it (I need him to take notes...I hope one day he will believe me at start taking his typing speed seriously). He drops a second waste, incs-&gt;instigator, vial-chief, SS, no swing. I inc-&gt;SS, drop land, pass. He hardcasts krenko, vial-&gt;matron, I vial-&gt;sting-&gt;krenko (he doesn't activate). I ramp and pay echo, draw matron. He krenkos, chieftain, activate, doesn't swing, EoT-&gt;vial-&gt;matron-&gt;vial-&gt;SS, no shots from him! I go 4/3/3 on vials, vial-&gt;leader-&gt;(matron), vial-&gt;matron-&gt;whirler, vial-&gt;whirler, SS-&gt;chieftain, SS his board minus krenko, I drop chieftain, swing for 16. He leaders-&gt;(inc), inc-&gt;chieftain, I double SS his leader, concede. I should never have won that game.</p><p>Son:</p><p>Cavern, port, waste, mountain, vial, SS, skirk. I drops mountain. I drop mountain, topped lackey. He goes &quot;ugh.&quot; He incs. I waste his cavern, vial. He drops lackey, cavern. I drop port. Upkeep, I port him, he drop port, swings, vial-&gt;skirk, block. I drop mountain. He drops chief, doesn't swing. I vial-&gt;matron-&gt;kiki, inc-&gt;chief. Upkeep, port his port, matron-&gt;CHIEF. I hardcast kiki, pass (sitting on vial). He drops trash, trash(matron)-&gt;vial and in response I kiki-&gt;matron-&gt;chief-&gt;vial-&gt;chief, he wastes port. I kiki-&gt;matron-&gt;inc, inc-&gt;trash, swing for 4, lackey-&gt;leader-&gt;(whiff). He incs-&gt;kiki, inc-&gt;lackey. I matron-&gt;driver, driver, SS, swing for lethal.</p></div>
