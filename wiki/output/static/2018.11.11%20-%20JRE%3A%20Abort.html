1 HR AGO</code></pre><p>My brother tried calling my daughter, but it didn't work. I think it's awesome that he called her. He called me on the way to see my granddonor (actually, to see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AA.html">AA</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="L.html">L</a>, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="K.html">K</a>).</p><p>He's feeling as sexy as ever. Now that Raylan is gone, Rebecca is paying more attention to him. There are different ways to interpret that; I lean toward a positive interpretation of it. My brother knows best; he has all the information. Whether he gets to be with her for 10 weeks, 10 months, or 10 years, I hope he makes the most of it.</p><p>We talked about teachers and foster parents being treated like shit by a section of society. We were tracing out the origins and thought process behind it. I'm disgusted by that evil.</p><p>We talked about abortion, how we've switched. I favor taking human lives in many cases. I am no longer a pacifist, and I don't believe in the sanctity of human life. Personhoood, in its degrees, is the measure. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a> begins to exist in our inferential reasoning at around 16months. Our problem, of course, is that anyone would ever be put in a position that they feel it necessary to abort. The solution, as usual, is decentralizing power appropriately.</p><p>My brother joked about handing the phone off to the granddonor and me hanging up. He neared the restaurant and I decided to pull a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> and loudly proclaimed that I loved him and that I had to go. He laughed, and I giggled. My brother is very much inside my head.</p></div>
