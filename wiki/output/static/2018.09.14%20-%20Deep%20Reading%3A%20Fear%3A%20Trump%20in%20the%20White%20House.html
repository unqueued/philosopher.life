<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Alright, so Trump has been outspoken (for often poor reasons) against wars we're engaged in. Nobody can justify it to him. What are we missing here? </p><p>It's obvious that they &quot;can't win&quot; and are passing the hot potato of liability...I think I'm missing something awful.</p><p>I do not understand the firing of Bannon. I know I'm supposed to, but I don't.</p><p>Trumpisms are killing me.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly obvious that the whirlwind will never be reduced into a manageable point of view. There's simply too many moving parts for any person to provide a clean history of this. The semblance will always be weak.</p><p>&quot;I like these big round numbers&quot; - You know, this is the kind of bullshit I would parody with Bush. I need to stop participating in this. It's time to admit the sheer competence of evil humans. They have a competitive advantage in being immoral, and they are clearly wielding it.</p><p>Trump's xenophobia doesn't seem to enable any kind of allies unless they directly benefit him, stroke his ego, etc. This is always the initial hypothesis. Am I searching in vain here?</p><p>He asks the &quot;what do we get from...&quot; or &quot;what do get out of...&quot; questions with simplicity.</p><p>I hate that I'm not allowed to give up. I just want to give up.</p><p>Shithole is such an egregious word. You know, I don't completely disagree though. This is my problem. Sometimes Trump say something true. His intentions are fucking disgusting. But, yeah...we raped the world. They suffer in &quot;shitholes&quot; because WE did that to them, because we exploit them (look, I'm not saying we are the only people at fault either). It's such a weird feeling to agree with Trump on anything. </p><p>What do they mean by &quot;globalist?&quot; Seems like they could mean a couple things.</p><p>It's interesting how they don't seem nearly scared enough of Mueller. </p><p>&quot;You're a fucking liar&quot; lol. This felt like I was reading a play.</p><p>I feel icked out.</p></div>
