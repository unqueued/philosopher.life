<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>He called me today, but I couldn't pickup immediately. Called him back a couple minutes later. We had a good conversation. </p><p>Talked about Sphygmus' CSS a bit, ALM and AA as well. Of course, said I was reading and writing. Mentioned setting up remote with AIR and L. </p><p>He's been furloughed today, and the politics of it sounds unfun. He's been extra worried about money these past few months, far more than I've heard from him in a long time. Yet, he is sending is sending the children an insanely large gift (it will knock their socks off). I feel extra grateful that he would make such a gift under uncertainty. It is a humbling experience to be gifted something that I cannot pay back, yet again.</p><p>We talked about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="AIR.html">AIR</a> not responding. Sounds like he is partying or something? I don't know. He's definitely not spending his Mondays connecting with us like he claimed he would.</p><p>My brother told me a hilarious story that SHOULD go on his timeline. Raylan has a cut on his chin from falling on the keyboard (after repeated attempts to get the child not to be dangerous about what he was doing), and the boy said something wildly inappropriate about getting his butthole touched (wiping one's butt is like that, ofc) that had me in laughing. I walked little paths inside Aldi as my brother told me his stories. I wish I had stories to tell him, but my brain just doesn't work like that.</p><p>He had sex for the first time in a while, but felt bad afterwards. I talked about how a percentage of men feel unhappy, guilty, or sad after coitus. He thinks this isn't exactly him. He felt he was using his SO and failed to described in advance that sex was just for pleasure (he has been thinking about the topic), but when he talked with her about it, she didn't feel like he did anything wrong at all. In the end, he pleasured her, and I think we can legitimately say she wanted to have sex. I don't know what sex means (and I know it's extra complicated for him), but it feels good. He made her happy. She said it was a very pleasant surprise. My brothers meds are working. I told him I was envious; his meds actually work. I can see it. I'm really happy for him! I hope he will heal.</p><p>I didn't really ask him about his timeline, but I will keep buggin' him. As always, I'm a broken record.</p><p>Oh, he recommended shows to me. Sharp Objects and Castle Rock.</p><pre><code>Sharp objects 10/10, castle rock 7/10

 He built a new tool for versioning all of my daily snapshots to fit into 700mb instead of 6000mb; appears designed for hosting on dat (decentralized web protocol, basically).</code></pre></div>
