<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">I feel most energized when‚Ä¶</h2><p>I'm not entirely sure what is meant by energized here. I think it has to be more than being awake and aware in a strong way. </p><p>Can I be energized for something I don't want to do or don't enjoy? I would get an adrenaline rush during a dangerous moment, and that is definitely energizing in a sense. I despise danger and adrenaline rushes though, yet I &quot;feel&quot; energized in a strong sense.</p><p>Alternatively, I can be &quot;pumped&quot; to do something, extremely excited to engage in some activity. Is it simply about being excited? Is it just that which I desperately love to do and want to do? </p><p>What is the duration of this energy? Orgasms are fairly energizing. Drugs can be energizing. Are you asking me what gets me off?</p><p>What about spoons (as my wife calls them)? That is, people and socializing are draining to me, except for very particular conversations which completely hold my attention, fascinate me, make me want more, etc.</p><p>Note, what takes me out of my drained state into The Calm or above for &quot;energy&quot; (whatever that means) may energize me to a greater degree than that which only takes me from The Calm to a state above (even if this is a higher state than the former). So, are we talking about the total proportion of energy gained or simply that which maximizes the state of energy (which is conditional upon having been fairly energized in the first place)?</p><p>I'd like to also point out that I have minor manic/depressive tendencies. Energized isn't always a good thing, especially when it means I can't sleep or focus on what really matters.</p><p>Lastly, is this something which I can regularly achieve, or does it include a scope of contexts which are often rare (perhaps even 1-time events)? </p><p>Surely you can see that I do not know what is meant by this question, thus I must define it by inspecting its purpose.</p><p>I think this is about understanding how to control my moods, how to inspire myself, how to see the blessings in my life, and how to make myself feel happier. It is about being energized in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth. But, then, I fear we have no content. </p></div>
