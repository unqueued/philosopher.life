<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Two convos over the past 24 hours. Some connection problems; reached out with Ricochet (it doesn't play nice with offline messaging). Gave him the link to my site. I was so happy to see anyone using this software, and he seemed to want to have people contact him with it. I said, &quot;hi.&quot; We chatted briefly about it. His dad uses Ricochet, I explained that mine would never touch it (although, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="MWF.html">MWF</a> will likely hand you some variant of the obligation to humbly submit to authority because the Pauline God ordained it, etc...oh yeah, and cops tend to be good people too, rofl). </p><p>He sent me links to nomasters and <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://superkuh.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://superkuh.com/</a>. Cool! Uh, maybe I should have given him links? I don't know. It's not clear me what links of mine he would find most valuable. I'm actually not sure why he gave me those links either, lol.</p><p>He's poked around. Seemed spooked twice possibly, lol. I told him he might not like me from going through his HN profile. He asked me why. He already seemed to guess it would be political disagreement and seemed fine with it. Cool, good! I'm switching to keybase because while I have a special place in my heart for Ricochet, it's barely usable.</p><p>We talked about utility. He said he read one of my articles where I mention utility (everyone seems to think this is a blog, but that's just not how I see it), and he discussed thinking about lifetime utility calculations through integrals. I explained that I've never taken calculus, and he explained. I appreciate that. I like that he wants to do the math (and there are contexts where that is correct). I have a bunch of practical, heuristic worries. I voiced them, but he had nothing to say. Not sure if he thought they were pointless or not. Well, you got me. The dude is obviously intelligent and focused on a particular set of problems when I look through his profiles. Hopefully we'll connect more.</p></div>
