<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I was the second person interviewed. The other guy must have actually scored higher on the test. We talked a while before our interview. He was obviously an intelligent man who had studied for the exam (we had also talked before the last interview/exam). </p><p>I brought water with me to the interview. Shook hands confidently with the committee. They didn't ask any questions I wasn't prepared for; I was obviously very overprepared, but I'm glad I was. They seemed to like my answers quite a bit, although there was a worry that I was looking for something more local. Apparently, even they travel quite a bit, although the apprentices still stay in the area. My examples/stories demonstrated I had worked in the field and knew what I was doing. </p><p>They did eventually ask about my past (I'm glad I didn't bring a resume with me). I gave them the skinny that showed I was educated, but not stuck up about it. They felt like I had traveled quite a bit. </p><p>They asked if I had questions, and I came prepared. They didn't say anything terribly new other than that JATC and IBEW are partnered, and I think they see themselves more as the JATC side of things. They are obviously proud of their training. </p><p>I need to call the trainer up again tomorrow and make sure to set an appointment to be shown around, meet other students, etc.</p><p>They don't make decisions about apprentices until July. The marks they gave me in the interview, combined, is what ranks me on their list of candidates to choose from. They take from 10 to 25 apprentices each year, on average, they said. The list is currently 30-40 long right now. I think I did well in my interview, so I think there is a non-trivial chance I will be offered a position. Until then, they said, they might call me up to do indentured work which eventually counts towards my apprenticeship training.</p></div>
