<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>I appreciate that you were trying to make it simple for me. I still want to confirm that I don't want to wrestle with you. Because the word wrestle for me is very strong. It's make me think about fighting. I do not want to fight with you I just want to talk with you. I'm not better than you or mr. Stanley is not better than you either. I don't call you an atheist because what I remembered the last time when we talk you told me that you still love God. I did not say that you should change.when I said you will be great like the person who talked. I meant that you can teach many people like he is doing. I respect what you believe. If I misunderstood then I am sorry. I do think you are a great person. I am glad to hear that you still want to talk about Biblical. (Wait please I am still reading)
Wed 7:53 PM
 I think it is a great idea to make sense of  your/mine faith. Yes I did switched from Buddhism to Christianity. After I moved to the US for eight years. I have learned that there are many Buddhism that doing greater than Christians. It doesn't mean that I want to go back to be a Buddish. I want to persuade the truth of the Bible. ( I have to take a break, I will write more)
Wed 8:12 PM
 About the video when it's shown the Bible song at first from a child to an adult it just reminded me when I was a child and when I grew up as a Buddhist. I did have the moment like that when I grew up I did not want to find out about the truth and I thought that there were many monks that do the wrong things. That was one of the reasons that I changed religion in year 2000. The first five years I did not understand anything my life mixed up that was because I didn't listen. Another five years I did try harder to listen but still did many things wrong. I wish I could fix it. Now I'm not perfect but I just feel the love more from Him. I think that's the best part of being a Christian for me.( My head hurts I will write more)
Wed 9:31 PM
 I am not trying to preach you at all. The reasons that I sent the video the first one is that about growing up in a religion not just Christians but others too. The second thing is about Mark chapter 1 and 2 when the Bible talk about Jesus born. I do have a hard time to understand and believe this. Also this video makes me want to learn more about the history of the Bible.

 Andy Stanley it's not the one that I listen very often but Mr Charles Stanley is the one that I listen and learn from him a lot. There were many reasons that I listen to him and one of them is because he had has a long period of life time with God. And he still serving God. Another person that I try to learn from him is Billy Graham. I want to know the secret what made him had a very strong faith because even when he could not move but just lying in bed and he could pray for another person.

 These people are only the example that I want to learn from them. When I work as a CNA at a facility there's a young man that he could not even feed himself. that's make me think that I want to be an old person who have a lot of faith but not a young one who cannot do anything this is one of the reasons that I want to pursue the truth of the Bible.</code></pre></div>
