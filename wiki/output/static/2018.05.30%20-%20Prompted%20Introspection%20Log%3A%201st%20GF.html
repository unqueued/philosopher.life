<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">How did you meet your first boyfriend or girlfriend?</h2><p>I remind you that I'm an autist who didn't know he was. I think many others knew it, but nobody took the time to talk about it with me in any constructive way. Even my own exploiters attempted to hide it from others and myself in crucial ways, and they certainly didn't take the time to understand it scientifically (KYS).</p><p>Tiffany Cox, a popular girl in my class in 6th grade (I'd known her since 2nd grade). We sat on the bus together on a field trip, held hands, played a &quot;suck'n'blow&quot; card game designed to get us to kiss. We had no real relationship at all. She was vapid. I did a have a crush on Amanda Phillips, a shy female (who later said she disliked me because I was always right, but was pleased to dance with me?).</p><p>In 8th grade, Arlene Combs, the smartest girl in school was also my official girlfriend. I brought her roses in art class because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do. We didn't have a relationship though; it was again just this odd social display game. </p><p>I had plenty of female friends, but none romantically (or that I knew of, at least not on purpose). I only found out that females we were interested in me when someone told me. I suppose my kindness, empathy, and attempts to connect with them were taken as signs of flirtation. I do have an intensity about me that can be appealing at times (although, in the end, I think most people find it draining).</p><p>I can recall a co-worker (I'd know the name if it were said to me, but I can't pick it out...it feels like I'm having that name problem again when talking about characters on shows I've literally watched inside and out a dozen times), a kind cashier at McDonald's who asked me out to the movies. I picked her up. We watched a scary movie, and she held my hand. I didn't realize what was happening. I thought this person was scared and needed a hand to hold. So, I gladly held her hand. I didn't want her to feel scared or at least not be alone in it. It didn't occur to me until weeks later that she took us to be on a date. Ultimately, we never clicked. </p><p>There were several girls in college that I clicked well enough with, particularly the sarcastic and existential variety. I asked one woman, April (shit, I don't remember her name either, yikes) out on a date. She was an interesting woman, and quite intelligent.</p><p>A month after my date with April, my wife asked me out on a date. Two months later, I was married. =) It is true, the smartest females hold my attention. Also, I love boobs.</p></div>
