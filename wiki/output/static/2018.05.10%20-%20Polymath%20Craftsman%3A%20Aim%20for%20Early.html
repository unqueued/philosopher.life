<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>This is the second or third test of COlton. The goal is to fiinish these five lights and clean up so that we can leave early. I'm not sure that we can conince him to do so.</p><p>We immediately dove into our work. There is a solid 250 feet on line we are running to three lamps in daisy chain. As usual, since I take the initiative,  I get to shape the job. This is only Colton's 4th job as a foreman, and I can tell. He has only been a jman for 2 years. His ability to plan our job out is not excellent, although, I'm sure I would do worse at the moment by miles. </p><p>We were told they won't be driving a pipe for us and that our two junction box &quot;use the old wire&quot; plan is what we'll be using.  Colton does not seem to be in a rush, and he really should be aiming for the junction 
boxes if he were.</p><p>Also, he failed to secure the gravel we needed from Monday. Bryce is trying to find some that way we won't be here all day without cause.</p><p>We got a slight rain earlier in the day and a heavy one again later. I got soaked, so did the hay and dirt from the trenches. Hail also. </p><p>My chilluns packed me a partial lunch. I'm grateful.</p><p>Colton bragged that the gravel cost will be offset by a week less of labor (i.e., us getting paid less). That did not make me happy.</p><p>We ended up working in the rain, racing to get it done. We even skipped our break. We got out at 4:40, which our boss thought was &quot;on time.&quot; Yet, we gave up our break and worked when we normally wouldn't've. He claimed to have been letting us go early. That is not true, and/or it fails to appreciate the context.</p><p>Colton is:</p><ol><li>A poor planner</li><li>Exploitative of those beneath him</li><li>A liar</li></ol></div>
