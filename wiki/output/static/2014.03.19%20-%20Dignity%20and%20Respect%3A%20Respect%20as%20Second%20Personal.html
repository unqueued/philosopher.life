<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I must confess that parts of this paper remain fuzzy to me. I hope once I‚Äôve pierced through the veil, something obvious will present itself. The second-person language was not crystal clear. Today I only have a loose set of thoughts:</p><p>I happen to like how clearly Darwall links the concepts of Dignity and Respect, similar to how Hohfeld so clearly demonstrates a correspondence between Duty and Right.</p><p>I worry Darwall may be too quick to collapse the distinction between the capacity to demand respect (or remind someone of their obligations) and the right or real authority to do so.</p><p>I worry Darwall may be pulling dignity and respect apart from morality in a way that isn‚Äôt convincing.</p><p>He seems to claim that ‚Äúto be a person just is to have the competence and standing to address demands as persons to other persons, and to be addressed by them, within a community of mutually accountable equals.‚Äù Is it simply that others must perceive me that way, or is there an objective criterion? Am I not a person if other persons don‚Äôt address me as a person?</p><p>I won‚Äôt accept that personhood is the sole standard of competence, unless we mean something broader than what Darwall is implying. I do have an intuition that personhood is a driving force behind our dignity, and a reason to be respected. It seems to be a sufficient cause of dignity, but is it a necessary cause of dignity? I don‚Äôt know. I hope not. I have an opposing intuition, where I cannot accept that unborn, babies, very young children, very old people, or mentally impaired (whether temporarily or permanently), which do not count as persons, philosophically-speaking, do not have dignity requiring my respect. I am not sure why they deserve my respect, but I believe I owe it to them until I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they don‚Äôt deserve it. I do not trust myself (or anyone else for that matter) to draw this line, and so I must be conservative, extending ‚Äúrights of personhood‚Äù to those who may not actually merit them (in a game of limited epistemic resources, it is better to let the guilty be found innocent than the other way around). This is an application of the ‚Äúhedge-rule‚Äù in Judeo-Christian ethics and theology (one need not be a religious practitioner to see its validity), and something about it is quite right. I fear Darwall comes dangerously close to treading on this intuition.</p><p>I fear Darwall may be misusing the word ‚Äúmerit‚Äù in 126. It seems that dignity must be merited. It is appraisal respect that comes before recognition respect. We must evaluate an object as having certain good qualities before we can claim they merit recognition respect. Why does RR not require an appraisal of someone‚Äôs merits as a person?</p><p>The state-regarding vs. attitude/conduct distinction made in Respect vs. Care is unclear. I think if he fleshes them out, he may be forced to concede, in many cases, they amount to the same thing, or perhaps, ultimately, care may be a subset of respect, I don‚Äôt know. In some cases, I‚Äôm inclined to think respect is third-personal, although I do see some force behind his second personal concerns in the example of the middle-age daughter with broccoli. Paternalism is damaging in a sense, right? That is a care issue, perhaps.</p><hr><p>Dignity = standing/status with the right/ability/authority to demand or remind another person of their obligations to us (individually? Or to everyone?).</p><p>What does it mean to say ‚Äúrespect for this second-personal standing is itself second-personal?</p><p>Darwall thinks respect is treatment based, but he may fail to have the ‚Äúregard‚Äù just right. Maybe4 that is the ‚Äúauthority‚Äù part. We will see.</p><p>Respect is the fitting response to dignity. He links these two conceptually in his footnotes. Respecting just is to see an object as having dignity.</p><p>RR can be mandated and not merely warranted by its object. Mandated by whom or what? The moral law? The other person? How authoritative is this mandate? Note the difference between demanding respect and deserving respect.</p><p>What enables us to make this demand? Ambiguous. Difference between a capacity and a right or real authority. Mere capacity vs. Justificaiton.</p><p>‚ÄúThe dignity of persons, I contend, is the second-personal authority of an equal: the standing to make claims and demands of one another as equal free and rational agents, including as a member of a community of mutually accountable equals.‚Äù (121)</p><p>Is he claiming that the dignity of persons is second-person is not due to morality on 121? Is he pulling apart morality from dignity and respect?</p><p>Darwall accepts a contractualist framework.</p><p>I don‚Äôt understand what he means when he says, ‚Äúsince the authority that persons have as such is fundamentally second-personal, respect for it must be second-personal; it must involved acknowledgement.‚Äù (123)</p><p>I regret to say, I don‚Äôt think I understand what is happening in this paper. I‚Äôm sure once I‚Äôve pierced through the veil, something clear and obvious will present itself. I hope he isn‚Äôt using flashy-keywords which don‚Äôt have a real content behind them.</p><p>The only way to respect a second-person authority is second-personally.</p><p>What are second-personal reasons (rooted int eh dignity of persons)? 126</p><p>What does it mean, ‚Äúto be a person just is to have the competence and standing to address demands as persons to other persons, and to be addressed by them, within a community of mutually accountable equals.‚Äù Is it simply that others must perceive me that way, or is there an objective criterion? Am I not a person if other persons don‚Äôt address me as a person?</p><p>I won‚Äôt accept that personhood is the sole standard of competence, unless we mean something broader than what Darwall is implying.

It is appraisal respect that comes before recognition respect. We must evaluate an object as having certain good qualities before we can claim they merit recognition respect. Why does RR not require an appraisal of someone‚Äôs merits as a person? He goes all mystical in talking about ‚Äúvaluing someone intrinsically‚Äù I think.</p><p>The state-regarding vs. attitude/conduct distinction made in Respect vs. Care is unclear. I think if he fleshes them out, he may be forced to concede, in many cases, they amount to the same thing, or perhaps, ultimately, care may be a subset of respect, I don‚Äôt know.</p><p>Why would respect tells us not to exert undue pressure to induce her to change? It may boil down to a kind of harm as well. We might just be weighing harms, and it still may boil down to a kind of care, essentially.</p><p>How are ‚Äúreasons of care‚Äù third-personal and agent-neutral?</p><p>Paternalism is damaging. It isn‚Äôt what we would wish. We wish it didn‚Äôt have to exist. It would be way better if we didn‚Äôt have to engage in it. Sometimes, however, paternalism is correct. Sometimes respecting someone means not taking their values, beliefs, or desires as having as much as weight as they might normally. Sometimes respects requires to bypass those things. Some people don‚Äôt always have that authority in them.</p><p>I‚Äôm far more inclined to think respect is third-personal given his illustrations, although I do see some force behind his second personal concerns in the example of the middle-age daughter with broccoli.</p><p>Regarding someone as having a kind of authority.
