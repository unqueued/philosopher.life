<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>With Bob's multi-tab superpower, I have stopped going full-screen. This feels like a huge change to me. Normally, I have this distraction-free environment that is hyper-{<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Focus.html">Focus</a>}ed. I lose ~12% of the top portion of my screen, and it's noisy up there. </p><p>Currently, the &quot;Wiki&quot; workspace from top to bottom:</p><ol><li>i3 status bar</li><li>i3 tabbed windows bar</li><li>FF tabs</li><li>FF omnibar, buttons, addons</li><li>FF bookmark bar</li><li>Le Wiki</li></ol><p>I'm pretty sure I need to download enough malware toolbars to bring that tree of toolbars down to at least halfway down on my screen. =) </p><p>I need to think about whether or not this is interrupting my flowstate too much. I really fucking hate the F11 fullscreen because it does that jump thing. Autists don't like surprises! I'm so lazy:</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1201225" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1201225</a></p><p>What I prefer about the F11 action is that I can rotate between tabs without having to constantly turn full screen on. Once <strike>saved</strike> full-screened, always <strike>saved</strike> full-screened. Alright, maybe I'll make this modification.</p><hr><p>I am annoyed by that lack of solid search and replace features in TW. This is fucking insane. I cannot manage my text in an easy programmatic manner. For example, I want to tag those <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Prompted%2520Introspection.html">Prompted Introspection</a>s containing:</p><p><code>!! Respond to the following:</code></p><p>with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Antipleonasm%2520Analysis.html">Antipleonasm Analysis</a>. </p><p>I would much rather this tooling exist in the Wiki. I can do this somewhat easier in singlefile mode. I suppose the halfway measure here is xonshically answering this problem. We will get to that tooling. The ability to continue programmatically shaping this document with ease is something I must cultivate again and again.</p><p><strong>Sphygmus has come to the rescue!</strong> ‚Äì <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Search%2520Text%2520or%2520Title%2520Tagger.html">Search Text or Title Tagger</a></p><hr><p>It's not resilio sync! The race-condition/reversion just happened again. Ugh, the only options left are either the minutely script (I do not understand why that would be a problem) or Bob itself. I need to test (maybe rsync and then node build from the rsynced directory; I could also try and just time it by hand...if I come to Jed with this claim, I need to make sure I'm correct). Otherwise, this is a problem with Bob itself. I really need the race conditions to go away desperately. I need to test this, ugh. =( This a gamebreaking problem still.</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Remodeling.html">The Remodeling</a> has hit the origins of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Audit.html">Wiki Audit</a>. It's a wild fucking ride! Again and again I have not understood what I am doing. I cannot give up, of course. Even when I stand in awe of this absurdly ambitious project, sometimes I become metaphorically dizzy. I believe most people would think what I'm doing here is insane. I &lt;3 you too, folks. =)</p><p>In a weird way, this <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="remodeling.html">remodeling</a> has become a sort of harvest to me. I put in so much fucking work into this wiki, and I'm now piecing it together into a more coherent whole. It's like I pushed out a bunch of brix (need le TP for muh bunghole), I've done the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a>ish thing that picked through them for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="diamonds.html">diamonds</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="redpills.html">redpills</a> (including emergences), and built more beautiful structure out of it. It is moving to see the fruit of my labor; this really is my life. I'm reapin' it.</p><hr><p>More Tiddlytool shaping. I still have dots to connect. I'm pleased to be bruteforce traversing my wiki. I would miss many of these things. <strong>I had another fuckup. Please write it down!</strong></p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Wiki%2520Audit%2520Log.html">Wiki Audit Log</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Polymath%2520Craftsman%2520Log.html">Polymath Craftsman Log</a></li></ul><hr><p>My <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Log%2520Audit.html">Log Audit</a>s are partially inaccurate now that I'm tagging older material. It seems like these audits will need to be modified to include the others. Firmcoding and footnotes should get me there, I think.</p><hr><p>It's odd that I've not had anything I felt should be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Audit%253A%2520Purged.html">Wiki Audit: Purged</a>. Am I not being consistent here?</p><hr><p>I had a massive crash. I lost ~250 tiddlers worth in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Recent.html">Recent</a>. I had the savetrail, thankfully. Bob, clearly, was fucking up for quite a while too; none of the singlefiles were even close. I couldn't import them all at once in FF, but it works in Chromium (haven't had a reversion yet either). And, as I inevitably find after using FF for a while, Chromium comes back to being the most performant browser. I've set it to be my browser for editing the wiki, but I'm keeping my identities on FF.</p><p>Something else is wrong though. Check orphans, there are a ton <code>/home/h0p3/syncs/bob/Wikis/tiddlers</code> which went fucking crazy (IIRC, I attempted to tag these when it crashed). Welp, I set aside a copy of the daily backup of the tids. This would be a fine thing to programmatically solve. It turns out that I have the 0 byte .tids sitting in last modified. Maybe this will be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="1uxb0x.html">1uxb0x</a>'s first real assignment in python or bash? I don't know.</p><p>This is a lossy enterprise, and I'm grateful to have the backups. I'm plumb skeered to use TiddlerTools now though, and I don't see a replacement. That will make <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Remodeling.html">The Remodeling</a> considerably worse.</p></div>
