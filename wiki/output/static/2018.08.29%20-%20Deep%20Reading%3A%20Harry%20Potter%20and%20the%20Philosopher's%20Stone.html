<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>It has been a long time since I've gone through this series. I must admit, the movies influenced my perceptions of the books. This is uncommon for me, but I tend to be pleased about having that content. This was an important series to my youth. </p><p>I had my daughter read it at ~5 and my son at ~7. It didn't come alive for them intensely, but they trudged through it. I'm glad they did. I love how these giant tomes are artificially enlarged. You can read the first book in a couple hours; the size is a wonderful trick into helping children feel like they've accomplished something large. </p><p>Rowling does a good job of getting us to dislike characters. You really do want to beat some of these characters to death. Admittedly, this feels like a cartoon, almost Alice's Adventures in Wonderland territory (and I don't mean fantasy in general here) with its whimsy. So much of the world is illogical. This was a book that eventually helped me see that good fiction is about changing contingent truths in the world in a coherent fashion. Dumb as it may sound, it has been an important part of throwing off my dogmatic yokes and becoming a philosopher. It's not a quest for power except over myself, my perceptions, and how I approach the world.</p><p>Is it a waste of my time to read through my childhood books again? Maybe. Let's see. </p><p>Sometimes, I relate strongly to Hagrid. I'm a bear, outcast, emotional, good at what I do, but I'm not sophisticated. I want to like Hagrid though.</p><p>Children's literature leads our empathy so black and white-ly. </p><p>I'd be mildly interested to see Marxist interpretations of this work. Having grown up poor, I relate to several characters immediately. The deus ex machinas of wealth annoy me though.</p><p>The marks and symbols beat us over the head. This was somehow emotionally obvious to me, but not cognitively as a child. It's not like Narnia's allegory in it. These books demonstrated my ineptitude so clearly to me. I still don't have what it takes, lol.</p><p>You know, seeing the Dursley's again helps me realize just how gaslit and fucked over by own my donors I've been. Don't get me wrong, the Dursley's are considerably oversimplified dark triads, especially since they are just flat out less intelligent and wildly less knowledgeable compared to my far more competent donors. The groundwork of what counts as a bad parent was partially laid here for me. I think that's part of why I was so emotionally involved in this story. It also has the &quot;Ender's Game&quot; effect.</p><p>Quirrell's speech impediment annoys me. I wish it was normalized instead of applied to the evil-bearer.</p><p>One thing I must admit is how well-balanced this book series was. I really loved all the books. My favorite scenes are distributed throughout the series. I'm curious to see how many times I cry on this readthrough.</p><p>The sorting hat is really an odd character. It appears to be far more powerful than we might initially think. The house/categories have always annoyed me. I don't think Rowling and I would see eye-to-eye on ethics in the end. But, I've pointed out where she's a bitch elsewhere.</p><p>I think my children, being homeschooled, can't fully appreciate the social clique jockeying bullshit (i.e. human nature) enough to recognize everything in the story. In the end, I don't want them to see that as normal, even though I have to teach them how to effectively navigate the dark-triadic cesspool (to varying <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, obv) that is 97% of humanity.</p><p>The various tribes, including between the adults and children at large, always stands out to me. So many of these problems would be resolved if a professor were given the right information at the right time.</p><p>Admittedly, I only felt like Harry Potter in terms of my poverty and being different. I think HP is actually anti-intellectual in the end. I think courage notion is a complete failure on Rowling's part to understanding unity of virtue. /shrug. I always felt more like Granger, but I'm too weird to be that anymore. Maybe I'm Luna? I don't know. This is hard to pick out. Snape is my favorite character; he's devastating.</p><p>I need to swish and flick my dick. Leviosa!</p></div>
