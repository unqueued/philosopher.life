<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I'm against IP rights as they are generally understood. However, I think that IP rights are really a right to information, intellectual objects, ideas, and how they relate to physical objects in the world in an incredibly generalized way (metaphysics to physics). It is here that I start to see IP rights as existing. I think personal information (PII) belongs to the person, at least in a legal sense. </p><p>We must minimize personal data collection and distribution while maximizing its protection. We must defeat the data maximization norm, and reverse it. It is not our fault when large and powerful entities take and lose our data; we aren't responsible for the consequences, although we are bafflingly held accountable as individuals. It's ass-backwards. We must hold corporate entities liable for using our personal information. If they collect it, then they are responsible for maintaining and protecting it. This should be their risk, not ours. We must penalize them, as that is the only way to do anything about it.</p><p>Corporations that lose personal information should be generally penalized (and scale with the size of the corporation to enable competition, and scale with the data breach size for fairness as well), but they also need to pay for individuals losses. The burden of proof should not be on the average joe either. The world needs a wake-up call, and I'm fine with radical changes in our digital world for this. What practices can we mandate? I'm not sure. Surely there are some low-hanging fruit best practices we ought to at least start with, but I don't want to that to be the low bar we expect. </p><p>Of course, data breaches will always be covered up. We may generate incentives to be as ignorant as possible. We must come down even harder on this feigned ignorance. We need a way to punish gross negligence and conveniently malicious ignorance even harder. Further, we must empower whistleblowers. People should constantly be looking to whistleblow to the public. We must incentivize individual honesty in order to break down the illegal and immoral trustbonds found in corporations that benefit from hiding it. We need whitehat hackers to be the skilled whistleblowers of our world. We should protect them at all costs. They must be able to report security vulnerabilities with impunity, just as we would for physical objects in the world. They are the only people with technical knowledge necessary to point out the problem before blackhats smash and grab. </p><p>Corporations must be maximally transparent about what personal information they are collecting, how they are using it, and who they exchange it with. We cannot be in the dark about how they use this. We must consent to it, and when we have no choice, we must be able to influence policy around these corporations.</p><p>We aren't going to be able to hold China and Russia accountable, but we sure as fuck can protect ourselves. We need a reformation into a security mindset.</p><p>Additionally, banks are responsible for your identity theft as well. They must be on the hook, and let them punish other corporations.</p><p>Also, kill NDA's off. Legally enforced silence is unacceptable.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.20</sup></button></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2018.12.20 : </span> I am unironically <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Straussian.html">Straussian</a> in this claim.</sub></p></div>
