<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I was considering just making a welding log out of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Welding.html">Welding</a>. As I near the end of the primary aspects of the pipefitting course, I hope to fill out the edges and acquire other kinds of tools. I want to be excellent with the oxyacetylene torch (would love to make some art to get knees wet, nameplates, etc.), have some experience with less common pipefitter handtools, automated beveling (among other tricks), and build my toolbox (dogs, centerfinder, level+square combo). The shop has old bandsaw blades. I need one of those. The odd L-prism (like a super deep mini square) used for drawing lines on the pipe is also useful. Beyond that, I would really like to get some welding under my belt.</p><p>I spent all day in the welding shop today. I finished three 2G welds, a total of 21 passes. I spent a lot of time talking to people. Honestly, the welders seem to be a smarter group of people than the pipefitters on average (with obvious outliers). My first root was still the best. It is much easier with a teacher standing there talking to you as you do it. My other two roots weren't as good. Certain parts were between excellent and passable, and others were terrible. My major fuckup was the last one. I think it was because the bevel was bowed out. I really do need a very clean bevel. It's clear that I can't half-ass that part. </p><p>Grinding the root makes it much easier. I've been grinding everything but the caps. I just want it flat. There is a domino/pond ripple effect when you have mistakes early on. Grinding isn't the norm, and it isn't allowed on tests. Fake it till you make it. Dale said I could grind if I wanted. There's nothing technically wrong with it; it's just against the convention. </p><p>My second 2G I used 4 stringers for the cap instead of 3. That was a mistake. My third 2G I used 3, but the first two caps beads were just too far apart. This is just a matter of practice. Getting that distance right isn't going to happen overnight. </p><p>Dale and I talked about my strategy. He thinks I should go straight into welding after my pipefitting program. He said he would jump me ahead of the line in front of the 200-person queue to enter his class. In the meantime, I can come work in his shop whenever I want. He says he could help me finish plate in a month. He said it would take 8-10 months minimum to be able to do pipewelding. I clearly have a long way to go. He's not in love with the union idea, but he's not against it. He does agree it is the fastest way to become a journeyman pipefitter. He also thinks their welders are quite good. He has no direct complaints outside of being forced to travel. I think he is also deeply connected to the fabric of the local industries here, which are all very anti-union. I must take his perspective with a grain of salt. </p><p>He says he has never had a hard time finding a job. Welders do make good money. I think I should stick to pipefitting for now though. I think I'll enjoy the work more. He had good things to say about my teacher's pipefitting program, and he thought it was a shame they generally come out getting paid much less on average than his welding students. I think he saw the reason for the union but didn't want to admit it. My average pay in the union will be higher than his students.</p><p>I talked with one of the students. He is an odd one. He has been a welder for a long time but said he has a hard time getting jobs because he doesn't have a tech school on his resume. So, he's doing a short 4-month stint to knock the course out. We talked a lot about politics. He was a racist trying not to be racist. He didn't like the union either, but actually had significant socialist values (he had high praise for what unions &quot;used to be&quot; in his view; although, even his historical knowledge of it was lacking). I actually appreciated his point of view, warts and all. </p><p>I had several students help me today. While there is a lot more individual work in these classes compared to pipefitting, I liked the camaraderie. It is definitely a different atmosphere.</p></div>
