I put too much thought into this, but I'm glad I did. I need the fucking practice.</p><p>I am overqualified for this position, but I knew that. It pays $10 an hour. I'd make enough to help us keep our head above water, but not anything more.</p><p>I have near free reign to program here, which is what I want. Guess who is going to be taking all the chillun to the 'puter lab to get all up in the wiki, lern 'bout dem internets (thank the good lord), and listen to music/audiobooks? &lt;‚Äîthis guy. Guess who is going to make everyone freewrite, design, and introspect? Me. Wake up, chilluns!</p><p>My goal is to automate this job in a moral way and attend to the individuals as best I can. Snacks, playtime, and games part of it. 15-20 kids (better than the 30 I've had to handle before) with possibly one helper. I gotta say, even though this glorified babysitting position pays absolute shit, this job, at least at face value, is something I find morally valuable.</p><p>Clearly, I dazzled my interviewers with my credentials, questions, and responses. Both my interviewers told me multiple times they felt honored to have me interview for the position (man, they are going to be disappointed, lol). I'm glad they don't hate that I'm a misfit just yet (give them time!). They will be recommending me (clearly, they don't know any better). I think I'll find out next week if I got the job.</p><p>I am able to bring my own children, but they would be in another group. That's fine with me. Spending a few hours with other children and teachers could go a very long way. Socializing without the prison would be excellent. </p></div>
