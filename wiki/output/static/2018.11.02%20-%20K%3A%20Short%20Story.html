THU 11:04 AM
Are you referencing the abstract or do you have access to the PDF?
THU 11:10 AM
Either way it sounds like a good read. :)
THU 11:11 AM
Link is only to the abstract. I can ask [[k0sh3k]] for the paper for you if you want it.
THU 11:13 AM
Why do you like slasher movies?
THU 11:14 AM
Hmm. That’s an interesting question. If you had asked me ten years ago I would have said “Because they’re scary.” But in my old age I have to admit that they aren’t as scary as they used to be.
THU 11:16 AM
I don’t want to say that the killings are fun either because I don’t really like the gore equals horror modern horror spin.
THU 11:16 AM
Lore is fun and unique stories stand out to me.
THU 11:17 AM
The lore and uniqueness of slashers. I cannot say I've ever approached the genre that way.
THU 11:19 AM
been a long time since I went a slasher spree though
THU 11:20 AM
Well Freddy exists in the dream world because reasons. There’s heavy implication that when he died he became a demon. There’s implication for that with Myers too but there’s a dumb cult. Haha Scream embraces horror movie tropes in a satisfyingly Meta way which is parody of itself.
THU 11:48 AM
Aye
THU 11:49 AM
I wonder how much of that Lore is carried over in other pop culture references/allusions to these slashers.
THU 11:50 AM
I've seen some Asian slashers before (though, I can't recall any names). They have their own thing too.
THU 11:50 AM
If that kind of thing is interesting to you and you haven’t seen it then I highly recommend all four Scream movies.
THU 11:51 AM
I still really wanna watch Ju-On. I just never get around to it.
THU 11:51 AM
Been through a couple. It is not my thing, hehe.
THU 11:51 AM
There are Asian slashers?
THU 11:51 AM
Gotcha.
THU 11:51 AM
I'm actually not sure how to draw lines for what counts as a slasher.
THU 11:52 AM
Yeah? What are your criteria?
THU 11:52 AM
I have no idea, lol. Usually a mix of jumpscares, a person who slashes (but it seems a bit arbitrary that they must slash...like why not bludgeon?), some standard horror tropes (if you are having sex at the beginning, you are dead...don't split up, etc.)
THU 11:53 AM
But, I probably have a naive view.
THU 11:54 AM
or painting too broadly*
THU 11:54 AM
anyways, what you up to today?
THU 11:56 AM
Those are actually pretty strong beats! But we can save that discussion for when we come down. ;)
THU 11:57 AM
Working all day and having no time to do what needs to be done. The usual. Haha
THU 11:57 AM
You?
THU 11:57 AM
Homeschooling, applying to more jobs, and the monthly audit for my logs.
THU 11:57 AM
Any place you have your eyes on particularly?
THU 11:58 AM
I have places I'd love to work, but I'm not holding my breath for anything. I think there is a reasonable chance that I will get the job I interviewed for yesterday.
THU 11:59 AM
Congrats in advance!
THU 12:00 PM
Thinking I will move more towards desk work now since I want to make space to work on my wiki at work.
THU 12:00 PM
Yeah that makes a lot of sense. When [[L]] isn’t slammed with work she can do pretty much whatever she wants on the side.
THU 12:00 PM
Aye. Humana was awesome about that. Parties, fuck around on the computer, etc.
THU 12:01 PM
I used to go down to play magic with the security guards everyday.
THU 12:01 PM
Hahaha
THU 12:01 PM
That’s wonderful. :sweat_smile:
THU 12:01 PM
Can I email you a PDF of my story?
11 HR AGO
Yeah, ofc!
10 HR AGO
What email would be best?
10 HR AGO
any, these are the two I use most: h0p3@protonmail.com or LE EMAIL
10 HR AGO
Sent to your gmail!
10 HR AGO
I like the italics mixed in to hear the innervoice.
10 HR AGO
I'm done done with the story, so don't answer this yet if it gives anything away:
10 HR AGO
What is the etymology of Valacris? Neat word.
10 HR AGO
:innocent:
10 HR AGO
A horror short story about love.
9 HR AGO
Never have or intend to have sex in horror!
9 HR AGO
Hahaha. They were doomed from the start!
9 HR AGO
So regarding etymology.
9 HR AGO
You do an excellent job of putting us into his head space and then pulling us out for description.
9 HR AGO
I took the word volucris, which is Latin for “Winged Creature” and bastardized it. So that’s where the bird aspect comes in. I also found out during my editing that there is a demon in mythology called Valak. Pure coincidence but I may have snagged one or two little details from that to compliment my monster. The Latin word may apply more to bugs which is why I gave it huge eyes.
9 HR AGO
Thank you! I’m really bad at details so that’s a huge compliment for me. &lt;3
9 HR AGO
Shit. I just realized that you were probably inferring that from the beginning instead of the end...
9 HR AGO
My bad.
9 HR AGO
So, I clearly value writing enormously. I think it's THE high art. I'm not saying you should monetize this (I have no problem if you don't), but if you do go that direction, where would you be heading?
9 HR AGO
You shopping for publishers?
9 HR AGO
(We've had this discussion before, but I've never actually read anything you've written before)
9 HR AGO
if you go the self-published route, what does that look like?
9 HR AGO
Will you go for an anthology?
9 HR AGO
You can tell I know little about horror, so I'm not sure what the market looks like at all.
9 HR AGO
Truthfully I’m going to send this to some literary journals. There’s one I have my eye on that pays authors so I’m definitely sending it there. If nobody wants to publish it I’ll post it for free and hang on to it for the future.
9 HR AGO
One day I’ll have enough to put together an anthology. ;)
9 HR AGO
What did you think of the story?
9 HR AGO
I'm not sure what I think about it yet.
9 HR AGO
Reminds me of formalized greentext.
9 HR AGO
I feel like I understand the characters but I'm not emotionally attached enough to them.
9 HR AGO
But,  this is a short story problem for me as a reader, I think.
9 HR AGO
I think I am not your audience at all though. I don't like being scared (I actively avoid horror most of the time), and I'm a pleb when it comes to fiction. I ignore storylines or try to read between them every time. I'm after the non-fiction somehow (but, this also misses the point). I will have [[k0sh3k]] read it as well. She has the emotional intelligence and verbal reasoning that I do not.
9 HR AGO
Short stories for me are borderline poetry because they are so sparse.
9 HR AGO
I think there is almost a parable quality to yours. Perhaps it's in the Poe direction.
9 HR AGO
That’s one of the harder parts of writing short stories. Getting the audience to care about characters in such a short span of pages is very difficult.
9 HR AGO
