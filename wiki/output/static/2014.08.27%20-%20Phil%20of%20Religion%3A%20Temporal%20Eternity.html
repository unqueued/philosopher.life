<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>3</p><p>How many of you think God is timeless? Alright, good, we are done.</p><p>Before the reading, I‚Äôm going to say a little bit about the landscape surrounding the issue. We need to set the stage first. Afterward, we will follow the text closely to dig out the argument, and along the way offer criticisms or comments, and ask questions. At the end, we‚Äôll have a final interrogation of the argument.</p><p>Here‚Äôs the landscape:</p><p>Classical, Western, Judeo-Christian theism traditionally holds that God has several attributes:</p><p>Omnibenevolence (being perfectly good),</p><p>Timelessness (being outside the flow of time)</p><p>Immutability (changelessness)</p><p>Omnipotence (being all-powerful)</p><p>Omniscience (being all-knowing)</p><p>Each of these attributes are highly debated in philosophy of religion. There are philosophical puzzles and arguments which explore the coherence of these attributes, both individually and corporately. Many of these attributes are interrelated.</p><p>Classically, theists believe God‚Äôs has no beginning or end, His life is eternal, and that he transcends space and time. This transcendence can be phrased in different ways, such as the claim that God is ‚Äúoutside time.‚Äù Many questions arise from this belief:</p><p>Does God last forever by being wholly outside of time, or by having a temporal life that goes on forever?</p><p>Is God‚Äôs life wholly unmarked by temporal succession?</p><p>Or does the claim that God transcends time and space mean only that God exists outside of our physical spacetime, even if his own life still unfolds sequentially?</p><p>Essentially, does God enjoy (as Boethius claims) ‚Äúthe complete possession of illimitable life all at once,‚Äù or instead does God experience His life in sequences like us?</p><p>We will distinguish between atemporal eternity and temporal eternity.</p><p>The idea that God is timeless, experiencing an atemporal eternity, is very old. It can be traced through Parmenides, Plato, Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, and Aquinas. The Timelessness of God used to be the majority opinion of philosophers of religion. Today, it is the minority opinion (that doesn‚Äôt mean those epic philosophers were wrong).</p><p>In-Between Views:</p><p>Some philosophers think that God‚Äôs relation to time cannot be captured by either of the categories of temporality or timelessness. Rather, God is in some third kind of relation to time. One in-between position is that God is not within our time, but he is within his own time. In this view, God‚Äôs inner life is sequential and, therefore, temporal, but his relation to our temporal sequence is ‚Äúall at once.‚Äù In a sense, God has his own time line. He is not located at any point in our time line. On this view, God‚Äôs time does not map onto our time at all. His time is completely distinct from ours.</p><p>Another view is that God is ‚Äúomnitemporal.‚Äù It is true on this view as well that God is not in our time, but he experiences temporal succession in his being. Our time is constituted by physical time. God‚Äôs time (metaphysical time) has no intrinsic metric and is constituted purely by the divine life itself (Padgett 1992, 2001; DeWeese 2002, 2004). If God is omnitemporal, his metaphysical time does map in some way onto our physical time. So there is a literal sense in which God knows now that I am typing this sentence now.</p><p>Another view (Craig, 2001a, 2001b) is that God became temporal when time was created. God‚Äôs existence without creation is a timeless existence but once temporal reality comes into existence, God himself must change. If he changes, then he is, at least in some sense, temporal. Just as it is not quite accurate to talk about what happens before time comes into existence, we should not describe this view as one in which God used to be timeless, but he became temporal. This language would imply that there was a time when God was timeless and then, later, there is another time when he is temporal. On this view, there was not a time when he was timeless. God‚Äôs timelessness without creation is precisely due to the fact that time came into existence with creation.</p><p>Arguments for Divine Timelessness:</p><p>God‚Äôs Knowledge of the Future</p><p>It isn‚Äôt obvious how a temporal God can know the future, nor how He might know the resulting choices of being with free will. The problem, however, doesn‚Äôt seem to arise as clearly for a timeless God.</p><p>Maximality of God, the Fullness of God‚Äôs life</p><p>No being that experiences its life sequentially can have the fullest life possible.</p><p>God has the fullest, maximally best possible life, and that means he isn‚Äôt temporal.</p><p>Creation and Contingent Time</p><p>If time is contingent and God is not, then it is at least possible that God exist without time.</p><p>If time is contingent, then it depends upon God for its existence. Either God brought time into existence or he holds it in existence everlastingly.</p><p>Suppose time came into existence with the universe so that the universe has only a finite past. This means that physical time was created by God. It may be the case that metaphysical time is infinite or that God created ‚Äúpure duration‚Äù (metaphysical time) also. In the latter case, God had to be timeless. God created both physical and metaphysical time and God existed entirely without time. God, then, had to be timeless. Unless God became temporal at some point, God remains timeless.</p><p>Philosophy of space and time bears upon this discussion considerably. There may be other positions which the author neglects, and there may be different ways to interpret his argument given various philosophical stances on space and time.</p><p>It isn‚Äôt clear what it means for a being not to experience sequential time or to be outside of time. We might think of it, for example, in terms of dimensions.</p><p>It is very difficult for an entity which can only experience 1-D to comprehend what it means to experience 2-D. Similarly, it is difficult for an entity which experiences 2-D to comprehend what it means to experience 3-D. Same for 3-D to 4-D, and perhaps 4-D to 5-D.</p><p>Who wants to outline Davis‚Äô argument?</p><p>He argues against the atemporality or timelessness doctrine in stages:</p><p>Timeless God can‚Äôt be the Christian God.</p><p>Timeless God can‚Äôt be the creator, and Christian God is the creator.</p><p>Timeless God can‚Äôt be personal, and Christian God is personal.</p><p>Concept of a timeless being is incoherent.</p><p>Concept of timeless being ‚Äúper se‚Äù is incoherent</p><p>Concept of timeless and omniscient being is incoherent</p><p>When we look at the bare metal, a lot of the argument seems to center on whether we are warranted or justified in believing the doctrine, but not necessarily about the actual truth or falsity of the doctrine itself.</p></div>
