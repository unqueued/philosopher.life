<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>A while back, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a> suggested to me a speculative murmur that I can't quite shake. Her claim was that the RNC is going to impeach Trump. After reflection, I'm increasingly convinced this is a real possibility. Pence is a fairly standard Republican for this day and age, and obviously more in line with the RNC's policies and strategies. He's the leader the RNC really wants. So, I'm open to the possibility that Trump's presidency is an egg which will hatch Pence's presidency. Before Pence emerges, the RNC will extract as much political capital from Trump as they can.</p><p>The idea is that Trump, attention and media whore that he is (there is no such thing as bad press in his eyes, just as long as everyone thinks he's rich and powerful, that is good enough to him), will happily and perhaps unknowingly (in a sense) take credit for doing the RNC's dirty work (stuff they wanted implemented, but stuff they don't want to sacrifice their political capital on unless they must). I'm not sure all of what is on the dirty work list that Trump will be scapegoated for during impeachment (even if and when he doesn't actually have the power and influence to support and push these through), but I believe that &quot;dreamlist&quot; includes:</p><ul><li>The elimination of social safety nets, opportunity equalizers, medicare, SS,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> etc.</li><li>Deregulating markets at all levels, including the limiting, removal, or twisting of environmental and natural resource preservation, mobility and neutrality protections, conflict of interest and collusion prevention, and anti-competitive laws and policies.</li><li>Raising taxes on the poor and the remainder of the middle class while simultaneously giving enormous tax breaks, shelters, and higher financial mobility to the wealthy. </li><li>A marked assault on voter rights and continued gerrymandering.</li><li>Opening the gates for a striking expansion of the prison-industrial-complex, debtor's prisons, police militarization, the erosion of due process, etc.</li><li>Advancing US imperialism and nationalism (while isolating us in other respects) and continuing to feed our gargantuan military-industrial-complex</li><li>Dismantling some international &quot;legal&quot; obligations and many relationships (as rumored: to the benefit of Russia)</li><li>Injecting steroids into the surveillance+censorship-industrial-complex, codifying what Big Brother already does and perhaps forcing mandatory backdoors on us all.</li></ul><p>I don't know when the RNC would slip the Impeachment dagger in Trump's back, but I'm sure they would want to make use of their &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; as much as possible before disposing of him. Maybe Trump is going to politically hang himself, and the RNC will feed him the rope. Even if it never comes to fruition, it could simply be a form of leverage, a threat the majority-holding RNC hold over Trump's head.</p><p>Ultimately, while I think Trump is good at campaigning and getting screen time, I'm not yet convinced he has any clue what he is doing politically in some crucial respects (although, he is clearly very talented at what he does). While power and wealth will likely centralize strongly under his reign, I'm still convinced Trump is accepting being used as a political pawn in exchange for 'dat publicity and wealth-based virtue signaling.</p><p>If I am wrong, if Trump is more competent than I can discern, then we may have an even bigger problem. Trump's moral insanity is the stuff of fascist dictators. </p><p>I hope I am completely wrong. So far, his executive orders have not given me much hope. We are all holding our breaths and biding time.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Not that the Baby Boomers deserve my help. We're in a mess they have largely created with their psychopathic, egoistic destruction of all of our futures (I believe they have already thrown the human species off the cliff). Even if I ignore blame via maximum empathy, it is clear that they are in no small part causally (even though they aren't morally) responsible for the state of our world. Time will tell if my generation will be the saviors our species needs or just more of the same. I'm betting we will fail.</sub></p></div>
