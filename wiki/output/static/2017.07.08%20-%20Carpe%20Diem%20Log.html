<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><ul><li>Woke up on time, but went back to sleep next to my lovely wife. </li><li>I got up and started the kids on their schoolwork (to make up for a day they elected to miss [without permission] this week). </li><li>I tried talking with ALM. But, he didn't respond.</li><li>I spent time playing league.</li><li>I had a good philosophical conversation with my wife about an SMBC comic and virtue theory. It seems to me that the virtue theorist need not agree to the spirit of this brilliant cartoon. It's an important problem, I think. Non-cognitivism is a problem, as usual.<ul><li><center> <img src="./images/SMBC-Virtue-Problem.png" width="1300"> </center><ul><li>I should do a prompted introspection on it.</li></ul></li><li>It went well until I made her cry on a tangential topic. It was unexpected. =( </li></ul></li><li>Apparently, we are being charged a late fee for rent, even though it is usually automatically deducted. They didn't make the deduction and didn't say anything (we assumed it was a holiday issue), and then charged us. They made no attempt to correct a problem which was clearly on their end.<ul><li>We are appealing. I do not think we'll win. I truly despise renter-seekers.</li></ul></li><li>We hit the library, as we do every week Pinky. </li><li>We went shopping.<ul><li>Apparently, our Wal-mart card had $100 on it, and our Mastercard Giftcard had $25 on it. </li><li>We paid cash for the rest of the groceries.</li></ul></li><li>We made chili.</li><li>We did the meal prep for the week.</li><li>I talked to the kids about working hard at school, about how our relationship evolves, about empathizing and planning for their futures, and everything in between. It was quite detailed and sophisticated (I'm not doing it justice here, but I don't have to).</li><li>We ate, talked, and watched some league.</li><li>Showers for everyone.</li><li>My wife and I did the kitchen for the kiddos today. We made a big mess, etc. Better for us to just get it out of the way.<ul><li>Also, I like meal prep. I think we should consider it for general life too. There are many useful reasons.</li></ul></li><li>Inform the Men!</li><li>I got more packing done.</li><li>Also, I found out that running the washer on an extra spin cycle nearly dries out the clothes by itself. That's awesome!</li><li>Also, I don't know if I forgot to mention it, but my Coinbase account came back into my possession again. I made a good $50 investment early into the life of Eth, and it is paid off big time. Maybe I should consider doing more small investments in the infancies of cryptocurrencies that I value. </li></ul></div>
