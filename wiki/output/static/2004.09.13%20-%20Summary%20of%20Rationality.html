<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Rationality is a necessary component of persons in the original position. Reason, supposedly leads us to the two principles of justice. Rawls lists attributes of the rational person. Rational people prefer more social good than less. The rational person is “deprived of information about [his or her] particular ends, [he or she has] must have enough knowledge to rank the alternatives.” Rational people know that “in general they must protect their liberties, widen their opportunities, and enlarge their means for promoting their aims.” </p><p>A rational person has a “coherent set of preferences between the options open” to him or her. Ranking these “options according to how well they further [his or her] purposes;” he or she attempts to follow the plan that will satisfy “more of [his or her] desires rather than less.” Rational persons follow plans that have a greater chance of being “successfully executed.” 
Rational individuals do not suffer from envy. The principles are “derived on the supposition that envy does not exist.” Envy does not promote justice. Because envy is collectively disadvantageous, and does not conform to the veil of ignorance, envy cannot be found in the rational individual.</p><p>Rawls says, “the assumption of mutually disinterested rationality, then, comes to this: the persons in the original position try to acknowledge principles which advance their system of ends as far as possible.” They do this by striving for the “highest index” of social goods, since this would “promote their conception of the good.”</p><p>Those in the original position must be capable of a sense of justice. This capability is public knowledge, which insures the “integrity of the agreement” formed in the original position. These rational persons rely on each other to “act in accordance” with the principles decided in the original position—“their capacity for a sense of justice insures” that the principles will be followed. Rational people only enter agreements they know they can keep. Rawls explains, “Conceptions of justice are to be strictly complied with;” “guided by the theory of the good and the general facts of moral psychology, their deliberations are no longer guesswork;” “Rational individuals with certain ends and related to each other in certain ways are to choose,” “using deductive reasoning from their beliefs, interests, their situation, and the options open to them,” “among various courses of action in view of their knowledge of the circumstances.”</p></div>
