<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The answer is that sunk costs only have a seductive appeal to those who are attached to their subjective past. They do not like the thought that the person they were, two days ago, was possibly engaged in futile activity. They want to behave in ways that redeem their past days.
</p></blockquote><p>Is this wiki a giant sunk cost fallacy?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2019.03.23</sup></button> This is an important issue. I admit, there is a way in which I disconnect from my past because it is important to my future self. It is true, I have not been rational enough. Although, I will also point out that {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Vault.html">Vault</a>} is easily the weakest of my top level directories.</p><p>Again, Rao commands us to not making the newbie mistake of trying to explain it to others. That won't help.</p><p>Of course, as he points out, making sunk-cost indifferent decisions may have fallout costs with other people who don't make the same mental leap. That is a cost which must be weighed even in the slightly evil's ultimate analysis.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Revenge emerges when you add up two traits: an innate tendency towards vindictiveness and a capacity for long-range planning. Vindictiveness is simpler and much more fundamental. In tribal societies, it leads to vendetta dynamics. In civilized societies, it leads to revenge dynamics.
</p></blockquote><p>Revenge is never worthwhile. Vindictiveness is rational only insofar as it is not revenge. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Vindictiveness is a natural tendency to immediately and instinctively push back when pushed, as hard or harder than you were pushed...
</p></blockquote><p>Knowing how to be vindictive in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons isn't so easy. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If you suspend judgement and immediately start looking around to actually figure out what happened, you are assuming nothing. This is the apparently rational, data-driven way to proceed. In contexts where winning matters (honking matches on the road aren‚Äôt among them), it is also a way to lose.
</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, it appears to be a more guttural skill that must be habituated.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Vindictiveness is a status-leveling move. If somebody hurts you, it doesn‚Äôt matter what the reasons and backstory are. If you don‚Äôt hurt them back, you‚Äôve lost status points...If you don‚Äôt push back, your opponent has a story to tell where your inaction can be read as acceptance of guilt.
</p></blockquote><p>You have to not actually care about status except insofar as it is instrumentally valuable to achieving your outcomes. Only then does status matter, which, unfortunately, appears to mean that status means quite a bit in the ultimate instrumental (means to ends relationship) analysis. Tough for an autist like me.</p><p>The guttural things are all up in here.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Accepting blame without proof (i.e., needlessly admitting guilt) legitimizes the other person‚Äôs authority to act as judge, jury and executioner without proof.
</p></blockquote><p>You should push back always.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The tribal world is full of such ambiguous, adversarial skirmishes. Being very generous, always giving the other person the benefit of the doubt, handing over information advantages regarding the material truth of a matter without a fight, and turning the other cheek without regard to the character of the opponent ‚Äì all these civilized responses are recipes for getting killed very quickly. There is a reason prison cultures have the rule that you should beat up somebody on your first day.
</p></blockquote><p>Jesus, that is well said.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2019.03.23-1</sup></button></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2019.03.23 : </span> Nope!
