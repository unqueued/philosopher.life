The title made me laugh. I'm sorry it took forever.
WED 11:10 AM
Hey man. I just got off work. I actually read half of the letter on the way to work. LOL. I haven't finished it yet. Weekend was a little crazy and still trying to catch up.
WED 4:31 PM
Awesome response letter. Now I have to read all the linked wiki pages. And fucking footnotes? You're so awesome. Indeed it will take time for a response. Also, a large section of your questions are unanswerable. But you knew that when you asked. &quot;what is your purpose in life?&quot; we could write  a book of bullshit on that one. But really... Who knows the answer to that. It is both objective and subjective simultaneously. I  don't even know what I want for breakfast tomorrow. Haha.
WED 6:42 PM
Love the letter, and I am excited to research, read, learn, and respond.
WED 6:42 PM
I made a doorway into the rabbithole for you. Hopefully we are writing the best answer we can to that partially unanswerable question. Even if we can never be certain about the answer, I suggest we can get closer to it (and close enough in each of our contexts).
