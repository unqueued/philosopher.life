It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous‚Äîambiguous and fluid‚Äîbut also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern.
</p></blockquote><p>Dimensions or modalities, or both? </p><p>I take you to be talking about the postmodern project at large, and I think you are attempting to offer a metamodern interpretation of dealing with this problem. It's &quot;going with the flow&quot; of the rhizome. There is no outside-text, only frames of relativized reference inside some epistemic construct somehow linked to the external ontological structure around us (an assumption I'm going to take up, btw). My worry, of course, is that you have nothing but hyperreality here. You, of course, would accuse me of being confused about meaningness for some variant of denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. </p><p>I suggest that the very sentences you write, the ideas you are arguing for, cannot be at the same time meaningful and meaningless in the same respect. You have no choice but to assume an objective fact of the matter to even dream up denying it in the first place. Of course, I am not wholly allergic to postmodernism as I used to be. I am indebted to those philosophers who came before and paved the pathway to see that transcendental gateway. </p><p>Fixated pattern recognition and objective, external meaning seeking just is your existential plight.</p><p>Let me suggest that we likely agree to a great deal and that we simply have a disagreement for now about how to say it. </p><p>It is easier to deconstruct than construct. It's entropy. I worry that you might expect moral realists to offer an account that is convincing to every 'rational' person, or you will throw it away and say it is impossible. I see it as a matter of faith in the objective, of course. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Meaningness is a hypertext book (in progress), plus a ‚Äúmetablog‚Äù that comments on it. The book begins with an appetizer. Alternatively, you might like to look at its table of cont
</p></blockquote><p>I found your work fascinating quite a while ago. In fact, the structure you are working with has served one of my inspirations for what I'm doing here in my wiki. Thank you.</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Meaningness%253A%2520An%2520appetizer%253A%2520purpose.html">Meaningness: An appetizer: purpose</a>:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><ul><li>Is there any purpose at all in living? Or is everything completely pointless?</li><li>What am I supposed to do?</li><li>How can I choose among the many ways I could spend the rest of my life?</li><li>Does everyone‚Äôs life have the same purpose, or does everyone have their own?</li><li>Where does purpose come from? Does it have some ultimate source, or is it just a personal invention?</li></ul></blockquote><p>Normativity and Metanormativity is at the heart of this existential work. This is the priceless jewel we seek, of course. And, what makes it priceless? Only itself, of course: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a>.</p><p>I am pleased to see that you will attempt to strip religions, philosophies, and whatever other possible normative systems exist (whatever that means) down to the bare bones. You are peeling back layers, seeking reality. Do you think you can have something objective to say about it? Are you going to attempt to demonstrate these as instances of hypothetical imperatives, and will you also try to relativize that?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness. Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies. The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism.
</p></blockquote><p>Hello, Heidegger and Hegel, my friends. </p><p>To the hard questions:</p><ul><li>Is meaningness an object external to our minds? Is it objectively real?</li><li>Do you believe we impose meaning onto the world, that the world is meaningless itself, that somehow our notions of meaningness supervene upon reality?</li><li>You describe the pairhood of the dialectic. I presume you are attempting to be a 3rd party sublator. Do you take yourself to be escaping the fundamental Dialectic of all conscious minds?</li></ul><p>That &quot;X is true&quot; or &quot;X is false&quot; is a meaningful dichotomy which I take to be external to my mind. I realize I can never bridge the transcendental divide, and I can never know the thing in itself. Perhaps it is simply faith. What other option is there?</p><p>I worry that you will spiral into the postmodern blackhole from which there is no return. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Everything has a fixed purpose, given by some sort of fundamental ordering principle of the universe. (This might be God, or Fate, or the Cosmic Plan, or something.) Humans too have a specific role to play in the proper order of the universe.
</p></blockquote><p>My opinion about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> is eternalist on your definition. Ah, but I deny the implication embedded in your last sentence here. I agree that the moral law particularizes to each of our contexts, but I believe you have strawmanned eternalism here by attempting to couch it as some preordination or grand scheme with only one proper ending. Perhaps I'm not being charitable enough, and we shall see in the rest of your work how this plays out. </p><p>For now, I suggest my interpretation of the Categorical Imperative is fairly flexible and defensible to many of the standard criticisms of &quot;eternalism.&quot; There are fundamental issues, of course, which I cannot resolve. However, I believe <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> can be computationally more rhizomatic than you have recognized (which surprises me, since you are an AI expert).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan. It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything.
</p></blockquote><p>Ah, this is better. Now, please explain how you know it is a false dichotomy? To what principles will you refer to and rely upon to demonstrate you are correct? You, of course, no doubt, have anticipated my concern. I am ready to see your answer. </p><p>Let me grant that the pursuit of truth requires a pendulum process, a dialectic, a continual oscillation to being less wrong and getting closer to the limits of the truth. This is a messy process. There is fluidity. It's heuristical. It's coherentist, rhizomatic, and contextualized. To grant nothing beneath it, however, is to assert pure simulacrum.</p><p>Here is what you must see: there is a difference between claiming epistemic limits and denying ontology itself. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Nothing has any purpose. Life is meaningless. Any purposes you imagine you have are illusions, errors, or lies.
</p></blockquote><p>You deny it. How rigidly do you deny it? Why are you allowed to deny? What justifies and explains your denial? If you cannot point to something meant to be eternal (even if you are wrong about it, again we only work our way towards it), then what do you have? Look, I'd love to have a middle ground. It would, &quot;like, totally&quot; solve my problem. When you strip layers away from the problem, as you dig closer to the surface, you see this problem redundently present itself as every corner. Why should I think we can escape it?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless. It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything.
</p></blockquote><p>I find this so odd. Look, do you believe your words have meaning? If you say yes in any possible sense, then you're kind of stuck. I don't see how you escape some eternalist notion. Why not just look at the eternal as being fluid in a sense (or fluid given our finite and fallible minds)? </p><p>Is meaningness explicitly contradictory (same time, same respect)? Again, I'm willing to bend over backards into an eternal vortex to explain how we climb a ladder out of the pit of chaos. I can show how the rungs we once stood on were actually illusions, meaningless, or at least not what we thought they were. This is part of the hermeneutic spiral. Do you mean to deny the ladder itself though? Here you must answer carefully.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This is the stance of nihilism. It appears quite logical. It might seem to follow naturally from some scientific facts: everything is made of subatomic particles; they certainly don‚Äôt have purposes; and you can‚Äôt get purpose by glomming together a bunch of purposeless bits...Nevertheless, the seemingly compelling logic of nihilism needs an answer. It turns out that it is quite wrong, as a matter again of science and logic. But because that is not obvious, three other stances try (and fail) to find a middle way between eternalism and nihilism.
</p></blockquote><p>Love the intro and denial of Shafer-Landau's notion of moral realism. Let me express my deepest skepticism towards science being capable of dispelling this. Their empirical investigations, of course, are important for casuistry, detailing the concept of minds, and understanding the nature of physical reality, but this is definitionally outside of science. I am surprised by your move. Logic is also a hard one to swallow. Kant appears to make a damned good point here too. There's something missing. Are you sure you've found it?</p><p>You seem to think you've escaped the dichotomy, but I am also shocked that you think there is any middle way to deny as well. I don't know what that means. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The supposed cosmic purposes are doubtful at best, but obviously, people do have goals. There are human purposes no one can seriously doubt: survival, health, sex, romance, fame, power, enjoyable experiences, children, beautiful things. Realistically, those are what everyone pursues anyway. You might as well drop the hypocritical pretense of ‚Äúhigher‚Äù purposes and go for what you really want.
</p></blockquote><p>Is that really a middle way? I fear you've deeply misunderstood metaethics if you think there aren't full-blown eternalist accounts of normative desire-satisfaction, egoism, consequentialism, and even libertarian notions that do this work. Moreover, they are dead serious about these being &quot;eternalist.&quot; I grow increasingly worried that you aren't in a position to speak with authority on the notion of eternalism itself. </p><p>Why do you think this a &quot;middle way.&quot; It seems like you haven't shown how this perspective isn't eternalist at all.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>‚ÄúMaterialism‚Äù has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful. It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist.
</p></blockquote><p>I've always considered them to have an important connection to each other actually. I see a nihilistic deconstruction of the world that allows people to reconstruct by choosing from a relativized buffet of normative concepts designed to satisfy their desires. That deconstruction, I think, is in no small part due to the metaphysical notion of materialism. Post-modernism aims to destroy metaphysics, and by practicing it dutifully, it destroys itself. Attempts to rebuild are artificial fabrications to my eyes, but of course, it's a terribly convenient egoistic form of eternalism to assent to.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>However, at times everyone does recognize the value of altruistic and creative purposes, which this stance rejects. 
</p></blockquote><p>Slow down. Ethical egoism appear to at least try to explain altruism and aesthetics moreso than you imply. In fact, it appears that even <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> can be reinterpreted to do exactly the work which you claim it can't do. Why should I accept your overly narrow definition of normative materialism?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Moreover, most recognize that materialism is an endless treadmill: the enjoyment of new goodies wears off quickly, and then you are left craving the next, better thing.
</p></blockquote><p>Oh, boy. I have something awful to tell you: it's not just materialist desires, it's desire satisfaction of any kind (see: Schopenhauer). Whether or not we are running on this treadmill also doesn't make it meangingless by definition (although, this is a crucial question!). Furthermore, this is also not incompatible with eternalist stances. You are just flat wrong in your conceptual analysis.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You can‚Äôt take it with you. After you are dead, it is meaningless how many toys you had. What matters is how you live your life: whether you create something of beauty or value for others. You have unique capabilities to improve the world, and it‚Äôs your responsibility to find and act on your personal gift. 
</p></blockquote><p>Ah, this sounds exceptionally eternalist to me. Why do you think this is a middle ground? The &quot;ought&quot; here is still eternalist.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This is the stance of mission. The problem is that no one actually has a ‚Äúunique personal gift.‚Äù God does not have plans for us. People waste a lot of time and effort trying to find ‚Äútheir purpose in life,‚Äù and are miserable when they fail. Besides that, rejecting material purposes causes you to overlook genuine opportunities for enjoyment and satisfaction.
</p></blockquote><p>We might disagree on uniqueness. Also, it doesn't matter if there is a God or not, this could still be true. You also now imply the categorical value of &quot;genuine opportunities for enjoyment and satisfaction.&quot; You provide no justification for this. Worse, I am convinced you have contradicted yourself.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>‚ÄúMission‚Äù is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful.
</p></blockquote><p>As opposed to others' meanings? This seems to be the eternalist stance, obviously. Are you purposely begging the question to strawman?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Since the universe (or God) does not supply us with purposes, they are human creations. Mostly people mindlessly adopt purposes that are handed to them by society. You need to throw those off, and choose your own purposes, as an act of creative will...This is the stance of existentialism...Actually, it is more-or-less what existentialists called ‚Äúauthenticity.‚Äù Using that term would be confusing, because existentialist ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù hasn‚Äôt got all that much to do with the everyday sense of the word....It is based on the assumption that if purposes are not objective, or externally given, they must be subjective, or internally created. Existentialism holds out hope for freedom. But it is not actually possible to create your own purposes. Choosing at random would be pointless, and impossible; and what purely personal basis could you have for choosing one purpose over another?
</p></blockquote><p>Astute. You've been down this path. I suggest that coherentists in the analytic tradition take themselves to be engaging in an eternalist existential stance. I think you've got a more continental point of view here. You clearly see that this devolves into nihilism.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Each of these confused stances treats meaning as fixed by an external force, or denies meaning or some aspect of it.</p><p>The central message of this book is that meaning is real (and cannot be denied), but is fluid (so it cannot be fixed). It is neither objective (given by God) nor subjective (chosen by individuals).</p><p>The book offers resolutions to problems of meaning that avoid denial, fixation, and the impossibility of total self-determination. These resolutions are non-obvious, and sometimes unattractive; but they are workable in ways the alternatives are not.
</p></blockquote><p>What makes it something that can't be denied? If it's not us, then it must be external to us, right? Perhaps it is the right relationship between the external and internal, but that is still an externality. </p><p>I would be &quot;eternally&quot; grateful to your explaining what it means to say &quot;meaning is real.&quot; Also, I want to point out how &quot;it cannot be denied&quot; is vividly separate from the claim that &quot;it is real.&quot;</p><p>I am worried that you deceive us with your claims of fluidity. Are you absolutely sure you don't mean that it's not a fixed kind of fluidity?</p><p>I am extremely worried about your strawman of objectivity. Obviously it doesn't have to be God-given. </p><p>Alright, looking back, in charity, I must say you raise excellent points. You do a good job of showing us the primary stances. We clearly disagree on the nature of the dichotomy/spectrum and where these stances really sit and their conceptual limits of sitting on this dichotomy/spectrum. I have also only looked at what counts as your abstract here. It's an amazing abstract, even if I disagree with you on it. I'm ready to be shown I'm wrong. Let us see if you escape my critique.</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Meaningness%253A%2520Preview%253A%2520eternalism%2520and%2520nihilism.html">Meaningness: Preview: eternalism and nihilism</a></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Eternalism and nihilism are the simplest, and most extreme, stances toward meaningness.</p><ul><li>Eternalism says that everything has a definite, true meaning.</li><li>Nihilism says that nothing really means anything.</li></ul><p>Both these stances are wrong, factually. They are also unworkable, in their implications for living.
</p></blockquote><p>Strong words. You're bold. Sounds like you are selling something. =) This looks like an epic strawman. I do not wield the word &quot;fact&quot; lightly (it's a technical word for me). Unworkability, of course, is also not a defeating argument against either.</p><p>Here you go bro:</p><ul><li>Everything has a meaning.</li><li>Nothing has a meaning.</li><li>Some (but not all) things have a meaning.</li></ul><p>Logically, those are your only options. </p><p>They are all quite extreme and simple appearing. I worry, however, that just because these propositions appear simple that you want to shuffle away any approach to explaining and justifying them as being &quot;simple.&quot; Far from it. As I discussed in the last section, you clearly have not been careful in understanding how to talk about eternal meaning (which I consider the harder horn of the dichotomy to interpret).</p><p>I'd like, up front, your opinion on the meaning of logic. Tell me, do you think &quot;a=a&quot; is logically true in all possible worlds? Do you think it contains any normative content whatsoever? If you are going to make sweeping generalizations here, I need to first know I'm not dealing with someone who relativizes logic when it is convenient for them. I'm not going to engage in a fancy dance with you.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>However, almost everyone falls into them at times, triggered by particular contexts. Each stance is based on genuine insights, and a powerful, emotionally appealing pattern of thinking. They also can seem to be the only possible alternatives, so we are forced into one by the repulsive qualities of the other.
</p></blockquote><p>I want to know what you mean by &quot;genuine.&quot; You agree these insights have meaning. Tell me about how that meaning is meaningful. </p><p>I disagree on the repulsion as the sole motivating argumentative force. It seems that people clearly can be attracted to one and not merely fleeing the other.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Confused stances are resolved by dissolving their fixations and accepting what they deny. Specific ‚Äúantidotes‚Äù or counter-thoughts are available that help with this...Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness.
</p></blockquote><p>Poison-thoughts. You have my attention. Counterproofs and healing viruses to our malware are important. Obviously you are touching on our desire for confidence, if not outright certainty, in normative meaning. You want to release us of this burden. I get it. Soothing words, no doubt. But, do you actually solve the problem? I will require an explanation of the dimensionality of meaningness. You are telling me what it isn't, which is fine. Contrast is crucial. But, you also need to have an account for it (although, I don't expect perfection here, obviously).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Meaning is important enough that this uncertainty is emotionally unacceptable.
</p></blockquote><p>What an odd phrase. &quot;Important,&quot; of course, is just another word for meaningful, i.e. Meaning is meaningful enough. Note the difference between the two:</p><ol><li><em>X is </em>meaningful, and I find uncertainty in its meaning to be emotionally unacceptable.</li><li><em>Meaning as a concept which obtains in reality is </em>meaningful, and I find uncertainty in its meaning to be emotionally unacceptable.</li></ol><p>Being wrong about what is meaningful is entirely different from being wrong about there being meaning at all. I find that many people have made the mistake of conflating the two above. Are you sure you are talking about the latter?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness. It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity. See also fixation, another defense.
</p></blockquote><p>Meaning is definitionally fixated. Meanings can come and go, perhaps, but that just means (I'm sorry, I don't have another word) the fixations come and go. It's part of the structure of a meaning to be fixated. It's a functional relationship between at least two objects. Meaning is computed. It has to have a deterministic element to it to be meaning at all. Why are you not talking about this? You are too skilled in your art not to know.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If meanings are objective, not human creations, it may seem they must come from some ultimate, transcendent source. In many systems, that is a God. In others, it is an abstraction, like Fate or Reason or the Absolute. These are supposed to provide the sole source of meaning, purpose, value, and ethics. I refer to any such source as an eternal ordering principle or Cosmic Plan.
</p></blockquote><p>Good. I'm glad you were specific.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Luckily, there is no eternal ordering principle, so eternalism is false as a fact-claim.
</p></blockquote><p>Luckily, the quote above is an eternal ordering principle of meaning, so eternalism is true as a fact-claim.</p><p>Oh, no, I like this one more:</p><p>Luckily, there is no eternal ordering principle which justifies the above quote, so eternalism is false as a fact-claim.</p><p>This is a terrible argument. I fear you are oversimplifying on purpose, like you are trying to hide the very problem itself under the rug. The problem of meaning is one of question begging par excellence. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Arguments about that never seem to persuade anyone, however. So I take this hyper-atheism for granted, and instead ask: what are our options if eternalism is wrong?
</p></blockquote><p>Umm...No, you don't get to just &quot;help yourself.&quot; You can request that we take up your assumptions for the sake of argument though. Let me charitably grant you that.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Here it is helpful to understand what works, and doesn‚Äôt work, about eternalism (and the other confused stances) emotionally, rather than in terms of truth.
</p></blockquote><p>You said the magic words. Appealing to my emotions, I think your eternal argument about eternalism is trash. You are presenting &quot;truthiness&quot; in your &quot;meaningness&quot; relativized just enough to conveniently capture what you want, but not accepting the consequences of it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The appeal of eternalism is that questions of life-purpose and ethics have clear, simple answers. If you act in accordance with this Cosmic Plan, you are guaranteed a good outcome. You can be assured that seeming chaos and senseless misery are all orderly parts of the will of an all-good principle.
</p></blockquote><p>The gloves are off. You clearly aren't even trying to give &quot;eternalism&quot; a fair shake. You appear to equate every concept of it with some prosperity theism gospel. That's absurd, even from a theist's perspective! Who the fuck said eternalism offers clear, simple answer? You have completely missed the point. You're trying to make it sound dumb and oversimplistic, and you need to be steelmanning the argument instead. </p><p>You need to define <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>. You don't get to just help yourself to it when you want it, buster. Right now, you are denying it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>In those situations, adopting the eternalist stance makes you think and act in ways that lead to big trouble.
</p></blockquote><p>See, you don't get to use the word &quot;trouble&quot; in a meaningful way unless you can define the normative content embedded in it. You have to have an exlanation, even if you only have a circular one (and then we infinigress, of course).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It is difficult to see how the suffering caused by earthquakes could be willed by a benevolent God, or meaningful, or anything other than disasters that just happened. The difficulty of maintaining willful blindness to meaninglessness is an obstacle to eternalism. It is hard not to fall into the confused stance that most things are God‚Äôs will, but not the bad bits. Once you admit that some things are meaningless, the logic of eternalism starts to fall apart.
</p></blockquote><p>Umm...Suffering is meaningful, even if only instrumentally. The Theodician's Jury is out on whether or not suffering is intrinsically meaningful (and you are in no position to deny them). Do you mean to say the opposite of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> is meaningless by definition? That cannot be correct.</p><p>To say something is incorrect, wrong, or bad puts boundaries on what that thing is. It explains, at the very least, what it is not. That is a negative meaning. Now, you might say we need positive meaning, but we must be open to the possibility that all positive meanings can be reinterpreted in terms of negative meaning agglomerations. Object X is simply not object Y, Z, A, B, etc. Perhaps we don't have to give it any more than that to pick it out of our domain. Of course, that isn't a predicate. But, we can go negative on that as well: Object X simply doesn't have the properties Q, W, E, R, T, etc. Real objects have properties, right? Negative meaning is a meaning.</p><p>Thus, suffering, since it is bad, since it is explicitly not <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, is meaningful. It means something to us in our narratives. In fact, I suggest that Dasein's plight is conceptually bound to experiencing some degrees or types of suffering. </p><p>To the extent the word &quot;suffering&quot; can be understood, it is meaningful. That's true by definition. Some of these stories are false, yes. We can be wrong, yes. Stories change, and the best understandings require jumping from one existential vortex to the next. You must pickup grand metanarratives and wield them until you find the next one. You can put one down without putting on another. There is no escaping this. That is Dasein's plight. Well, you are doomed to agree to one, even if you simply call that grand narrative &quot;meaningness.&quot; There is no escaping it. Is there a grand metanarrative of the metanarratives? I cannot compute an infinigress, thus if I am to escape infinitely computing it, I must answer, yes. It's a bufferoverflow error or some fatal existential computing error not to. Aren't we already going to assume it is incorrect to just be stuck in a thoughtloop trying to solve it for the rest of our finite lives? You can only solve the problems that are possible for you to solve. The only answer to the question, &quot;is there meaning?&quot; requires having begged the question that there is meaning in the first place. This is the only practical option. </p><p>Would you ask the question &quot;is there meaning?&quot; if you didn't want the answer? Note, of course, wanting the answer is already a kind of question begging here if you take that &quot;desire&quot; to really be you. What if the answer was impossible to achieve, or what if it took infinite computing power to answer it, or what if you must cross into NP-Hard problems or incompleteness to solve it, or what if you must cross the transcendental divide into metaphysics itself to have the answer? Do you agree &quot;ought implies can?&quot; If that is conceptually true (and it appears so), then you must agree that we cannot expect ourselves to come up with impossible answers. What then are the correct limits of possible answers? Maybe that varies per person, with each mind having its own limits. Fine. I'm willing to be fluid and contextualize hard fucking core, but there must be a principle for this, right? But, surely, you can see that the ultimate answer, since you agree there is an answer, must ultimately rest upon a foundation of external, objective meaning. You cannot escape the grandest of grand metanarratives of metanarraatives (second order): <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a>.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Truth.html">The Truth</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a>, is impractical to us by definiton.</p><p>I'm done reading for now. I clearly have more in common with Spinoza that I could ever admit. It's time to dig into him.</p><hr><p>I'm taking another try at it. It's clear that author intends to lambast the Judeo-Christian memeplex, and he does so correctly a large percentage of the time. He also clearly has no idea what I mean by Eternalism at all.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Nihilism starts from the intelligent recognition that eternalism is false and unworkable. Most events are meaningless; meaning is not objective; there is no Cosmic Plan.

I appreciate where he is coming from though.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Instead, nihilism uses intelligence against itself to produce stupidity. Somehow meaning must be explained away by intellectual sleight-of-hand.
</p></blockquote><p>I fear a man who gets eternalism wrong doesn't really get nihilism either. There is no stupidity on nihilism. It literally doesn't matter. Here's the author's problem, he just needs to call it: Contsruction and Deconstruction. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a construction which allows him to survive deconstruction.</p><p>I agree with a lot of what he's saying though. I appreciate he has taken the time to say it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It‚Äôs common for people to switch between eternalism and nihilism repeatedly in the space of a few minutes. Once you start to see this pattern, and catch yourself doing it, it becomes funny.
</p></blockquote><p>Fair to say. With the amount of trash talk and strawmanning you've levied, you better have a damned good answer. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The various ‚Äúconfused stances‚Äù discussed later in this book arise in this way.

Or, if meaning is not objective, it must be subjective. But these are not the only possibilities.
</p></blockquote><p>Teach me to compromise wisely, to go with the flow, master. I'm very interested to see your nomadic answer. I will be forever in your debt if you can show me The Way. I hate to warn you that even speaking of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> of moderation requires a standard. I believe you see this recurring problem, but will you be able to satisfactorily answer it?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>According to the stance that recognizes meaningness, meaning is real but not definite. It is neither objective nor subjective. It is neither given by an external force nor a human invention.
</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to say meaning is not definite? Meaning defines. It gives us the outlines of things, the essence of things, the properties and relationships of things, the order and structure of things, the value and purpose of things, etc. Do you even know what you are saying here? It's a contradiction. I will walk with you on your contradictory path because I'm curious. You obviously have insight, but you are speaking doubletalk here. </p><p>Pray tell what it means for something to be neither objective nor subjective? I have no idea what that even means. Similarly, you have vexxingly claimed to dissolve the externalist and internalist debate alongside the realist and anti-realist debate. You're claiming to have solved the fundamental problems of philosophy here. Forgive my doubt. You're a genius, no doubt, but I have excellent reason to suspect you are wrong.</p><p>I am continually annoyed by your inconsistency, hyprocrisy, helping yourself to what you say others have no right to, and your strawman arguments. I push forward, however, because if you are right, then you'll have solved the mystery that plagues me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial. They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run.
</p></blockquote><p>Look, this reminds me of vague virtue-theoretic arguments. You're basically saying &quot;appropriately fixate and deny meaning&quot; in the right ways, at the right times, for the right reasons. Great. You've uttered a truism. Have you actually provided us the content of these maxims though? </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.
</p></blockquote><p>This is a definition I am not yet in a position to argue against. I worry that Nebulosity as a phenomena may be Nebulous, but that might be your point. I am worried about your use of &quot;all,&quot; of course. I'm fighting the urge to throw away your work as gibberish, but I can see this work is no accident.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form.
</p></blockquote><p>There seems to be something right about that. It's induction and empiricism. I take it this person is against Rationalism and even refuses aspects of Kant's moves.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>From point of view of the complete stance, eternalism and nihilism are each half right. Eternalism rightly recognizes that the world is meaningful to us, and that it must be accepted as it is. This is the acknowledgement of pattern: the world in all its variety, pain and pleasure alike. Nihilism rightly recognizes that there is no eternal source of meaning, so there is no ultimate basis or necessity for rejecting anything. This is the acceptance of nebulosity: the chaos and contingency of the world, and the recognition that we are free from divine law.
</p></blockquote><p>I got it, bro. I know your thesis. Let's see how complete your stance really is. Perhaps you don't have a thesis of <em>how the world is</em>, but really about how we ought to think, or you are giving us rounded answers to digging ourselves out of spirals and problematics. Is this just a heuristic device for you?</p></div>
