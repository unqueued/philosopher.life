Mon 8:56 AM
 It was a good weekend ‚Äî ended up having to help take care of [[K]] because he was pretty sick. :(
Mon 8:56 AM
 =(
Mon 8:57 AM
 But we still managed to have fun and he seems to be doing better now, so that‚Äôs good.
Mon 8:57 AM
 I suggested he be a harsh DM to the guy who got him sick.
Mon 8:57 AM
 Now your character has the sniffles
Mon 8:58 AM
 XD
Mon 8:57 AM
 RIP
Mon 8:57 AM
 Unfortunately I think I had a hand in getting him sick too. I sat next to the dude who was sick on game night but never managed to get it... meaning I probably was just a carrier for [[K]].
Mon 8:58 AM
 I feel old
Mon 9:02 AM
 my chillun are having to explain the finer points of this sub to me: https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyasterisks/top/
Mon 9:02 AM
 LOL
Mon 9:31 AM
 Do you feel you have an adequate understanding of it yet?
Mon 9:31 AM
 I do not know
Mon 9:32 AM
 some of it I feel an old school affinity for, it's just an evolution of communication which I never experience
Mon 9:32 AM
 I would have different reactions than some of these people, imho
Mon 9:33 AM
 or, I hope I would?
Mon 9:33 AM
 It's a very emotional place
Mon 9:33 AM
 I agree that it‚Äôs got an old school feel for it.
Mon 9:34 AM
 what do you think of it?
Mon 9:35 AM
 you are obvious adept here
Mon 9:35 AM
 To me it feels like roleplaying-esque messages that are not well received.
Mon 9:35 AM
 lol
Mon 9:35 AM
 yeah
Mon 9:35 AM
 LOL not an adept, no. But I did experience and even participate in a similar type of communication at some point.
Mon 9:35 AM
 You just are weeb enough
Mon 9:36 AM
 aren't*
Mon 9:36 AM
 lolol
Mon 9:36 AM
 I will write my words correctly some day. I've been up since 2
Mon 9:37 AM
 my sleep schedule is out of whack
Mon 9:37 AM
 It is a style of communication most prominent in some furry/fetish communities, yes.
Mon 9:37 AM
 Damn! Why??
Mon 9:37 AM
 I've always wondered if they would let me just walk around without a shirt at a furry convention. I am a bear.
Mon 9:38 AM
 Sleeping like shit for a couple weeks (have my hypotheses).
Mon 9:38 AM
 Ah, I‚Äôm sorry.
Mon 9:38 AM
 Had to use 400 Œºg flubromazolam to force myself to sleep. Catching up on it.
Mon 9:39 AM
 Knocking you unconscious with a bat might help?
Mon 9:39 AM
 that's basically what I did
Mon 9:39 AM
 Hehe
Mon 9:39 AM
 slept 15 hours on Saturday
Mon 9:39 AM
 Shoo.
Mon 9:39 AM
 fell asleep at 8:30 last night
Mon 9:40 AM
 gonna try to make it until 9ish tonight and then wake up fresh /fingers-crossed
Mon 9:40 AM
 ah, so you did get some sleep just at weird hours
Mon 9:40 AM
 Right.
Mon 9:40 AM
 Good luck, man. Sleep cycles are nuts.
Mon 9:40 AM
 lol
Mon 9:40 AM
 But yeah, you probably could walk around shirtless at a furry convention and not get weird looks.
Mon 9:40 AM
 Somewhere I finally belong
Mon 9:41 AM
 XD
Mon 9:41 AM
 Be freeeeee
Mon 9:41 AM
 Calling in a favor:
Mon 11:40 AM
 I am considering reaching out to my donors. Not sure if I should, and I'm not sure how I should do it. I'd like your digested advice. Give me something to think on. Be prepared for me to wrestle with your claim, please. Take your time in formulating your thoughts, please.
Mon 11:41 AM
 I'm considering asking [[K]] for his perspective too, but I think it is a big ask of him. He has a unique outsider perspective.
Mon 11:42 AM
 Why exactly are you wanting to reach out?
Mon 1:00 PM
 Because it is an extension of T42T (The Golden Rule) that I attempt to create cooperation. You must turn the other cheek more than once. In a vacuum, my current guess on the most moral algorithm requires one to attempt to reconcile with an exponentially increasing interval.
Mon 1:36 PM
 Part of me thinks it might also make my children happier in the end.
Mon 1:37 PM
 I have this sliver of hope that it is possible to reconcile.
Mon 1:37 PM
 I do not want to be accountable for not having tried my best. I want to be able to look back and make sure I carried my end of the bargain, to be justified, no matter what happens.
Mon 1:38 PM
 I think the task is a huge risk, and I do not predict I will succeed.
Mon 1:39 PM
 Gotta say, the utilitarian in me is not convinced this is the correct application of T42T. The Kantian (limbic) side of me says it is. I have a serious conflict in myself here.
Mon 1:40 PM
 You are not the only person I'm asking. I'm asking everyone that I trust for advice here. You all know me, and I know I can be wrong. I want to see it through your lenses here.
Mon 1:43 PM
 I see.
Mon 1:46 PM
 Hearing you want my advice means a lot, honestly. And I do think this could be a huge risk for you. But I agree that if you want to feel like you actually tried your best that this is something you really need to consider. (Which you already are, so good on you.)
Mon 1:47 PM
 Would you mind taking a couple days to think about for me?
Mon 1:48 PM
 (or as long as you'd like)
Mon 1:48 PM
 Absolutely! Those were just my initial thoughts.
Mon 1:51 PM
 I appreciate it. Thank you. =)
Mon 1:52 PM
 I just hope at the end of it that some good comes out of it for you.
Mon 1:54 PM
 I know that my situation is not at all comparable to yours, but I do feel we share a connection as the older siblings ‚Äî we see the shit our parents do and grow up with it, watching our younger siblings go through everything and attempting to help them process it.
Mon 1:58 PM
 aye!
Mon 1:59 PM
 And struggling when they seem to get the short end of the stick because we feel it‚Äôs our fault...
Mon 1:59 PM
 Well, maybe that‚Äôs just me.
Mon 1:59 PM
 I'm not sure why you think you are at fault.
Mon 2:00 PM
 I also think you are a much better force in your sister's life than you admit.
Mon 2:02 PM
 Well, I may talk a good talk but I honestly don‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time with her.
Mon 4:26 PM
 And that‚Äôs what frustrates me. When I DO get time with her it‚Äôs not us alone, which makes the open discussions harder as well.
Mon 4:27 PM
 ah, why don't get you have alone time with her?
Mon 4:28 PM
 Does she not like to message/call much?
Mon 4:28 PM
 It just doesn‚Äôt happen all that much in large chunks. She‚Äôs getting to a point in her life when she‚Äôs busy as well.
Mon 4:28 PM
 And no, she doesn‚Äôt really ever use her phone.
Mon 4:28 PM
 ah
Mon 4:29 PM
 At least not with me.
Mon 4:28 PM
 Is that weird?
Mon 4:29 PM
 I never know how much time my own children should be on their phones.
Mon 4:29 PM
 For her no. For kids her age yes.
Mon 4:29 PM
 Well, ‚Äúshould‚Äù is very relative.
Mon 4:29 PM
 I can't abide by them having their phones in their rooms when it's time to sleep. They have to leave them downstairs. But, they are required to have them active, sound-on, ready to respond at all times when they go out or when I leave them at home.
Mon 4:30 PM
 They obviously can't be playing on it during school, but they can use it to communicate.
Mon 4:31 PM
 They have a tendency to want to play with their phones during chores, of course. Lol. =)
Mon 4:31 PM
 Right.
Mon 4:31 PM
 Still, I know that other kids are likely more adept phone users than mine, and I do not wish to put them at any disadvantage.
Mon 4:32 PM
 They cannot be phone illiterate like me.
Mon 4:32 PM
 My sister is more stuck on her iPad. She is constantly on Netflix/Hulu consuming media.
Mon 4:32 PM
 A wise stance.
Mon 4:32 PM
 My family is unfortunately not with that ‚Äî my sister doesn‚Äôt seem to communicate with anyone independent of them and it‚Äôs VERY unhealthy in my opinion.
Mon 4:32 PM
 I could be wrong though.
Mon 4:32 PM
 You know, I've found a lot people actually prefer their online lives on a tablet. I think that is interesting.
Mon 4:33 PM
 But... keyboards...
Mon 4:33 PM
 ikr
Mon 4:34 PM
 In the end, I pour everything I can into their computing time, since I am convinced that is the most important of physical computing tools they should master.
Mon 4:34 PM
 phone is an afterthought most of the time
Mon 4:35 PM
 I make sure they've installed the right apps, sync between the PCs and phone, and let them do whatever.
Mon 4:35 PM
 ANyways, I'm sorry your sister doesn't seem to use her phone with you.
Mon 4:35 PM
 Maybe she will use her ipad with you.
Mon 4:35 PM
 Maybe...
Mon 4:35 PM
 Perhaps I just need to pester her until she responds like some good people I know.
Mon 4:35 PM
 assholes
Mon 4:36 PM
 =)
Mon 4:36 PM
 Nope, just people who know I‚Äôm hardheaded.
Mon 4:36 PM
 We are the hardheaded club. What are the rules for membership?
Mon 4:37 PM
 I think rule number one should be: don't talk about hardheaded club
Mon 4:37 PM
 XD
Mon 4:37 PM
 Yesss
Mon 4:37 PM
 Wait, is this the part where I start fighting myself?
Mon 4:38 PM
 I have the lye upstairs; if we get me some lipo, boom...we're cookin.
Mon 4:39 PM
 XD
Mon 4:39 PM
 I should watch that again. It‚Äôs been way too long.
Mon 4:39 PM
 a damned good movie
Mon 4:40 PM
 Maybe I should watch a movie with the kids everyday for a while.
Mon 4:41 PM
 Movie niiiiiight
Mon 4:41 PM
 They've grown tired of LOTR, and so I have to stop!
Mon 4:42 PM
 Boooooooo
Mon 4:41 PM
 You will watch the extended versions and you will LIKE IT
Mon 4:42 PM
 If it's not magic, I can't have them consume it. They have to be old enough to adore it.
Mon 4:42 PM
 XD
Mon 4:42 PM
