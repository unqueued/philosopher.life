<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Well, I‚Äôve botted 10k G or so on my Rogue and spent a great deal of that. I have 2k left, nothing to buy. Fully enchanted. I‚Äôm without question the best 1v1 player on the server. But, for the life of me, I can‚Äôt find a good teammate. Lots of decent ones, Zombienoir and Aesop do a good job. However, it is clear that they are still not top notch. I call blinds, sap, target switches, and focus fires‚Ä¶and they aren‚Äôt quick enough. They just haven‚Äôt mastered the ability to talk/listen on ventrilo and play at the same time. We are rogues‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt break the 1850 rating without high levels of communication. So, arena is failing for me. Too bad dueling is gone. I‚Äôm tired of it.</p><p>So‚Ä¶..I start a warlock. Botted his ass to 30 real quick. I expect him to get 70 in 2-3 weeks. Gearing him up won‚Äôt be very easy I assume. +damage/+stam are the stats I‚Äôm looking for, and those are highly sought after. Drain tanking pwns. It is the beauty of resource conversions at its finest in this class. It exemplifies the very principles of offense/defense ratios. It is beautiful‚Äìthe core of economical comparative advantage.</p><p>What is drain tanking? Easy. Load your target with DoTs, and used a very improved Drain life to convert mana to hit points while dealing damage. Chew through mana with lifetap. You have NET gains in many fights. The less you are hit the better. From my math, it looks like Dark pact (just eating my pets mana for mine, stupidly good) will put this tactic over the top. I‚Äôll go succy for spirit regen on his mana and taking adds.</p><p>Getting used to the global CD going from 1 to 1.5 sucks though. Timing is very important for the class though. Long cast-&gt;instant-&gt;kite-repeat is common enough.</p><p>Reminds me. F‚Äôing warrior 5-6 levels above me jumps my character while botting. Looks like my bot did very well against him (D-tanked him though, pfft). I come back, kinda pissed‚Ä¶I go for him. I dance him to death, literally keeping my 36 yard spell reach, but outside his intercept range. Eventually, when I softened him up (he was running for his city, kiting me as I had kited him earlier to ours), I actually let him double back on me. Ate my fear, and that was she wrote as he ate Incin+SB+Nightfall‚Äôs SB. This class is fun. I feel like a necromancer again.</p></div>
