This is not an argumentative paper designed to take others from point A to point B. My notes move me that way, but I make no claims it will for anyone else. I see it, but that doesn't mean someone else will. That's fine. This really is for me. </p><p>Define culture. Define evolution. Now, define cultural evolution.</p><p>Apparently, evolutionary psychologists are interested in cultural evolution based on genetic evolution rather than socially memetic. Oblique transmission, the inheritance, and transfer of traits, etc. from those outside our vertical heritage (our parents) demonstrate the strength of memetics in evolution. </p><p>The article talks about transmission as it relates to fitness. It is important to see that there is a &quot;fit for.&quot; Fitness for memetic transmission isn't the same as fitness for the specimen's survival in a particular circumstance, is not the same as fitness for genetic transmission, is not the same as fitness for producing blue eyes, and so on and so forth. It is the classic &quot;good for&quot; problematic. Once see you see &quot;fitness&quot; as being particularized to perhaps an infinite set of contexts, you will find different kinds of aspects, traits, genes, and memes thriving and dying off. It makes far more sense.</p><p>Let us also be clear that &quot;fitness&quot; is heuristic at best, stochastic, chaotic, and even butterfly-effective. It's perhaps too complex to ultimately model in any practical sense.</p><p>Prestige and conformist biases are fascinating. Ultimate fitness accounts require giving virtue-theoretic accounts to all particularist cases. It would be the complete CI, with a decision procedure calculated for all possible contexts. </p><p>Cultural evolutionism is obviously correct. You'd be a complete fucking moron with some variant of a Tabula Rasa stick up your ass (I'm looking at you blind Kantians) to not see it. This is redpilled, and hence, accepting our base evil will be so &quot;controversial&quot; and unpopular that it will be ignored and attacked, until they said they believed it all along.</p><p>Does it matter what Darwin thought? He started the seed of the idea, but we're the ones who cultivated it. This isn't foundational metaphysical theory or anything, for which we might look back to the origins of the thought for guidance. Is this just about having the historical account to see how we've changed our understanding, and this then allows us to see what may change in our own views given enough time and research? </p><p>It is important to remember Wittgenstein's skepticism about rule-following when thinking about memes. Transmission of memes are very garbled, scrambled, and often not perfectly replicated. That's the point! Importantly, the depth and application of the transmitted principle or idea, the way in which it coherently (or incoherently) fits (or doesn't) fit into the receiver's web of beliefs is key to understanding the transformation of the meme. Memetic evolution is rapidly complex.</p><p>Of course, social scientists with a bluepilled vendetta are not going to accept cultural evolution. </p><p>I have no idea what it means to say cultural evolution makes sense without memes. I don't think you can even fucking define &quot;culture&quot; without deferring to memes (of which, cultural units are reducible or identical to). And, you certainly can't accurately describe who we are and how we evolve without understanding both the genetic and memetic elements that comprise our identities.</p><p>I have already talked about &quot;Cultural units are not replicators&quot; when referring to Wittgenstein. To say memes don't exist if they aren't perfect replicators is to miss the point entirely. Genes also don't follow this perfectly either. Cultural units just are memes (although, I'm not sure if it is the other way around). Representations need not be identical. The transfer of memes is about as ugly as teaching someone by showing them in the shop, teaching by example, forcing them to undergo some experience, or telling them with words. It's not simple, straightforward, or almost ever identical. This is not an argument against memes, only an argument against some strawman conception of memes. </p><p>Ideas may not be memes, but all ideas which are mentally represented in our minds, whether consciously or subconsciously, are in fact memes by definition. This article is absurd here. It's so fucking obvious. </p><p>This 'attractor' notion of &quot;culturally shared patterns of thought&quot; just is a meme. Idiots! Memes need not be atomic. They can be complex. These people have forgotten about kinds, sets, orders, and object-oriented ontology.</p><p>The claim that &quot;Cultural units do not form lineages&quot; is fucking absurd. Note the difference between a theoretical truth here (that there is a truth) and our practical ability to identify it. Why should we think there needs to be one source? It's not like particular genes or patterns of genes have a single source either. Don't be absurd. This is a shit retort.</p><p>Let me grant that genetic evolution and memetic evolution may be wildly different. Who cares? That makes sense right? One is hardware, the other is software. I expect them to be wildly different because they serve different functions! Only a foolish memeticist would hold them to be hard and fast similar. </p><p>Again, &quot;Culture cannot be atomized into discrete units&quot; is just a rehash of the previous claim. No shit Sherlock. This is a straight up strawman of memetics. </p><p>It is here that sciences destroy the Imago Dei, of our infantilized romantic picture of Humanity. I'm not a scientist and I don't subscribe to any religion of science either. They clearly have arguments you can't deal with though. This is most unfortunate. You stand in a crisis of faith. Long did I think science and religion were fully compatible; I fought very hard for it. Now I see, in broadening my definition of religion to include many romantic secular humanists, that science does sit in conflict. That doesn't make it always right, but it shows a clear divide in The Great Human Conversation.</p><p>Cultural evolution without memes or replicators is either missing a fundamental building block or straw-manning. </p><p>I do agree, as I said before, with the pragmatic problems of the study of cultural evolution. We may only be able to do theory for a while. It is important to see that this is a bio-epistemic offshoot of computer science. We don't even have the math to describe the mind yet. It's no wonder it remains theoretical and barely practical. If economics is a dismal science, memetics is a thousand leagues more abysmally abyssal. I cannot deny it exists though. I can only deny that I do not have the answers.</p><p>At this point, since memetics may lack explanatory powers, depending on your philosophy of science, you may not want to call it science. Of course, I think you've missed the problem of induction and empiricism entirely. It's just very soft and deeply theoretical at this point. That's okay though, right? Think of the sciences which have hardened and become practical through the ages because we kept shaping it and pushing the boundaries. Memetics may be the same way.</p><p>I'm going to tell you an important secret, friend. The Humanities, the study, and engagement in the The Great Human Conversation, is ultimately engaged in Memetics. It is inescapable. We are computers, friend. We're programming ourselves and each other in our conversations, in our actions, in our information transmissions, and so forth. We are memeticists in the ready-at-hand mode. We do it without thinking, without even knowing what we are doing in a sense. We are inarticulate about it. Memes are at the very core of who we take ourselves to really be though. We are the memetic software machinations living on top of our genetic hardware through the ages. Welcome to your loss of innocence, yet again. The truth rapes we the romantically ignorant.</p></div>
