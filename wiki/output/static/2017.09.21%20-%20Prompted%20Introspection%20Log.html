<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What do you think of your cousin L's occupational choices thus far?</h2><p>It's a very tempting spot to be in. I understand the need for income, especially when the economy and political situation is even more problematic for younger people. </p><p>L waffles. Part of her sees the evil of the company she works for, but part of her tries not to care. Again, the money is really important to her happiness. I get it. I really do.</p><p>Her current belief is that she is working her way out of her position. She will climb the ladder inside her company until she can make a lateral move to a position elsewhere for a company that isn't &quot;as evil.&quot; Imho, she isn't actually trying to evaluate what counts as evil though. As long as it isn't &quot;too evil,&quot; that is good enough possibly, or so I am worried she thinks. </p><p>She would prefer something medical or environmental. In a way, as she points out, it's hard to ethically enter into a world where money is the everything (ethics almost irrelevant) with a chemical engineering degree.</p><p>She has misunderstood my occupational/vocational distinction. I think she believes she can balance the bad things that come out of her occupational choice with good things that come out of her free time.</p><p>As always, you can be wealthy or you can be moral, which to some degree means you have to choose between happiness and morality. Oh, of course, the American Dream is all about trying to demonstrate how this is a false dichotomy. It isn't. The Bible is hilariously clear on this point, and to a redpilled atheist like me, it is even clearer.</p><p>Of course, I love L. I want her to be happy. As always, ignorance is bliss, even if it lacks integrity. It's a hard place to be in. L is also quite optimistic, but she is also smart. If she pays attention, she will see I am right. It is a sad day either way.</p></div>
