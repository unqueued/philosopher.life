<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I arrived 3 minutes late! Nobody was there. I sat and typed for quite a while. Thankfully, everyone was late this Friday.</p><p>We got to workin' on Room #4's pipe. Jaye was still off. I think he feels disrespected. Now it was a bunch of small things he wanted to coach me on and be obstinate about. He wasn't his usual self with me. We broke the tacks on a threadolet because it wasn't quite right. He went and retrieved a new one and a made a fuss for no reason. The threadolet we had was completely workable. He wanted to be a prima donna about it. It was a long morning dealing with his attitude, poor inferences, etc. Placating the irrationality of your partner is valuable, instrumental, and even if it is manipulative, ultimately may be worth it.</p><p>We ended up talking about racism again. It is something we have a common point of view on, by and large. I'm trying to work from common ground here. Bull saw us talking about it, and decided to change the conversation with some of his stories.</p><p>We went on break. On the break, while calling my daughter, I saw messages from Tim, including an e-mail that I got the job, starting Monday! Woot! Also, at 3pm tomorrow I pick up my tools at the Dunkin Donuts near my house. That will be awesome. I had to think about what I was going to say to Bull.</p><p>I told Bull, and I explained how much I appreciated working for/with him. I complimented him, and it went smoothly. Bull said he understood and congratulated me. I then called Barry, since that is Bull's boss. Barry told me he understood, and that if I ever wanted to come back to give him a call (yay, I didn't burn a bridge, at least not with Barry). I then went to see Pam.</p><p>I visited Pam, and there wasn't much to do. She kept trying to pierce through me, as usual. I smiled and thanked her, etc.</p><p>Jaye called and said he was calling it a day. He didn't want to work the rest of it. I'm not sure why. He said to get in contact with him up and talk to him about my new job. </p><p>I then went to clean up my stuff at the residence. I met William. He just became head chef. Movin' on up! We talked. I learned that he is a felon for &quot;kidnapping&quot; but then he explained the story (it was a bogus charge, and I know enough about William to see he isn't like that). We shook hands and exchanged numbers. </p><p>I hit a Southern Food + Greek Fusion restaurant which was dirt cheap. Called Armstrong, and he was non-plussed. Said congratz, etc.</p></div>
