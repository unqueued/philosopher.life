<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The Chosen thing is clearly here. It's weird that I connect with plenty of pseudo-Christ figures, but not HP. It's not like I don't have things in common with HP, but I don't feel moved by him in the way that I do other figures like Owen Meany.</p><p>Again, the (invisibility) clock and dagger thing. It's a fun mechanic.</p><p>I think Malfoy would have done far more than he does here. I also think it's weird that Malfoy's wealth doesn't translate into having more magical objects than he does. In fact, I don't see why HP doesn't either with his wealth.</p><p>See...Hermione is the first to succeed. It's bullshit that she doesn't get Outstanding.</p><p>Liquid Luck is retarded. That would be used all day erry day by erry one.</p><p>It really feels like the older generation were just flat out better at magic as teenagers than the kids in this story.</p><p>These magical tools remind me of being a kid walking through magazines and engaging in pretend games with my brother.</p><p>How is it that the half-blood prince is more accurate than the book? It legit doesn't make sense.</p><p>Oh yeah, I forgot that these memories are modified.</p><p>Not taking Hagrid's class seems reasonable enough, right?</p><p>Resolving this series likely required a lot of forcing.</p><p>How do they make new spells? I have so many questions that Rowling deviously doesn't answer.</p><p>I love having the history of our villain. There's really no way to appreciate him without it.</p><p>There are a lot of aspects of this story which are fragmented about memory. I appreciate that.</p><p>I feel like I'm watching Star Wars.</p><p>Dark Triadicism is cleanly displayed. Dumbledore clearly attempted in incite it.</p><p>Hrmm...HP makes an inference that I think he could not about the parseltongue fact with-holding. This was forced.</p><p>Placebo gaslight (not all placebo is that).</p></div>
