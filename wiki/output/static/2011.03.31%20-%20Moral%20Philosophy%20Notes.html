There are varieties of expertise, inquiry, action, undertaking which each have an end. </p><p>Is there a dominant end which is the reason of all other ends (serving as the means to this dominant end)? 
In the chain of means/ends relationships, does there have to be a dominant, final end - a stopping point?</p><p>Of course, he is going to deny the infinite regress.</p><p>Find an end which is 'good' in itself and not merely a means to that good.</p><p>If there is no final, &quot;Superior&quot; end, then you simply don't know which 'mean'-ends to select.</p><p>Are the varieties of ends listed in the beginning pursued for their own sakes or for something else? Aristotle claims they are for somethign else.</p><p>What is the final end? Happiness.</p><p>What makes us different from other creatures? Reason.</p><p>Our happiness, as a final end, is likely linked to our reason. </p><p>Humans make choices (prohairesis). What choices you make, to a large extent, are determined by your character. Character is destiny.</p><p>Happiness requires more than having a virtuous character, but also having 'moral luck' (Bernard Williams' term).</p><p>That which is right is that is which 'perceived' by the virtuous person.</p><p>The political expert (the person for whom this book is written) is interested in organizing society as a whole. A political expert (of city-states) will be the highest because all other expertises fall under the hierarchy of political expertise.</p><p>In Book 1.3, Aristotle claims that morality lacks exactness, and rather it is 'fuzzy'. Moral precision is weak. Only the virtuous agent may, by inclination, choose with precision (despite lacking an explicit articulation of what and why, etc.).</p><p>Who do we ask? Not the young, they are driven by emotion (rather than reason exclusively). </p><p>The precondition to understanding what ethics is about is having been raised in a certain way. Otherwise, it will not appeal to you and you can't understand it. </p><p>Book 1.4 - Happiness is 'living well' and 'doing well' - The full exercise of reason (doing philosophy) is what distinguishes us from everything else. </p><p>Book 1.7 - The ultimate end is self-sufficient and complete.</p><p>Something can be 'desirable for itself' or 'desirable for something else' or 'both desirable for itself and something else' - clearly the hierarchy of desirability follows:</p><p>for itself (alone) - intrinsically good
for itself and for something else
for something else</p><p>Happiness is 'good without qualification'</p><p>We can ask &quot;why do you want to play piano?&quot; etc., but it apparently makes no sense to ask &quot;why do you want to be happy?&quot;.</p><p>If we can distinguish the plants, animals, and humans, and as biologists we can provides arguments about the 'function' of other creatures, then we should also attempt to determine the function of man (ultimately, reason).</p><p>If your desires are properly aligned to your proper purpose and obedient to your reason, then you will be engaged in an activity which is directly related to your happiness. Exercising the best part of our soul, reason, and being virtuous, are central to being truly happy.</p><p>The notion of &quot;Happiness&quot; must be very carefully understood. There is more to happiness than external goods and goods of the body. This is why the mafioso isn't truly happy.</p><p>1099a20 - Virtue is somehow both necessary and sufficient for happiness, and nothing else is required (further, nothing else could even be sufficient).</p><p>The virtuous activity itself is a pleasure to the individual who is performing it. You can't separate the two. </p><p>1.10 - What is the duration of the happiness? It is a summation of the course of a lifetime. Aristotle makes an argument concerning the happiness of descendents.</p><p>Just as virtue is stable, constant, firm-rooted, not easily subject to change, disposed, ingrained, and lasting, happiness must also be. The interval of happiness and virtue cannot be short or temporal. Virtue is not habituated overnight, nor is it lost overnight. Likewise, happiness is neither gained nor lost overnight.</p><p>Jan 25</p><p>1.7</p><p>Most complete, most self-sufficient, most desirable, 'without qualification' - Happiness fits these.</p><p>The task of the political expert and the task of the individual are different. The political expert must generate a society in which is it possible for the individuals to be happy. Happiness is the strictest end of individuals. Political experts actually do have to worry about everyone's happiness in a way that individuals may not, necessarily.</p><p>Ethics is divided into &quot;moral philosophy&quot; and &quot;political philosophy&quot; - the differences being whether the scope is about the individual or society as a whole.</p><p>Function argument- </p><p>flute player	‚Äì essential, characteristic activity or function is: playing flute well
eyes 		‚Äì essential, characteristic activity or function is: to see well</p><p>Man, who is a part of nature, has a purpose. Aristotle's teleology is extremely pronounced here.</p><p>Human		‚Äì essential, characteristic activity or function is: ....</p><p>The function of man is intimately linked to 'the soul'. </p><p>Happiness is acheived by performing one's function well. </p><p>Of course, the soul of human (unlike plants and animals) has unique to it the ability to reason.</p><p>Nutrition and non-rational aspects of the souls (e.g. desires) can pay attention or heed the last aspect, namely rational.</p><p>Jan 27</p><p>the highest good - eudaimonia</p><p>Disposition - v1, v2,...,vn - possession and exercisizing</p><p>There must be a great deal of stability. These are not fleeting feelings. </p><p>Eudaimonia is supposed to objective. You can be wrong about your conception of Eudaimonia, if you are not a virtuous agent especially. There objective properties of a thing which determine what it means for that thing to flourish. There are objective, 'naturalistic' properties of man which determine fitness and flourish-rating of each individual.</p><p>He is not guilty of the 'quantifier shift' - </p><p>(For all x)(There exists y)(F(xy))
(There exists y)(For all x)(F(xy))</p><p>‚ÄòEvery method of production and every type of inquiry, similarly also every action and purpose, seems to aim at some good. That is why people have declared, correctly so, that goodness is what anything aims at.'</p><p>It is not the case that:</p><p>From ‚Äò‚ÄòEach thing aims at some good or other‚Äô‚Äô it would not follow that ‚Äò‚ÄòThere is some single good at which all things aim.‚Äô‚Äô</p><p>Lower inquiries and expertises has its own unique goal, perhaps even its own unique good, but these lower things are done for the sake of higher goals, perhaps higher inquiries and expertises, which likewise follow the same pattern. This process repeats until the ultimate goal of the political expert is reached.</p><p>Thus Aristotle proposes the following principle of comparison: when X and Y are goals, and X is for the sake of Y, then Y is better than X. Note that the ‚Äò‚Äòfor the sake of‚Äô‚Äô relation establishes a ranking, too, among the actions and products of a practitioner of any discipline. A housebuilder acts for the sake of the building of the house, and this implies an order, and a basis of comparison, for everything that he does, as a builder.</p><p>pg. 48-50ish in Pakaluk</p><p>Goals are not just comparable (commensurable). Political experts must choose between incommensurable goals. </p><p>1. Each discipline has a goal (or good) at which it aims.
2. The higher the discipline, the better its goal (or good).
3. If there is a highest discipline, then there is a best goal (or good).
4. There is a highest discipline.
5. Thus, there is a best goal (or good).</p><p>Political expertise is more than force and power, it must be about reason and knowledge. Political expertise directs all other expertises. A highest good does indeed exist, it is the goal of political expertise.</p><p>Way of life 			‚Äì Highest good

Collection/Collective/[Comprehensive goal] of several goods</p><p>What is the criteria for the highest good? 
1) Complete (ultimate, or ultimacy, nothing beyond it, etc.)
2) Self-sufficient
3) Preferability (Pakaluk suggests)</p><p>How many virtues must we exercise to produce virtuous actons, etc.?</p><p>Perhaps there are sub-goods ordered which are necessary for the ultimate good. This contains both the selective and collective views, in some sense. But, it seems that it is plagued with the means/end argument, and thus it still seems selective. Part of the question, in my view, is whether or not the 'means' are necessary and unchangable or unreplaceable, and un-reorderable, which are usually things which are part of means. Replacing my bike with a car is an improvement, for example, in the means to certain travel ends. This may or may not be possible in the ultimate good argument.</p><p>The &quot;highest good&quot; has the problem of it being the ultimate ulterior motive. It seems very egoist.</p><p>Does it make any sense to say that you love someone ‚Äò‚Äòfor his own sake, for your sake‚Äô‚Äô? Or that you do something ‚Äò‚Äòfor its own sake, for your own sake‚Äô‚Äô?</p><p>But I say: What abut &quot;For his own sake, and for your sake&quot; ... or &quot;For its own sake, and for your own sake&quot;</p><p>From the ultimate goal selective view, it seems that you might be justified in doing just anything to reach it. Of course, we can simply posit that you can't achieve the ultimate goal using non-virtuous means, and that virtuous means are extraordinarily limited to such a small subset that you won't be about to do 'just anything to reach' the ultimategoal.</p><p>The ultimate goal seems to structure all other activities and sub-goals of the life of the virtuous agent.</p><p>criterion - pg 67ish</p><p>Feb 3</p><p>Human beings have a function. Pak 76?
What is that function? Pak 77</p><p>Interrelatedness/Interdefinability of function, goodness, and virtue - pg. 6 and </p><p>Lacking the human virtues is like having a blunt blade, and thus you aren't performing the function as well as you, and thus you can't reach the highest good.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of the Function Argument, as I said, is to argue that the highest human good is to be found among those things that we can do only because we have the virtues.</p><p>ergon = function</p><p>&quot;of that for the sake of which it exists&quot; - the knife exists for cutting. Take away its function to cut, and it is no longer a knife. Analogy to human function.</p><p>A virtue is a trait that makes a thing of a certain kind good and in view of which we call a thing of that kind ‚Äò‚Äògood.‚Äô‚Äô</p><p>Human beings have a function, a purpose, a telos. There is a reason for its existence and a normative structure to how it should exist.</p><p>Here, the 'potentiality/actuality' distinction is quite important. Virtue is about actualizing your humanity.</p><p>It seems, however, that descriptions aren't necessarily the same thing as teleology. But, if his teleology is correct, and the classification of thing is important to understanding what a thing is, then we might have to agree to the function argument.</p><p>What is the connection between human virtues and reason? Also, we have to properly condition our irrational parts, namely our desires.</p><p>if anyone with a function should reasonably take as his good the doing of that function well, then he should take as his good the achieving of that function in the way that a good practitioner of the function does</p><p>Feb 8</p><p>CH. 13, &quot;minimalist psychology&quot;</p><p>soul ('psuche')</p><p>There is an 'aspect' of the soul which is nutritive part of the soul, for growth and development. There are two other very significant aspects of the soul. There is 'reason' or 'rational' aspect. There is also the desiderative (desires) part or aspect. The desiderative and nutritive aspects are non-rational (obv.). Interestingly, the desiderative aspects 'heeds reason', whereas the nutritive does not. The desiderative aspect has a special capacity to heed reason. Desiderative and reason aspects can be transformed and changed. And, the Virtues, thus, are associated with both the desiderative and rational aspects of the soul.</p><p>Contemplation (book 10) plays an extremely important part of virtue and becoming like the God (the latter especially). It is extremely connected, obv., to reason. </p><p>Eudaimonia is connected to excellence, which is the result of the activity of the soul. Thus, the nature/structure of the soul is very important in determining what it means to be eudaimonic. </p><p>Virtues are connected to human goodness. And the virtues are thus connected to the activity of the human soul. </p><p>Virtuous<u></u><u></u><u></u>Self-Control<u></u><u></u><u></u><u>Lack Self-Control</u><u></u><u></u><u></u>_Vicious</p><p>The virtuous is such that his desires are so in tuned with his reason that he doesn't need to fight within himself to do the right thing. He doesn't have desires which conflict with his reason. The person in self-control, however, has desires which are in conflict with reason, but he chooses what is reasonable. The person not in self-control has desires in conflict with reason, and he chooses what his desires demand. The vicious doesn't even 'know' what he ought to be doing. He doesn't have a conflict in him, he just entirely wants the wrong thing, to the same extent that the virtuous person entirely wants the right thing.</p><p>Reason gives the 'right encouragement' and the 'right direction'.</p><p>Reason gives you intellectual excellences. 
e.g. intellectual accomplishment, good sense, and wisdom</p><p>Desires give you excellences of character.
e.g. mild-mannered and moderate</p><p>Excellence of activity of the soul can be achieved by any human.</p><p>A virtue is ‚Äò‚Äòwhat it is about a thing which makes it such that it perform its function well.‚Äô‚Äô</p><p>Thus, some parts of an instrument or appliance (e.g. the water
filter, the heating element) are such that, if they are good, their being
good contributes to that instrument‚Äôs being good, without qualifica-
tion; and other parts of a thing (e.g. the electric cord) are such that, if
they are good, their being good contributes to that instrument‚Äôs
being good only in a qualified way.</p><p>Perhaps, then, 'good health' and the nutritive aspect of the health could be considered 'good in a qualified way'. </p><p>This makes sense given his teleology &quot;rational biped&quot; - having two legs seems 'essential'.</p><p>Feb 10</p><p>Nature/Nurture - what is &quot;moral education&quot;</p><p>Human Excellence

CH. 4 - </p><p>What does pain and pleasure have to do with morality?</p><p>1. nothing
2. everything
3. baseline - minimal conditions for morality
4. for education and discipline</p><p>Pleasure is a good sign of someone's character. If they take 'pleasure' in doing what is a right act, then that indicates that they have the right sort of character.</p><p>Education is extremely important to Aristotle.</p><p>Aristotle argues against the Socratic doctrine (&quot;Virtue is knowledge&quot;) - which is that people choose what they think is right, even if they happen to be wrong about it. Aristotle, obv., believes there must be a non-knowledge, non-reason component to Virtue.</p><p>But if someone with merely natural virtue does not develop into a truly
virtuous person in this way, then these natural tendencies will even-
tually lead him astray ‚Äì and perhaps do so to a greater degree, the
more striking his natural gifts originally were</p><p>Feb 17</p><p>Skills - You can read all you want about brain surgery and medicine, and learn all there is to know, and 'reason' your way through as much medicine as you want. But, you won't necessarily be very good without actually practice, doing, and habituation. Likewise for Cello, Housebuilder, etc. This is parallel to Virtue. Everyone can read and educate themselves about Virtue, but you also need to cultivate character through practice and action to actually become good at it and to truly change who you are.</p><p>In the beginning you can have natural characteristics of Virtue. But, natural dispositions like this aren't the same. &quot;Hexis&quot; (disposition). Natural virtues can be cultivated to become actual virtue. </p><p>The Doctrine of Mean (discuss next week in depth) - There is at one end Excess and on the other end deficiency. In the middle is the intermediate.</p><p>1. We acquire a character-related virtue by performing actions similar
to those of people who have that virtue (1103a31‚Äìb6). </p><p>2. We acquire a character-related virtue not by performing certain
kinds of actions, but by performing them in a certain way (1103b6‚Äì21).</p><p>Your Moral life cannot fail to have an impact on you. Even the little things add up to change and habituate your character.</p><p>3. Acting well in a domain involves, initially at least, the avoidance of
contrary extremes (1104a11‚Äì27). </p><p>Hexis prompts act which affects your balance upon the scale of the mean.</p><p>4. There is a kind of momentum in action: to the extent that someone
acts well or poorly in a domain, to that extent he becomes more disposed to
act in that way (1104a27‚Äìb3). </p><hr><p>1) Affections (emotions)
2) Capacities
3) Dispositions</p><p>You are neither praised nor blamed for 1 and 2 in some sense? Since virtues of character can't be 1 or 2, then it must be 3.</p><hr><p>bachelor = 	unmarried 	man
definition	species		genus
Virtue   =	intermediate	state/disposition</p><p>Feb 22</p><p>1) State, disposition {genus}
2) Doctrine of the mean {species}</p><p>Aristotle thinks his excess/means/deficiency is exhaustive, requiring no more.</p><p>The virtuous agent will have virtues, all of them, which lie on the mean.</p><p>The table of virtues isn't relative to any object, it is relative to us.</p><p>Feb 24</p><p>Principle of Discrimination</p><p>A &gt; B</p><p>Voluntary and Involuntary </p><p>Mar 1</p><p>Two factors diminish culpability of agent:
Force, ignorance</p><p>You do have a moral obligation to know the right things, some cases.</p><p>We may be ignorant of (i)particulars or (ii)moral general-
ities. Aristotle holds that ignorance of particulars is sometimes not
culpable, but ignorance of moral generalities is always culpable.</p><p>When an action is not of the agent‚Äôs own accord, as we
have seen, the inference from action to character is blocked.</p><p>If I am not the 'self-server' the self initiater of my action, and there is a story about my action, then it blocks the inference from the act to the character.
Under noraml circumstances we can infer character from act. The act will be a sign of character.</p><hr><p>The way in which an agent deliberates demonstrates virtue.</p><p>1) Appetite (cannot conflict with decision
2) Temper (no)
3) Wish (no)
4) judgment (true or false, but decisions is either right or wrong)</p><p>These things must be sharply distinguished from what constitutes decision.</p><p>According to Aristotle, prohairesis seems to be ‚Äò‚Äòthe
most distinctive mark of virtue, and better than actions for discerning
character‚Äô‚Äô (1111b5‚Äì6).</p><p>(doxa) - Belief or opinion (like Doxology)</p><p>Mar 3 </p><p>III.2 - Aristotle is saying that your intellectual ventures, your ability to make true or false claims about the world, your judgment in this sense, is sharply separate from your moral decision making. Smart judgments doesn't make you a good person. And, being a good person doesn't mean that you have many smart judgments or have reliable beliefs. </p><p>Prohairesis, the choice is significant and important, but Aristotle thinks it isn't predicated on the truth or falsity of other issues, but instead only on the rightness or wrongness of what to do.</p><p>Moral judgments flow from character. WHich is why character, inevitably still the real factor of what motivates action. Judgment, then, still seems amoral, just a means to an end, esesntially.</p><p>Mar 10</p><p>CH. 4 - Wish</p><p>Are we responsible for our characters? Aristotle says 'yes'.</p><p>Is 'X' good by the sheer act of your wishing it? Or is it that X merely appears to be good?</p><p>Good/Value might be subject dependent, and thus not objective.</p><p>We are as responsible for our character as we are for our actions. (1113b10)</p><p>If you habitutate vice enough, then you will be so vicious that even if you wish to do the virtuous thing, you cannot do it. Your character will force you to do the wrong thing. Mere wishing doesn't do anybody any good. </p><p>You can't cop-out and say that you aren't responsible for an action because that is 'simply your character'. But, since you are responsible for your character, then you also are responsible for the end results, even further down the line when you have a vicious character.</p><p>Teleological-Faculty view - teleological because our faculties are geared to understand the objective qualities of the world. So also, your desires and wishes of the virtuous person will be so honed that it is perfected geared to perceive the objective qualities of the moral world.</p><p>A good person, thus, stands as a good measure of ethics.</p><p>But when he adds that ‚Äò‚Äòthe good person is set apart from others to the
greatest extent by seeing what is truly so in each case‚Äô‚Äô (a31‚Äì32), he is
invoking the Teleological-Faculty view and suggesting that the phe-
nomena of wishing for the good should be understood according to a
focal or central-case analysis: the various bad conditions of wishing
should be interpreted as various ways of falling away from the
naturally good condition.</p><p>The habituation that leads to one who can't control themselves, because their character overrides everything else, is voluntary, and thus even those who can't control themselves, voluntarily have gotten there. THey have voluntarily made themselves the way they are.</p><p>The argument of the chapter is complex, but we can distinguish four
basic stages: the fundamental argument (1113b3‚Äì21); a confirming
argument (1113b21‚Äì1114a13); a diagnosis of why people are attracted to
the false view (1114a13‚Äì31); and an afterthought (1114a31‚Äìb25).</p><hr><p>The potential to be good at basketball, the gift of nature (Kant's phrase), does not seem up to us. You can't actualize a potential that you don't have. Moral talents seem to be be moral potentials, possibly. </p><p>Mar 15</p><p>Desires - excellence of character
Reason - excellence of the intellect</p><p>Now, there is a distinction with reason.
A) 'whose principles cannot be otherwise' - Scientific
B) deliberating, can be otherwise - Calculative</p><p>The objects of our inquiry will correspond to different types of reason. </p><p>What constitutes excellence of these types of reason (scientific and calculative)?</p><p>'What constitutes the means'? is a question that is deliberative. I'm deliberating about things which aren't fixed and determined. There must be contemplation about things that I need to do. </p><p>We need to be able to determine action and truth. The things that can determine it are perception, desire, and intelligence.</p><p>Desire - Pursuit and avoidance</p><p>Excellence of character -&gt; Decision -&gt; Desire ‚Äî If you have the right antecedent, then you'll have the right consequent.</p><p>Decision is a result of deliberation. If I haven't properly deliberated, then I will not end up with the right desire.</p><p>The rational prescription must be in place, it must be true. Your desires must also be in line. Reason must assert and desire must pursue the same thing.</p><p>These are different:
Action is an end in itself - done for the sake of the noble, for the sake of the moral, for the sake of itself
Production X end (techne) - end product is different from the activity</p><p>1. Technical expertise
2. Systematic knowledge
3  wisdom
4. intellectual accomplishment

Wisdom - the wise person wants to do the right action, doing the right action because it is an end in itself. That is what connects wisdom to practical life.</p><p>Wisdom is a kind of excellence.</p><p>WIsdom can't be dislodged or forgetten in the same way as technical knowledge.</p><p>Intellectual acccomplishment - demonstrations. Like Axioms-&gt;inference proofs. </p><p>Intelligence is connected to the starting point, the axoim. It isn't the proof as a whole. Intellectual accomplishment when you've gone through the whole demonstration process.</p><p>The theorem is systematic knowledge. </p><p>Wisdom is concerned with human goodness. Thales and Anax weren't interested in wisdom, although what they enjoyed was interesting. Socrates might have been wise, but he might not have been intellectually accomplished (although, even this would be true). The distinction between wisdom and intellectual accomplishment must be strongly drawn.</p><p>If the starting point can't be changed (it must be necessary), then it can't be wisdom, acc. Aristotle.</p><p>Deliberation contrasted to - Judgement, guesses, knowledge</p><p>Mar 22</p><p>The five thinking-related virtues Aristotle distinguishes are:</p><p>1) craftsmanship (techne); technical expertise
2) knowledge (episteme); systematic knowledge
3) administrative ability (phronesis); wisdom?    [Definitely Practical Wisdom]
4) sound intuition (nous); intellectual accomplishment
5) wisdom or ‚Äò‚Äòprofound understanding‚Äô‚Äô (sophia); intelligence?     [Usually, WIsdom]</p><p>Aristotle seems to think that the primacy of wisdom, among the
thinking-related virtues, becomes evident once we develop a satisfac-
tory classification.</p><p>‚Äò‚ÄòStandard View‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì is that Aristotle is raising a difficulty about the
Doctrine of the Mean, involving what I earlier called the ‚Äò‚ÄòProblem of
Guidance‚Äô‚Äô</p><p>There must be a target in order for 'sound reason' to properly function, and bring us to the intermediate (between excess and deficiency).</p><p>Suppose, then, that we make this further distinction and say that in
matters of conduct and appropriate emotional response three things
are necessary: (i) to do what is intermediate, (ii) by making the
adjustments that sound reason indicates, (iii) which sound reason
arrives at with a view to some target or standard. Yet, as Aristotle next
points out in (III), to say this is to give a schema that holds of any
domain of action in which there is some sort of expertise. In all such
domains, it will be true that one needs to use sound reason ‚Äì let us call
it ‚Äò‚Äògood sense‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì with a view to some ideal, when applying or
interpreting relevant maxims. To advance beyond this truism,
Aristotle then says in (IV), one needs to identify the specific sort of
‚Äò‚Äògood sense‚Äô‚Äô that enters into play in some domain and also to
indicate the relevant ‚Äò‚Äòtarget.‚Äô‚Äô This, then, becomes Aristotle‚Äôs task: to
identify the specific sort of ‚Äò‚Äògood sense‚Äô‚Äô that is relevant for ethical
deliberation and action, and to say what this should appropriately
take as its target.</p><p>Good sense in ethical conduct, deliberation, and action. We need to know the target of this good sense. What is its target?</p><p>But once we construe Aristotle‚Äôs purposes in this way, we see that
this is exactly what he carries out in book 6. He devotes the bulk of
the book to identifying the exact sort of ‚Äò‚Äògood sense‚Äô‚Äô that is needed
for character-related virtues, and then he devotes chapters 12‚Äì13 to
explaining what sound reason takes as its ‚Äò‚Äòtarget.‚Äô‚Äô Good sense in
these matters, he maintains, is appropriately called phronesis (‚Äò‚Äòadmin-
istrative ability,‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äòpractical wisdom,‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äòintelligence and foresight in
action,‚Äô‚Äô cf. 6.12.1144b27‚Äì28), and it may be defined as that virtue
which deals with what is good and bad generally for human beings
(1140b5‚Äì7). Its target, Aristotle argues, is speculative or contemplative
activity of the sort that we engage in when we exercise the virtue of
wisdom. In just the same way that medicine makes the relevant
adjustments in the balanced conditions of the body with a view to
its target of health, phronesis makes adjustments in emotions and
conduct with a view to promoting the activity of sophia (cf. 1144a3‚Äì5;
1145a6‚Äì9). Phronesis is for the sake of sophia.</p><p>Good is phronesis. Its target is contemplation necessary for exercising virtue. Phronesis is for Sophia.</p><p>If you are in an appropriate state (of the soul), then you can be assured that a Proposition P is true. Obviously, P might be true, and your soul isn't in the right state, but then you just aren't assured of knowledge.</p><p>Once we appreciate the high standard that Aristotle sets for a trait
to count as a thinking-related virtue, we can understand better his
distinction between two parts of the rational soul.</p><p>1. Things that exist can be divided into (a) those the basic causes of
which cannot be otherwise and (b) those that can be otherwise.
2. This difference is a difference in kind.
3. To grasp something involves resemblance and kinship between
that which does the grasping and that which is grasped.</p><p>This demonstrates why we need two different parts of the soul. Aristotle thinks that different parts of the soul are required to understand or pursue different objects. One object might be about eternal objects, and it has a part of the sould required for it. And another object by the changing the world, and you'll need to a faculty or part of the soul to understand it. Different parts of the soul fr different objects.	</p><p>4. Since there are two kinds of things that exist, there are two kinds
of resemblance and kinship to them.
5. The characteristic work of the thinking part of the soul is to grasp
what exists.
6. Thus, it does so by the two kinds of kinship.
7. But it can have these two kinds of kinship only if it has two parts
which differ in kind.
8. Thus, the thinking part of the soul itself has two parts ‚Äì the
knowledge-attaining part (epistemikon) by which it grasps things
the basic causes of which cannot be otherwise (mathematics and the sciences - eternal), and the reckoning
part (logistikon - calculative), by which it grasps things that can be otherwise. </p><p>When we deliberate we are calculating.</p><p>The way in
which maxims must be left unspecified, because they require sensi-
tivity to particular circumstances, is not something that could be
remedied by giving further rules and prescriptions. </p><p>Sound reason enables you to decide what it is you should do because the sound reason takes into account the complexity of whatever particular situation you happen to find yourself.</p><p>A word should be said about points of translation. ‚Äò‚ÄòSound reason‚Äô‚Äô
renders the Greek, orthos logos, literally ‚Äò‚Äòcorrect reason‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòright
reason.‚Äô‚Äô Sometimes the phrase is taken to refer to a sort of maxim or
prescription: ‚Äò‚Äòthe correct rule‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòthe right principle.‚Äô‚Äô But it is better
to take the phrase to refer principally to a power or faculty (just as, as
we have seen, logos on its own typically indicates a power or faculty).</p><p>orthos logos simply is
the virtue of phronesis (1144b28).</p><p>(not a principle or maxim; it is a faculty, a power, a voice)</p><p>Mar 24</p><p>Ethics employs practical reasoning, not demonstrative or technical reasoning.</p><p>Aristotle‚Äôs identification of practical reason as a distinct sort of
reasoning should be contrasted with attempts to conflate distinctively
ethical reasoning with either demonstrative or technological reason-
ing. One might argue that modern accounts of ethical reasoning
presuppose one or the other of these identifications. Indeed, it is
commonly supposed today that there is something suspicious or
defective about commonsense ethical reasoning ‚Äì that ethics is not
yet on solid ground; that it has not found a scientific basis; and that
ethical reasoning will not become set on solid ground, until we come
to see how reasoning in ethics is similar to that of a deductive system
or a branch of technology. The two chief approaches to ethical
reasoning today are ‚Äò‚Äòdeontology‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äòconsequentialism‚Äô‚Äô: but deonto-
logical systems typically present ethical reasoning as a deductive
system; and consequentialism is evidently modeled on technological
science. Aristotle‚Äôs demarcation of a distinct virtue of phronesis is
effectively the claim that neither of these alternatives could quite be
correct</p><p>Thus, although for Aristotle there are a multiplicity of
sciences, and different branches of knowledge, there is a single sort of
knowledge which encompasses and unifies all the others. Thus, as he
sees it, there would correspondingly be a chief virtue of the part of the
soul that grasps unchanging things, a single virtue which, as it were,
encompasses and contains all the other virtues that are kinds of
knowledge. This is wisdom, as Aristotle understands it</p><p>If the non-rational part is not properly adjusted by phronesis, then it will have a profound negative impact on your wisdom. Phronesis is the precondition to wisdom because Phronesis is the necessary thing to put your non-rational part of the soul in order so that you can have wisdom.</p><p>Administrative ability (phronesis): a state of the thinking part of the
 ÃÑ
soul which makes someone actively and reliably disposed to attain
truth in action as regards things ultimately good and bad for
human beings, precisely through reasoning (1140b5‚Äì6).</p><p>emphasis on good for human beings</p><p>Wisdom (sophia): insight and knowledge as regards those sorts of
things that are best by nature (1141a19‚Äì20, b3).</p><p>best, regardless of species, truly, unqualified best, period.</p><p>Phronesis therefore attains qualified truth in practical reasoning, truth which is relative to a species;
but wisdom, in contrast, attains truth (full stop).</p><p>To me: there is a difference between saying that one might 'implicitly' believe or 'have a gut feeling' that one should do X in circumstance Y. The inarticulacy of the virtuous agent is fine with me. That is a practical matter. I disagree that there isn't at least a theoretical truth. </p><p>Pg 187 -Aristotle - pg 228 Pakaluk</p><p>dministrative ability aims at wisdom and orders everything
else so as to promote the acquisition and actualization of wisdom:
‚Äò‚ÄòAdministrative ability does not employ wisdom as an instrument;
rather, it looks to how wisdom might come into existence. It gives orders
then, for the sake of that; it does not give orders to that‚Äô‚Äô (1145a7‚Äì9)</p><p>Phronesis exists for the sake of wisdom, but it doesn't command wisdom.</p><p>Wisdom and phronesis
 ÃÑ
both make it so that a human being carries out his characteristic work
well and achieves happiness. Wisdom produces happiness, not as
something distinct from it, in the way that medical skill produces
health, but in the way that health produces health (1144a3‚Äì5): it is
constitutive of happiness.</p><p>Mar 29</p><p>Eudaimonia: stable, objective, universal, a relationship to divinity
Eudaimonia: ultimate, self-sufficient, preferable</p><p>The debate continues between selection and collection.</p><p>Selection- one single thing</p><p>Collection - group fo things</p><p>The structure of the soul (just considering 2 of 3 parts), has reason and the desire (non-rational). The exercise of man is the highest activity. God contemplates (and exercises reason). Character related virtues correspond to non-rational part. </p><p>Teresa/Hawking Problem- it would appear that mother teresa has the proper character-related virtues, but lacks the thinking related virtues. And, Hawking appears to have the latter but not the former. Aristotle's applauds what Hawkings does, but that does mean that Aristotle won't applaud Teresa (she's not a good human) for not being a cosmologist? And, does Hawking's lack of character-related virtue mean demonstrate he isn't good?</p><p>WHat is best for a human?</p><p>If it requires a combination of character and highest activity of reason, then it seems like the collection view is what we seek.
If the ultimate goal is the highest activity of reason, then it seems selection. Virtue isn't an end in itself though, it doesn't seem self-sufficient. </p><p>‚ÄòIf happiness is
activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable that it be activity in
accordance with the best virtue‚Äô‚Äô (1177a12‚Äì13). This is puzzling,
because Aristotle, as we have seen, has throughout the Ethics been
deliberately maintaining a kind of indecision as regards what we have
called Selection and Collection. Happiness is activity in accordance
with virtue ‚Äì granted ‚Äì but is it some single such activity (Selection)
or all such activities (Collection)?</p><p>Yet another puzzling aspect of the passage is its use, for the first
time, of the phrase ‚Äò‚Äòultimate happiness‚Äô‚Äô (teleia eudaimonia; see also
1177b24). </p><p>How can happiness come in degrees? If it is self-sufficient, we might be tempted to think that there aren't degrees of happiness.</p><p>So both sorts of happi-
ness are fragments, really: ‚Äò‚Äòultimate‚Äô‚Äô happiness is a fragment of
virtuous activity, and happiness ‚Äò‚Äòin a secondary sense‚Äô‚Äô is a comple-
mentary fragment. Neither of them is complete: so how can either
constitute happiness?</p><p>Mar 31</p><p>The life of pleasure-</p><p>The life of virtue-</p><p>The contemplative life-</p><p>There are serious objections to the claim that the life of virtue is a precondition to the the life of contemplation.</p><p>Happiness must be self-sufficient, complete, etc. And, it is found, it seems, in the contemplative life.</p><p>pg319-standard interpretation</p><p>3 problems in standard view, quotes of start:</p><p>...?</p><p>There is a difficulty, too, in taking 10.8 to be marking out a ‚Äò‚Äòlife of
political involvement‚Äô‚Äô which putatively involves administrative vir-
tue and character-related virtues alone. </p><p>Again, just as it is odd, on Aristotle‚Äôs scheme, to think of adminis-
trative virtue as embedded in a way of life without its having any
‚Äò‚Äòtarget,‚Äô‚Äô so it is odd to consider philosophical wisdom as pursued
within a way of life in separation from administrative virtue.</p><p>The maximization of contemplative
activity, Aristotle thinks, is therefore subject to the constraint that
it can be maximized only through actions that are consistent with the
various virtues.</p><p>But then why count activity in accordance with character-related
virtues as happiness at all? Why not say that only philosophical
contemplation is happiness, especially given that Aristotle holds
that happiness extends only so far as theoretical activity (1178b28)?
What is the difference if one maintains that there is only one activity
that is happiness, but that there are also other sorts of activities which,
although not happiness, nonetheless are similar to happiness?</p></div>
