<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today we took a test on Oxy-fuel cutting. It was a long chapter. It wasn't too bad though. I thought we'd be moving straight into socket welds. Nope. Wrong again. /sad-face. The teacher decided to have us go back to laterals. This time we did a giant pipe, 4-on-10 lateral. I honestly didn't do much besides the math, planning, and drawing on the material. Nash and Chris wanted to do the cutting and grinding. Alright (I wish I could just do it all; I enjoy it). I did the finishing touches on the bevel (although, it is unclear to me why we beveled in this section other than the possibility that we are reinforcing it?) because Nash doesn't quite have it down. One interesting part of the planning was that we use schedule 40 for the branch pipe after having decided not to use the much thicker schedule 80. I checked the bottom pipe (the trunk?) and found it was schedule 20. The teacher confirmed. It didn't interfere with our measurements though (or, I hope it won't). Remember that Outer Diameter is the nominal size after 12 inches, but Inner diameter up to 12 inches.</p><p>I also helped Ferguson a bit on his socket weld project as I wandered around waiting for Nash to get through it. He lacks both an understanding of where to grind and finesse with the grinder.</p><p>I then hammered marks on the soapstone rings I drew with Chris into the large pipe. We are fabricating a reinforcement ring for this lateral out of the part of the large pipe. Remember that the width (not thickness) of reinforcement rings are 1/2 of the branch pipe diameter. To make this ring, we need to cut it very cleanly. Thus, we had the chance to put our theory into practice by using the oxy-fuel cutting torch today. The teacher was slightly miffed that I was working ahead (instead of getting him, but he was quite busy), but my work was fine (slightly tighter than he'd have liked on the inner circle). Anyways, we got it set, and so I went to get him this time. I told him we were ready to cut. The teacher said, &quot;go for it.&quot; Lulz. Well, I've done it a few times, so fine. I taught the guys how to use it (I think the teacher should have taught them to use this very dangerous machine, not me). </p><p>They were scared as fuck. Shaking. Nash has an admitted phobia about it even. He wouldn't even cut except the first time. I understand being scared of it. This thing is really fucking dangerous. Anyways, I taught 'em on some practice pipe to try it out. I then cut the center piece out of our primary piece, since it needed to be the most exact of the cuts (I did an okay job; the problem was that I had to freehand one section). Also, don't forget to make yourself comfortable! Think of it as welding, but way more dangerous. Be comfortable. Maximize your fine-grained control. It didn't help that we were basically on a timer because we were running low on oxygen. Afterward, Chris cut the outer loop. It needs some grind work. I'll jump on it asap tomorrow. Afterward, I guess we'll tack. I'd love to take a shot at welding the damn thing. Might as well though, right? If this is just practice, it's the perfect time to screw it all up (because, in a sense, it doesn't matter if I mess up). </p><p>On a sadder note, Connor finished his work today. He has graduated. He left, for good it seems. I said goodbye and wished him luck in life. </p></div>
