<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Orin and Joelle's relationship somehow is a natural match. The addiction of desire satisfaction in general isn't going anywhere. This is Schopenhauer crying out. The Dark Triadic notions sing loud and clear.</p><p>I feel incredibly lucky to not have experienced physical withdrawal symptoms like Tony. This is harsh. You know, this book reminds me of <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>. It's hyperreal about it.</p><p>Symptoms themselves developing symptoms...darkness within darkness...is poetic.</p><p>The description of the phenomenology of this withdrawal is haunting. It's hell. The need to rely upon other drugs to deal with others reminds me of how lies or debts pile up against each other, spiraling out of or into control. The seizures sound insane.</p><p>-=][ Rabbitholed ][=-</p><p>&quot;The Personal is the Political is the pathological&quot; is a fascinating phrase. This teenager saw much further than I ever did at that age. I'm feeling pretty stupid.</p><p>The anti-ONAN terrorism considerations are hyperreal. It's not real at all.</p><p>Mario's birth is visceral and heart-breaking. He has such a fascinating life compared to the rest of his family. He lives a very human life in an odd way. It is as though he is the most physically damaged but the least mentally damaged. Hal can see it very clearly.</p><p>Cameras, video, and film are just the profound semiotic format of this world. All the characters are wrapped up in these kinds of representations of themselves and the world.</p><p>The mind-destroying meme-drug of the weapon Infinite Jest video seems to be the leech sublator of our minds.</p><p>Eschaton is an interesting name for a complex game, well-suited to the weapon in question and perhaps the book overall. Also:</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://pooryorickentertainment.tumblr.com/post/7792492668" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://pooryorickentertainment.tumblr.com/post/7792492668</a></p><p>I adore the unique terminology; that's very much what complex games do...build new languages. This game is a fascinating representation. Virtual reality shows up. This is a microcosm, training, and an experience machine which seems to have serious cross-over into reality.</p><p>I don't see why I should care about Pemulis. In fact, I'm not sure I understand the nature of this drug-game, why it matters to me personally, etc. I suggest, however, that I probably have many such examples in my own life.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Empathy is called identification.
</p></blockquote><p>Empirical investigations in AA's effectiveness demonstrate something the author does not point out. It does explain some of what's fucked up about the program. The higher power discussion is hilarious.</p></div>
