<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I learned how to use the scientific calculator for reals this time. I adore it. I can see what I need to memorize now. I still do my math twice. It's an extra 5 minutes, but it limits a lot of risks. </p><p>I obsessively check measurements at opportune moments in my build process so I feel confident when I get to building. I'm very organized, and I have a process that I can analyze, enrich, and improve upon. I am building my work-stack (or one of them). I am very fast (and safe), and I think I can continue to ramp it up. </p><p>My teacher gave us a schematic which we did as a math problem before. I have everything saved in my skein notebook. Nobody has actually built this thing in class. Of course, since we've been crushing it, he's throwing us curveballs and possible busywork. He's giving us work he hasn't given anyone else. I suspect this is because he needs to look like he is doing something. My teacher is clearly an alcoholic (but I still respect him, shaky hands and all; he has led an interesting life), he yells at the guys a lot (very emotional, not terribly rational...but never at me [he's far more formal and polite with me; I must think carefully about how I would react if people yelled at me {defusion is not necessarily the best answer, but it sometimes is best}]), and he is not deeply concerned about his students(although still  partially concerned, even if only for redpilled honest shopkeeper kinds of reasons and appearances for keeping his job). I am slowly trying to unspokenly or less-spoken convince him to advance me at the pace I deserve (perhaps separate from Nash, or with additional unique content, but at least at a fast pace) to move at and to show me everything he knows; we may have different definitions of what counts as this. It seems to me that I have regularly had to make him think (I have watched carefully); but, I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p>I'm trying to develop a basic relationship with him, but I also show the respect of students to teachers (regardless of the merit of such a practice, I still want to show that I'm paying attention, listening, and want to know what he knows). I keep it professionally jovial with him and show him I'm serious. I work my ass off in that class, and he sees it every time he walks into the shop (because he's often screwing around and missing from the classroom [every student has complained about this, and they are not wrong], taking up side jobs, etc.) in. I rarely take my full breaks; I don't chit chat; I don't play games; I take initiative and study between downtime; I'm consistently looking to improve and become virtuous at this practice. I do not waste my time like the other students because I need this education to get the best paying job I can, and I need my excellence to shine and open doors for me. I need to learn this really well, I need him to be the best teacher he can be (whether that means removing barriers or helping him understand what that is for this context), and I need his drunken recommendation. </p><p>I complete ~1 project a day (projects appear to take 2-3 days for good students, and a week or more for bad), and I have passed every test he's thrown at me (even the optional ones). It is not obvious that Nash is actually passing these tests; I seem to be doing a lot of the work for us (I suspect my teacher knows this). Nash is too content to chillax when this is clearly his chance to dive in. Working with Nash has been difficult, and it showed strongly on this project. He is simply not as adept at this (only because he doesn't try: this kid is smart enough and has enough background that this could be much easier for him). He can't do the math, he mismeasures all the time, he doesn't tighten his work (which is awful for us because it means that it is moving around and very frustrating to level), he is terrible at understanding where he should be placing his wrenches (including which direction, how much force, and even why he is doing it), he can't see the right build order, and more. I do my best to help him, especially since I realize that I may not be able to move forward unless he is at least getting it decently enough that my teacher will not feel compelled to slow me down. </p><p>Yesterday, he threw the chuck for the threader so hard (repeatedly) that it adjusted the diameter of the die set. Despite checking with a spare fitting for turns at random times, we didn't figure out that he had done this until too late. Many of our pipes weren't threaded deeply enough because of it. We found out the hard way, and we didn't find out until the end of the day. It is obvious that Nash is frustrated working on these things and working with me (his failures really cost us now, and even when I don't say anything, I seem to wear my inferences and beliefs on my face so plainly to others at times and in certain ways). I ended up having to redo the work today (rethreading already threaded pipe), taping again (we run through it quickly, especially with mistakes like these, and our teacher has complained about how much we use [although, we complete a lot of work]), and then building the entire thing by myself (in less time than Nash and I had to spend the day before). I was actually proud of what I did this time. It was clearly meant to be tricky, and I did a good job.</p><p>This curveball yesterday was obviously a curveball for even my teacher. He could not rotate the isometric schematic and my fabricated object in his head well enough to see they matched. He had to run to his office to build a model of the schematic out of wire (I believe he was suggesting to me that he was embarrassed about it later after he was done checking my work). He figured out I did it correctly (but not before making us unnecessarily rotate the heavy bastard off our table). Everything was good, and I felt confident it would be (it's nice to have confidence in the face of tests). I hope to continue to work hard, learn, do well, and feel confident.</p><p>Sometimes I feel compelled to make suggestions to him about what I want to learn. I'm straight up eager to learn and master this art. I do not want to waste an ounce of my schooling (I've had 10 years of post-secondary education already, and I appreciate that maxim: you get out what you put in). Does he know he has a Formula 1 racecar for a student? Is it my fault here? Is it out of my control? I can only do my best (be rational) with a good attitude (empathy).</p><p>He measured the pipebender (which has never been used, and he has to find the manual for). I might get to practice that. Even an introduction would be useful.</p><p>He is likely going to have us make things on the simulator (no one has done this for a while, but we will get to). I'm excited since I'll actually have used Flanges instead of merely installing them on the ends of my fabricated objects. The simulator is unimpressive looking, and it is only a screwpipe simulator (perhaps that's all we really need one for since welding does the rest). I'm hoping that I will get to design the schematics we use on the simulator. I want it to say something. What should it say? What will I draw with these pipes? I drew some cool ones before (and made two of them; I liked the spiral the most [it looked cool]). This is a different challenge. I should measure and plan, draw and present it to him.</p><p>He said that in a week or week and a half, he wants to let me start beveling and butt welding (tack welding only, but I want to learn the beadwork too). This is normally late first trimester or early second-trimester work. I would really like to have a strong introduction to welding in this class, while I have the chance with the materials, machines, time, and teachers. </p><p>I see mistakes everywhere. Finding mistakes in myself is what makes me good at things. It also makes me not like people (and vice versa). I am probably an extrovert who tests strongly as an INTJ simply because I'm misanthropic (I usually love, but rarely like). The fact is: I am a loner. I do infinitely better when I only have to analyze for me and not for and especially with a group of people. It's why I'm not a good team player (still wildly better than average, but my giftedness does not shine in a group). If I have to group, I will. Sometimes I even enjoy it. I find I'm often happier in video games when I'm by myself or working closely with a couple people. The more the not merrier. Basically, I'm saying that I'm a bad empathizer. I don't think it's my fault as an autistic person either. I try to empathize as best as I can, but it often isn't good enough. There are only so many things in my control. If I only have so many resources I can devote to empathizing (it is emotionally draining for me in a way that it isn't for others, I suspect), I want to make sure it is on my family; we need it. I need to be there for us as best as I can. That means I need to be wise in how I spend my social-energy. I can see why businessmen often have such low empathy (there seem to be a variety of causes and possibilities). I will be respectful and kind, but I will make sure that I guide myself to opportunities to have maximal alone time (on something fun) with as minimal sacrifices to pay (including my enslavement) as is worth it. Do the utilitarian math, or get the right feel for it, h0p3!</p></div>
