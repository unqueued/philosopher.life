WED 3:43 PM
How goes it?
THU 9:53 AM
Hey [[h0p3]]! Sorry I missed your message yesterday. It goes... well?
THU 11:32 AM
Work has been crazy busy, moreso than usual, to the point where it feels like our entire department is drowning. .‚Äî.
THU 11:33 AM
And we have a teammate leaving today. Big oof.
THU 11:34 AM
You have been swamped.
THU 11:34 AM
How many hours a day you putting in?
THU 11:34 AM
Trying my best to stick to the standard, but 9-6 is becoming the norm lately
THU 11:37 AM
Drowning it is. =(
THU 11:38 AM
Hopefully it doesn't move to 12 hours a day
THU 11:38 AM
Sometimes forgetting to take lunch breaks too, which I am now realizing does not help.
THU 11:39 AM
BUT
THU 11:39 AM
Leadership has been very understanding and is more rallying with us than against us truthfully.
THU 11:39 AM
So that‚Äôs helpful.
THU 11:39 AM
What happens if you head back to 40?
THU 11:42 AM
I was under the impression that after the rough season at the end of last year it was going to smooth out.
THU 11:42 AM
Are you concerned about losing your job in the turmoil?
THU 11:42 AM
It has calmed down somewhat, there is overall less stress, but my responsibilities are piling up which makes it more difficult to handle it all. But no, I have no concerns about losing my job as I am now essentially the head of communications for my department and have made myself essential by streamlining the process more than anyone else thus far. Muahahaaaaa.
THU 11:50 AM
I am working towards pulling back to 40 by proactively preparing more it‚Äôs just taking time to flatten out.
THU 11:51 AM
Also, what I thinks that‚Äôs helped me more this time around is my friends and family have been incredible supportive (you included). I actually had a ‚Äúcome to Jesus‚Äù moment with a friend that I‚Äôd had a falling out with awhile ago and it‚Äôs brought a lot of joy to my life.
THU 11:52 AM
Aye. I can see you are taking a leadership position.
THU 11:55 AM
I'm glad to hear you have that support and the joy of resolution! =)
THU 11:57 AM
Honestly [[h0p3]]... I‚Äôve realized that I have a very hard time walking away from something when I KNOW I can make it better if I put forth true effort. Even though this may not be my ‚Äúdream job‚Äù and Humana‚Äôs line of work in and of itself may even be morally questionable, it is a job that I need and I AM in the position to correct some of what they do here. I would beat myself up endlessly if I left without really trying my best to make things better. So I have decided to work at it my hardest for the next year, and if I truly can‚Äôt get anywhere then I will leave.
THU 12:06 PM
In all honesty, I cannot say I have worked my absolute hardest this past year. I really struggled with having little-to-no motivation because it felt like my work was getting shoved to the side. But I am determined to make a difference now. I‚Äôm aiming high and pushing to make my voice heard (in the appropriate ways of course).
THU 12:08 PM
And I think that motivation is already starting to pay off significantly. Shit is getting done, despite the insanity.
THU 12:08 PM
What you up to this weekend?
