<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Collaborating with people is always difficult, especially for misanthropes like me. In an increasingly interconnected world, where tools pop-up, evolve and explode in weeks not years, it is obvious that immediate, pervasive, always-on, inescapable socializing is more than technically feasible. This radical change in how we interact with each other doesn't always make getting work done easier though. </p><p>As usual, technology is a two-edged sword. Communicating with people in real-time at all times for all things has serious logistical, emotional, and political drawbacks. The collapse of the distinction between work and personal/home-life is only further driven by this problematic. Essentially, there are serious diminishing returns to symmetric and synchronized collaboration tools and environments for productivity and especially happiness.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button></p><p>Ultimately, I get my best work done when I isolate myself. To some extent, we must disconnect from others as a means to doing our work. I think, more-or-less, everyone finds themselves in these contexts where they must disconnect in order to deeply dive into the problem they face. </p><p>One must carve out pockets of time to get work done. We must make sure that we aren't constantly (and uselessly) paying the cost of connecting to people beyond some obviously necessary threshold.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> There's definitely a ton of low-hanging fruit to pick. Beyond that, however, we need reasons to herd ourselves. Group work really does have its limits. Too many tasks require that we don't collaborate. We must rely upon more asymmetric and asynchronous collaboration tools to succeed, and when we can't, we need very good reasons.</p><p>For many of us, we must push back against the technosocialization tide in order to accomplish our goals. I don't mean this in a ludditic sense. I mean that we must fight for private spaces, for our alone time, and for environments which allow us to lose ourselves in our work without the constant interruptions and distractions of trendy HR-fucktarded collaboration schemes. You'll still collaborate. Believe you me. Do it wisely though.</p><p>My conjecture is that we will continue to see the evolution of humans (incredible pressures) to integrate this exponential increase in socializing in every corner of our lives. The outgoing sort will continue to be the norm, and only those who can endure or thrive while being permanently wired to each other will survive, with one exception: those with significant competitive advantages developed through effective isolation for getting significant portions of their work done alone. We will always be connected. It's about finding the golden mean. Be connected in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> And, of course, productivity and happiness are often incompatible.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> Obviously, communicating is crucial.</sub></p></div>
