<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Intro</h2><p>Huge fan of Lessig. I'm glad to see the high praise for Stallman. I'm not surprised.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 1: The GNU Project</h2><p>God damn do I respect Stallman. He's also a complete fucking badass for building GCC. He really did start from scratch. </p><p>I appreciate the legal incentivization of GPL, but I am so completely against IP that I can't bring myself to do it. It is here that I part with Stallman. He actually believes in IP rights to some extent. I do not.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 2: The GNU Manifesto</h2><p>He's a prophet who changed the world. I am deeply indebted to this man.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 3: Free Software Definition</h2><p>The &quot;free as in&quot; phrasing is lovely and simple. I don't think it captures the philosophical nuance in the end. Stallman is more of a computer scientist than a philosopher. Insofar as he engages in philosophy, he is brief and quite practical. He spends a lot of time shaping the Free Software image.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 4: Why Software Should Not Have Owners</h2><p>Solid arguments. Nothing traced back to the origins of these concepts, but that's okay. I'm afraid to say there is also more rhetoric than I would like in it.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 5: What‚Äôs in a Name?</h2><p>I too am deeply disturbed by the attempt to wrestle free software out of political notions and strictly into commercial settings. It's disgusting. I cannot respect Linus for this reason. It is GNU/Linux, and unfortunately, I almost never say it. It's definitely implied in my writing and thoughts, but I'm not overt about it. Perhaps I should be. When I go to describe what Linux really is I always go back to GNU and GPL as the ecosystem of humans and their creations.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 6: Why ‚ÄúFree Software‚Äù is Better than ‚ÄúOpen Source‚Äù</h2><p>I'm embarrassed to say I've never read these works (only excerpts). Preaching to the choir! Unfortunately, I've had to learn many of these arguments the hard way. I wish I had read them from the beginning.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 7: Releasing Free Software if You Work at a University</h2><p>I have much stronger words for universities, but I think I have more radical approaches to intellectual property, economics, and education than Stallman publicly presents.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 8: Selling Free Software</h2><p>Here is where I am not so sure. I want to agree to it by and large. I'm quite concerned about capitalist infections, especially in this space. I'd prefer a hedged conservative approach that errs on the side of caution, of radically making sure it's free. But, of course, I'm a pirate.</p><h2 class="">Chapter 9: Free Software Needs Free Documentation</h2><p>Preach, yo! Information must be free! I am deeply indebted to software communities whose best documentation is the free kind. </p><h2 class="">Chapter 10: Free Software Song</h2><p>Played it on the piano. Uh, no thank you. This should not be in the collection of essays.</p><p>Alright, I'm done. I've skimmed the rest. It says nothing I didn't already believe. This book is confirmation bias or lacking the radicality I support.</p></div>
