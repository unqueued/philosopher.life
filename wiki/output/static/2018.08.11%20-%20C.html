<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>He called me from the beach he hopes to move to in a couple years. Retirement is not going well, and his tempjob is sucking the life out of him. He sounds very much unhappy with life, and I feel bad for him. I'm bad at communicating that fact effectively enough to him.</p><p>He probably said he loved me unconditionally about 20 times. He said he understood me. He claims to have read my wiki, but could not address it. He made a lot of tall promises. He really wanted me to throw reason away and listen to his affective influence. Clearly, he thinks what I'm doing is stupid. =/ - I can't help him there. He can read and debate directly with me about the stupidity in writing from now on.</p><p>He continually explicitly contradicted (straight up P and ~P, literally) himself throughout the conversation (a common problem with him over the past ~13 years I've known him) and also repeated himself like a broken record (huge dark-triad redflags). Several moves he said were profoundly illogical (and bear close inspection). It was a very Straussian moment. It is interesting for an autist to build a relation with a schizophrenic. I love the man, even though we disagree in a profound way across the Bayesian bridge. </p><p>I think he is gently trying to say he is not interested in my wiki. He claimed he could only get to know me by taking a walk with me. He had no argument for the claim other than a feeling. Actually, overall, I think he disagrees with my beliefs and desires pretty radically (even when we have quite a bit in common). In a sense, it's okay that we disagree because we have no other choices to some non-trivial extent. Of course, even in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> on the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Litmus%2520Test.html">Wiki Litmus Test</a>, I am willing to accept what minimal cooperation can arise from not engaging in our disagreements with each other at this level. Admittedly, not much of a relationship can be built if we can't engage in each other's writing. </p><p>He said he felt bad that he wasn't able to call me back quickly enough. I told him not to worry about it. It sounded like he wasn't sure about us meeting in person either, for logistical reasons. I told him not to worry about it, and we will see each other when we can.</p><p>I think we both desperately wanted the other to know we loved one another. We felt distant, and we did not want to be. I admire that about him. </p><p>It felt like hospitality negotiation in the desert. I enjoy having the chance to be so open with him, as gently as I can. I do not wish to be a dick to this man, and I go out of my way not to contradict his faulty reasoning as far as I charitably can. It leaves us little space to discuss what matters, but I appreciate that he even wants to try (recognizing the difference between us as nomads is huge in a number of regards). I hear hospitality and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> there, and I hope I did a good job of conveying the desire for peace, cooperation, trust, and love built on the best foundations we can muster together.</p><p>If all we get to have is a shallow relationship, then I will continue it. Obviously, I hope for more. Regardless, I will treat The Other here, different language/perception/model though he may have, as empathically as I can.</p><p>Love can exist even with minimal trust and respect. I will do my best, sir!</p></div>
