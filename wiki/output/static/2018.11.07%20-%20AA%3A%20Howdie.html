WED 12:31 PM
Hey =)
WED 3:01 PM
Nothing yet so far, sadly =(
WED 3:02 PM
That's okay. I'm still just applying.
WED 3:02 PM
How's your day going?
WED 3:02 PM
The wheels sometimes turn slowly :confused:
WED 3:02 PM
Yeah, lol.
WED 3:02 PM
My day has been ok ‚Äîwifi at the school was up and down but other that that it was a pretty good day
WED 3:03 PM
My son's computer upstairs doesn't get a good connection, so we're trying to find a good option for him.
WED 3:05 PM
Students get to use wifi too?
WED 3:05 PM
They have two sets of chromebooks that are on wifi for the students but otherwise no they aren‚Äôt supposed to be (though many of them probably are)
WED 3:06 PM
slick rascals
WED 3:07 PM
Yep ‚Äîusually starts with the staff kids and then spreads to the others
WED 3:07 PM
It is what it is :slightly_smiling_face:
WED 3:08 PM
They don't think it be like it is, but it do.
WED 3:08 PM
Yerp
WED 3:09 PM
So is [[UJ]] the principle now? =)
WED 3:10 PM
principal *
WED 3:10 PM
I don‚Äôt mind the wifi down except that my phone doesn‚Äôt work well ‚Äîbut when the network is down bleh
WED 3:10 PM
What's your carrier?
WED 3:10 PM
No not yet ‚Äîhe has applied for different positions in and out of the county but hasn‚Äôt gotten many interviews even
WED 3:11 PM
Probably a ton of competition
WED 3:11 PM
Att ‚Äîbut its less the carrier than the fact the the school is a metal box and no one gets reception
WED 3:12 PM
Yeah ‚ÄîI think when he has his doctorate that will give him a push
WED 3:12 PM
He is working on his dissertation
WED 3:13 PM
Noice!
WED 3:13 PM
What's it on?
WED 3:13 PM
Teacher evaluation
WED 3:14 PM
(Also, aside: always thought a faraday cage restaurant might be cool...force people to stay off their phones. Probably a terrible idea though.)
WED 3:14 PM
Actually that does sound cool
WED 3:14 PM
I am guilty of too much phone
WED 3:14 PM
Apple just started a screen time app this last update‚Äîit is um very telling
WED 3:15 PM
I hear that. I'm lucky enough to be too incompetent on my phone to really use it except when I'm forced to. I &lt;3 muh monsters though.
WED 3:15 PM
Lol!
WED 3:15 PM
Hehe
WED 3:16 PM
I read on mine often and text but otherwise not much
WED 3:17 PM
So, what's he demonstrating or wrestling with about teacher evaluation?
WED 3:18 PM
I do a lot of audiobooks on the phone when I'm running errands.
WED 3:18 PM
He has put out surveys ‚Äîand if I understand correctly, it is the effectiveness of teacher evaluations (bias or unbias) He surveyed administrators and current teachers
WED 3:19 PM
I love audiobooks ‚Äî[[AG]] uses them a lot especially for school things. They are great for dyslexia
WED 3:20 PM
Heck yeah.
WED 3:20 PM
If you ever need audiobooks, let me know. I will get anything I can for you.
WED 3:20 PM
Don't know if you've ever heard Amazon's text-to-speech, but it's ridiculously lifelike to my ears.
WED 3:21 PM
last year they read Treasure Island and she listened to it while she read. Her teacher said she understood it better than most of her class
WED 3:21 PM
This year is the Scarlet Pimpernel
WED 3:22 PM
Oh good‚ÄîI will let you know
WED 3:22 PM
Googling, I don't know that one.
WED 3:22 PM
It is an adventure of sorts
WED 3:23 PM
I use Resilio Sync to transfer files between my devices and share with others. Here is a read+write key for you: REDACTED
WED 3:27 PM
Awesome I will get that
WED 3:29 PM
Thank you
WED 3:29 PM
I am going to catch a quick nap before I am off to the bookstore!
WED 3:30 PM
have fun! =)
WED 3:30 PM
The house is cold ‚Äîperfect for napping
WED 3:30 PM
Me and my 50 cats
WED 3:31 PM
Ok so there are just 5 but if anything ever happens to [[UJ]], you will be referring to me as the Cat Lady...more than I already am :slightly_smiling_face:
WED 3:32 PM
Lol.
WED 3:32 PM
If and when we have a house, I suspect [[k0sh3k]] will be aiming for that as well.
WED 3:32 PM
I even have one named Leroy Jenkins! He is my snuggle buddy.
WED 3:33 PM
Ranga, our oldest cat, prefers to stay outside. He has stopped liking [[k0sh3k]] (though, he likes the rest of us?). Chairman Meow is the cat that lives in [[k0sh3k]]'s lap and sleeps on her head at night.
WED 3:34 PM
Awww Leroy does that too. So does Crumbles though
WED 3:35 PM
There are many nights I wake up with 4 of the five cats on me
WED 3:35 PM
That must be excellent. They don't lay on me anymore, though they did as kittens. Meow likes to lick my armpit? Also, audiobook of Baroness Orczy - The Scarlet Pimpernel (Unabridged) is in our sync.</code></pre></div>
