<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What advice would you give a new student?</h2><p>Student of what? What is the purpose of this advice? Presumably, my goal is to help them succeed in their practice. But, what if I think their practice is immoral? Alasdair MacIntyre shows us the moral non-realism of Virtue theory. My advice, of course, would need to fit the student, the practice, and the context, among other things. Am I being asked to give generalized advice? Am I assuming I want the student to succeed, and am I to assume success simply counts as what everyone generally considers to be virtue of the practice?</p><p>I used to teach. Hell, I still do, but I don't get paid for it. I teach the other students in my class. I teach myself. I teach my children. I give advice all the time to students. Here goes:</p><ul><li>Do your best.</li><li>Work smarter not harder, but still work crazy fucking hard (just not at the expense of efficiency, effectiveness, etc.). Give 110% (Bobby Hill).</li><li>Have a good attitude.</li><li>Do not give up. Don't quit. Persist! Be relentless.</li><li>Empathize with your future self; know thyself; know why you are a student.</li><li>Focus.</li><li>Understand the theory, and grind it in practice/application.</li><li>Practice correctly. For the love of God, practice correctly!</li><li>Be creatively programmatic. Design and follow gameplans. Develop habits which make you virtuous at the practice.</li><li>Understand your goals, find the means to them; break large problems into manageable smaller ones, etc.</li><li>Listen to experts.</li><li>Be insatiable in your pursuit of wisdom and knowledge.</li><li>Be meta.</li><li>Understand the meaning and purpose of what you are doing. Understand the value of your practice.</li><li>Be humble, honest, open to change, willing to fall and stand back up, etc.</li><li>Explore the landscape of your practice.</li><li>Find your niche, develop a competitive advantage, but don't simply work on those things which are easy for you.</li><li>Learn the fundamentals like the back of your hand. Master them.</li><li>Appreciate crossover, hybridization, and interdisciplinary aspects of your practice.</li><li>Perform your practice with moral integrity.</li><li>Maximize your utility.</li><li>Be rational; be empathic.</li><li>Do as the virtuous agent would do, feel as they would, think as they do, be as they would aim for the golden mean, etc.</li></ul><p>See, this shit just boils down to the kind of advice we have to give ourselves as students of life. I generalize to the point of absurdity; it's like some shitty self-help list. Ultimately, I need more context to answer the question. I have tons of thoughts about how to learn various subjects, how and what to learn at different ages, and which subjects are worth pursuing and why. I can't just write you a one-size-fits-all answer. The world of learning is simply too broad.</p><p>I fear you think I'm literally throwing your question away. But, specificity really is key here. </p><p>Ah, but the answer is obviously not as clear I made it sound either. All too often, moral luck and at least a strong disregard for the opinions, feelings, or thoughts of others form another basis of successful students.</p><ul><li>Be born in the right circumstances.</li><li>Be wealthy.</li><li>Be attractive.</li><li>Don't be unattractive and poor.</li><li>Be intelligent, and if you can, be clever.</li><li>Do not respect authority except yourself (that doesn't mean you don't appear to respect authority). </li><li>Appearances tends to matter more than substance.</li><li>My <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Common%2520Sense.html">Common Sense</a> page is invaluable to you.</li><li>Cheat where applicable. Be sure to abuse summaries and shortcuts. Find the easiest, laziest way to defeat the system in front of you.</li></ul><p>Ah, my student, success is an ugly thing all too often. My advice will have many contradictions in it. Unfortunately, success itself has too many contradictory definitions and contexts.</p><p>Give me the telos and context, and I'll try to come up with the means to your ends. Such a maxim, of course, hasn't been universalized. It is mere instrumental reasoning on its own. And, yet again, this house of cards of a question is reduced to absurdity.</p><p>Of course, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a> wage their battles over such fundamental questions. I am not unified enough to answer this question, not that any person I've ever met or read could answer it satisfactorily either. I legitimately wish there was a purgatory for me to talk to my philosopher kingods, at least as I've imagined them with my Straussian charity.</p><p>This reminds me, I need to take my DCK this weekend. I clearly need it.</p></div>
