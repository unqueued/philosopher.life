<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>At the risk of sounding like a &quot;coffee house intellectual&quot; moron, an epiphinaut, or someone trying to sound too deep, I'll share my thought for the day. Maybe I'm seeing too much into the issue, butÂ for now,Â I believe it is a worthy thought to consider.</p><p>Out of curiosity (and boredom), I chose to lookup the meaning of the &quot;4th dimension&quot;, specificallyÂ what a 4-dimensional object looks like and how it could be relevant to someone like me who tends to visualize 3-dimensionally. I found that it was a fairly odd, and maybe even not fully explored topic in my research. On one hand, the mathematicians look at it as a tool, simply something that is &quot;capable&quot; of being demonstrated, but the visualization not useful in itself–or rather, the mathematical implications (which I still don't understand) seemed more important than the visual applications. On the other hand, we have the spooky sci-fi freaks who probably make it out to be more than it is...But, after further consideration (or simply due to my own ignorance?) I can't help but wonder if there is more to this issue that I thought at first glance. I read even further about what a &quot;4th dimension&quot; visually implies, and it was astounding. So, I thought I'd make a quick note about it, simply because I thought it warranted discussion (even if only with myself).</p><p>At first, I didn't even know howto fully visualize a 4-d object (and, to be honest, I still struggle to think about it, probably because I'm so used to thinking in 3-d and seeing in 2-d). For me to understand 4D is like explaining 3D to a being which lives, breathes, and thinks in 2D. If I talked to a &quot;plane&quot;, how could I possibly describe the 3rd dimension (depth) to the 2D object or thinker? He has very little reference to work from, with the exception of understanding the changes in perspective from 0D to 1D to his 2D. Still, it is a very large gap for him to overcome to even begin to think in 3D, no? I think the same is for our case when attempting to &quot;visualize&quot; 4D in a 3D mindset. What is really funny is the learning I've done so far in regards to +dimensions, the 4th and so on, have only be visually explained to me in 2D. It seems like it would be much, much easier to explain 4D to me in 3D than 4D to me in 2D, much like explaining 3D to a 2D thinker is best done in 2D rather than 1D or 0D. I would like to more fully grasp 4D. Perhaps when I happen across a math/science department they'll have a good 3D model/projection of 4D for me to observe (although, I assume it would be impossible to make a &quot;good&quot; representation of 4D in 3D, I assume it would atleast be better than the 2D projections).</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Dice_analogy-_1_to_5_dimensions.svg/400px-Dice_analogy-_1_to_5_dimensions.svg.png&amp;quot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Dice_analogy-_1_to_5_dimensions.svg/400px-Dice_analogy-_1_to_5_dimensions.svg.png&amp;quot</a>; /&gt;</p><p>This doesn't perfectly demonstrate the initial thoughts of 4D (or 5D), but it gives us a place to start. I decided to draw it myself just to better understand the picture. I like to think of dimensions as &quot;movement&quot; in some direction. In this case, I take a ready made object in the lower dimension, and then I 'move' all vectors of the lower dimensional object in the same direction (and 'length') and then recreate the lower dimension as a new projection, then I connect the corresponding vectors of the lower dimensional objects, and I've created a new dimension. Try it out! Point to Line segment to plane to Cube...and then you see the 4D cube. Here look at this, it is color coded (what I used to draw the 2nd time as well):</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Tesseract_net.svg/451px-Tesseract_net.svg.png&amp;quot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Tesseract_net.svg/451px-Tesseract_net.svg.png&amp;quot</a>; /&gt;</p><p>Just focus in on the object to the right, and you'll see how it works. This is a good start in the right direction (hehehe). But, unfortunately, I am just a 3-D guy who uses his retinas to reconfigure 2D images into 3D perceptions. Attempting to &quot;put myself&quot; in the picture to fully understand that 4D object is a daunting task. I have 2 other devices that help me right now (it only gets more complicated when you start using things other than cubes). The next useful projection is the &quot;net&quot; tesseract at the left of the above image. Imagine what other nets would look like to us:</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CubeNet_900.gif&amp;quot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CubeNet_900.gif&amp;quot</a>; /&gt;</p><p>This demonstrate 2D planes that are &quot;folded out&quot; to give us a better understanding of the meaning of a 3D cube. The 3D Net is a &quot;folded-out&quot; tesseract (4D cube).</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Tesseract2.svg/188px-Tesseract2.svg.png&amp;quot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Tesseract2.svg/188px-Tesseract2.svg.png&amp;quot</a>; /&gt;</p><p>This helps me to understand a basic principle about 4D: 4D naturally perceive things in 3D in the same why I naturally perceive things in 2D, and only through a mechanism like a &quot;retina&quot; could a 4D thinker reconfigure the multitude of 3D images into a 4D perception. More importantly, in the same way that depth perception (3D) is simply a miracle to someone who can only see in 2D, there is an extra type of depth perception, namely seeing 3D objects in their entirety (all at once) that would be miraculous to those of us with normal depth perception.</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Glass_tesseract_animation.gif&amp;quot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Glass_tesseract_animation.gif&amp;quot</a>; /&gt;
I like to think of it in terms of points. A 1D thinker can see (all at once) the infinite set of points along the line.Â  A 2D thinker will see a set of points on a plane, something that is infinity larger than the 1D thinker's Line. The important aspect of the 2D thinker is that he can perceive multiple lines rather than multiple points on a line. The 3D thinker, likewise, will see more than a plane's-roaming 2D thinker, and will see infinity X infinity X infinity (I like to think of X,Y, and Z on a graph in this respect). Again, the 3D think will see &quot;the whole&quot; of multiple planes, not just &quot;the whole&quot; of multiple lines like a 2D thinker. In this way, the 4D thinker would need to see &quot;the whole&quot; of multiple 3D objects. The 4D thinker's visual of 3D objects would definitely be analogous to a 3D thinker's visual of 2D objects.</p><p>Interesting things to think about. Consider that a 2DT (two dimensional thinker) will be unable to see a plane that moves back or forth (depth) even a few inches. It would appear the 2DT that a whole plane &quot;disappeared&quot; or became invisible. Would not such link between the 3DT and 4D exist? Are we not blind to it in the same way?</p><p>Lastly, if time is really the 4th dimension (which I still have trouble understanding at all), then would we not say that God perceives (if He does such a thing) at least 5-Dimensionally? Sounds stupid, I know. But, remember, things with depth are invisible and unintelligble to the 2DT, and likes things of the 4th Dimension are unintelligble to the 3DT. Assuming the 4th dimmension is time, and God is more powerful than time itself, then he must be 5-dimensional to see &quot;all the points&quot; of 4-D objects at once. And, if God is &quot;bound&quot; by time, and co-exists with it, then He might be 4D.</p><p>Or perhaps, we can go back to linear time thought, Kantian ideas of time being relative to movement, and just say that &quot;He Knows&quot; it...</p><p>But, cmon people!!! wouldn't a world so beautifully made, so perfectly scientific, be made by a Being that is also mathematically precise as well? Would it not make sense that there is a science and a method to this madness and not just &quot;oh yeah, He knows it...through omniscience&quot;. God is a creator, the Great Deducer, THE Scientist. If it can be known, then He knows it not just because He is omniscient, but also because He could DEDUCE it and because He can PERCEIVE the entirety of our world. He can see ALL POINTS at once. Be careful my Boethius-sympathizing friends...</p><p>As an additional note, at further consideration, it seems we are possibly 4D observers as we &quot;move&quot; through time. I don't know if that is geometrically equivalent or not...regardless, I think a case still might stand for arguing that God has -scientifically- better depth perception than we have, perhaps in the way ofÂ viewing the world through higher dimensions than we do.</p></div>
