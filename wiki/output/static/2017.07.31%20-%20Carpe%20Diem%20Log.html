<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><ul><li>Woke up right before the alarm, and I was tired as fuck.</li><li>I couldn't push out any bricks! Why, lord, why? I eat my vegetables!</li><li>Listened to the rest of the first episode of Malcolm Gladwell's <em>Revisionist History</em> podcast. It was outstanding.</li><li>I worked hard.</li><li>I spoke with my children during breaks and lunch.<ul><li>I think I should call my wife, but I really don't want to bother her.</li><li>I texted my wife and my brother JRE.</li></ul></li><li>I talked to my kids on the way back from work. I'm glad to have the chance to speak with them.</li><li>After work was...crazy. I was driving into my street, and there were cops pulling in everywhere. They weren't pulling me over, so I thought it was weird but acceptable. I wanted to get into my driveway. I noticed, however, that the cops started bunching there. They start yelling at me to run away, pulling their pistols and shotguns as they motioned and took cover behind their cars. A dozen cop cars eventually came as I tried to get out of the jam, and 2 helicopters circled overhead. The house directly across the street from mine was having a shootout with the cops.<ul><li>I decided to see if I could sit and wait it out as I talked to my son about it. No dice.</li><li>I went to a nearby Mexican restaurant. They had to find a waiter who could speak English. She was clearly annoyed with me the entire time. Stupid gringo, I guess?</li><li>My phone stopped working. Okay. </li><li>Authentic enchiladas, skirt steak, and black beans were the calming drug I needed. <ul><li>Take it back, got a &quot;Foh-tee&quot; and some cake for my birthday.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>I had a vid chat with my family.</li><li>I forgot my towel. /facepalm. I went to take a shower super late at night and noticed I forgot my towel.</li><li>A bit of League before bed.</li></ul></div>
