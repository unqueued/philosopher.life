In fact, I'm worried you're demonstrating that bias in your comment, as though you've already begged the question.</p><blockquote><p>Not to be rude, but what does rationalism mean to you?</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to you? Do you think it is identical with Reason itself? If so, why should we think this philosophy problem has been solved. As far as I can see, we're still trying to figure out how to respond to Kant in philosophy. I'm also open to the possibility that this community's explanation and justification for the &quot;correct&quot; epistemic standard might be radically incorrect in crucial respects and applications.</p><p>Ultimately, my epistemic goals, standards, or assumptions are perhaps not best described by what I consider to be an internet movement which calls itself Rationalist. My goal is to be a good philosopher, and I'm still trying to determine to what extent this sub's &quot;Rationalism&quot; hits the mark.</p><blockquote><p>To me, being willing to engage calmly and reasonably with people of different opinions is a big part of what being a rationalist is.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, you may be smuggling a great deal of content in that word &quot;reasonably.&quot; It's circular in saying &quot;being reasonable&quot; is a big part of being &quot;rationalist.&quot; This is an ancient problem, and I'm not holding you accountable to solving it. But, I hope you can see that in fact all conversations seem to require we hold a set of references and ideas in common. We have to agree upon some rules of engagement in the dialectic before we can begin.</p><p>Importantly, even epistemic disagreement between finite minds can be complex enough that we should be open to the possibility that we can't feasibly have both Leftists and Rightists fruitfully discussing anything except around the foundation/foundherentism.</p><p>I don't think the Right has to defend its justifications with as much force as the Left in this sub. A lot of groundwork is just handed to the Rightist. I'm not against that charity, but surely it's reasonable for the Leftist to pursue a place where much of the groundwork is also handed to them. This isn't to say the Right and Left shouldn't discuss their differences (far from it), but I think it's reasonable to have specialists discuss their views with other specialists as well (that goes for almost all disciplines). Whether intentional or not, this sub is a place for Right specialists. I don't see a problem with Leftists doing the same.</p><blockquote><p>If a community predetermines a particular set of views as the correct ones, to me that seems inherently anti-rationalist.</p></blockquote><p>My point to you is that in order to have any reasonable conversation at all requires the &quot;community predetermines a particular set of views [about epistemology and many other topics] as the correct ones&quot; to make further inferences. Surely you do not take yourself to be contradicting yourself. Even the Rationalist community makes predeterminations. Inescapably, one will have priors, innates, axioms, etc., although they can eventually lead one to spiral away and modify their axioms for coherence.</p><blockquote><p>I don't really see how your desired left rationalist community differs from a regular leftist community.</p></blockquote><p>It really may be the case that this sub has a charity problem, a bias, which prevents it from having the necessary ingredients for a fruitful conversation from and about Leftist perspectives. If this Right Rationalist community differs from a regular Right community, then I think we are forced to make room for the possibility that a Left Rationalist community could conceptually differ from a regular Leftist community.</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8wggdz/a_leftleaning_rationalist_subreddit/e1wi90o/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8wggdz/a_leftleaning_rationalist_subreddit/e1wi90o/</a></p><p>Thank you! Subbed.</p><p>/r/SneerClub also doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for either (although I'm still subbed to both it and SSC). Can you compare and contrast your sub to it?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I think that a majority of the active users on sneerclub are, frankly, bullies. That they tend to be left of this sub and make fun of people on those grounds is purely coincidental. I think if /r/slatestarcodex were dominated by the left, we would see the exact same users and behavior on sneerclub, but with less talk of politics and more talk of being autistic virgin robots. Needless to say, I'm not a huge fan of that type of person.</p><p>‚Äì /u/GCUPokeItWithAStick
</p></blockquote><p>That is well said. I've personally experienced that in sneerclub (even if anecdote isn't a good public reason). I very much hope your sub flourishes as you envision.</p><p>Finding good ways to incentivize people to take the risk of having the charity to engage in the Tit-for-Two-Tats strategy in iterated prisoner's dilemmas is not easy (to assume we really aren't engaged in perfect competition, enabling a forgiving cooperative strategy in handling miscommunications). The Golden Rule, especially when it costs us as individuals for the collective, is the spirit of the law of &quot;Leftism&quot; to me, and it's not easy to find others who agree and hope to use that as a final goal in our dialectics.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"></blockquote></div>
