1 HR AGO
Hey [[h0p3]]!
1 HR AGO
Hey [[L]]!
1 HR AGO
My week went by pretty quickly honestly. And nah, not tonight. That was a one time thing. Also, we got a bunch of snow and ice dumped on us last night so [[K]] and I are taking it easy.
1 HR AGO
That sounds pleasant. =)
1 HR AGO
You finally got the snow you were looking for.
1 HR AGO
I know :D
1 HR AGO
It‚Äôs so pretty. Snow makes the cold more bearable for me honestly.
1 HR AGO
Oh, yes. Otherwise, everything is dead and grey.
1 HR AGO
and piercing
1 HR AGO
Agreed. I‚Äôve also taken some time to plan things for our D&amp;D game. I took what you said to heart. I think I am being too hard on myself and need to just start somewhere.
1 HR AGO
Of all people I think you all would be the most gracious with me.
1 HR AGO
Certainly much more than my last group... lol
1 HR AGO
lol
1 HR AGO
Yeah, it will be cool. I think it's a good idea even if there were no game to play.
1 HR AGO
So I will get over myself and really settle down to make something for you all. Thank you for being patient with me.
1 HR AGO
Nothing to worry about. I still don't have everyone's machines setup. We're shifting everything around.
1 HR AGO
We can do whatever, but I'd like for us to all be in the same room.
1 HR AGO
Makes it more fun, I think.
1 HR AGO
Agreed!
1 HR AGO
How's the Witcher book series going?
1 HR AGO
I put it down for awhile but managed to make it through a book and a half pretty quickly.
1 HR AGO
Well, quickly for me at least lol. I forgot how many words I learn in reading new books. I need to keep sticking to it.
1 HR AGO
I need to make reading a habit again, learn to love it like I used to.
1 HR AGO
Aye. I can't read without a computer now. We let go of our physical dictionaries and reading/writing books.
1 HR AGO
I'm doing a poor job on that front myself.
1 HR AGO
Just feeling so swamped I can't squeeze it in.
1 HR AGO
It‚Äôs so easy to be distracted by other things.
1 HR AGO
SAME.
1 HR AGO
Yup.
1 HR AGO
Got to see my family yesterday ‚Äî that was really nice!
1 HR AGO
Mom‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs been taking care of herself more and I can see it. I‚Äôm really proud of her.
1 HR AGO
She said you two have been talking as well which is good to hear :&gt;
1 HR AGO
Aye. I'm grateful to have the chance to speak with her so consistently.
1 HR AGO
That's cool that you got to see the folks too.
1 HR AGO
I believe my donors will be in town to see my children and wife tomorrow. NOt as pleasant as yours,  but it's good for family to connect when they can.
1 HR AGO
Right. I didn‚Äôt even know they were in the states :o
1 HR AGO
And I hope they don‚Äôt cause you too much stress :/
1 HR AGO
Me too.
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
I'll be okay.
1 HR AGO
I have [[monster-10]], coffeebliss, and my family will be coming back home =)
1 HR AGO
\o/
1 HR AGO
If you‚Äôre really struggling I can distract you with the maps I‚Äôm building for our game xD
1 HR AGO
I like maps.
1 HR AGO
Also: https://philosopher.life/#Meditation
1 HR AGO
These ones are quite literally brain vomit. But hey, no one said they had to be realistic lol
1 HR AGO
I'll work on the diet and aerobic/strength exercise when I can.
1 HR AGO
I am the brain vomit. I'm totally cool with that.
1 HR AGO
I like it. :3
1 HR AGO
I know we agreed to be accountabilibuddies here. I'm starting slow with small steps, and I'm taking the ones I believe are most important and viable at the moment.
1 HR AGO
I‚Äôve actually been wanting to get into yoga for awhile... i don‚Äôt exactly care for the spiritual side of it, but I find devoting time away from screens is very relaxing... even if it‚Äôs hare to focus on not focusing lol.
1 HR AGO
Clearing my head is step one.
1 HR AGO
I appreciate that. And totally agree!
1 HR AGO
I have been doing minimal exercises ‚Äî leg lifts, short bursts of wall sits, other basic warm ups to get my body used to it all again. Weirdly it‚Äôs making a notable difference.
1 HR AGO
Cool.
1 HR AGO
How long does it take?
1 HR AGO
The small workouts or noticing the difference?
1 HR AGO
oh, both I suppose!
1 HR AGO
You do it in mornings, or how does it work and feel to you?
1 HR AGO
The exercise is usually only 30 minutes. I‚Äôve usually noticed the difference mostly in my mental clarity and my body not creaking like an old attic every time I get up. It happened a few days in.
1 HR AGO
I do it whenever I can actually. I‚Äôm terrible about sticking to a schedule.
1 HR AGO
It‚Äôs almost insulting how the simplest stretches make my muscles sore, but honestly I have been SO inactive.
1 HR AGO
Preach. That is my life.
1 HR AGO
Eventually, you'll get face your asthma, I assume.
1 HR AGO
I'm not looking forward to that for myself.
1 HR AGO
*If I ever get there, lol
1 HR AGO
I already kinda do when I play co-ed volleyball on Mondays. It‚Äôs... somethin. I sound like a chain smoker with as much as I cough.
1 HR AGO
lol
1 HR AGO
You got your inhaler?
1 HR AGO
I do!
1 HR AGO
I don‚Äôt go anywhere without it.
1 HR AGO
I haven't pushed myself that hard in a long time. I sprinted up the hill against my son last summer. I needed one then.
1 HR AGO
My sprinting is AMAZING, btw. It is absurd to know there are 6 and 7 year olds that can run faster than I can.
1 HR AGO
If the zombies ever come, I'm just going to let them eat me.
1 HR AGO
Exactly.
1 HR AGO
As an asthmatic, I prefer sprinting over long distance running.
1 HR AGO
At least after I‚Äôm done sprinting I can die xD
1 HR AGO
As a person who loves the &quot;as an X&quot; meme, I too appreciate prefer sprinting to long-distance running. I don't think I've ever done long-distance running. My personal best is under 8 minutes for a mile, and that was when I was in shape (lol!).
1 HR AGO
Damn son
1 HR AGO
I don‚Äôt know if I ever bothered recording my time. Most of my running was for after school sports.
1 HR AGO
Ah, 8 minutes is bad. I would be very surpised if you couldn't do 6-7 minute mile in your peak condition.
1 HR AGO
Now you are getting old and creaky.
1 HR AGO
Hehehehe
1 HR AGO
It happens when you sit still as a statue all day.
1 HR AGO
That's living the dream though.
1 HR AGO
Blobbin' it up.
1 HR AGO
Also, I'm not into the spiritual aspect of Yoga either. Just unblobbifying with it.
1 HR AGO
Exactly. Which it is terribly useful for!
