<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I saw Sonya on the way in. I gave her the minimum. Everything is fine (apparently she spoke more to me than anyone else...she didn't even talk to Whitney). Whitney and I connected again. I appreciate the chance to get to know her. I continue to immerse her in my skepticism to wake her up. We made peanut butter cups for the kids today and talked about her clothes. </p><p>I enjoy that I get to TGIF with everyone. That is a maymay we all appreciate. As usual, I must find every ounce of common ground I can  with those who tend to be so diametrically opposed to me. </p><p>Mitchell took the full 5th. This left Whitney and I the rest. Okay. I'm glad Mitchell has worked out a gameplan with the teachers. I am not in a position to hold these kids accountable without significant daily relationships with their teachers. It is interesting to see how lying is so effective among these networks; I see why the kids engage in it. Mitchell is the point man I cannot be; I don't have enough access. It reflects poorly on him in a way that it doesn't on me. </p><p>We went to library. I'm having to wrangle, but overall it is a free day (as handed down from on high). Delp continues to give me mixed signals in our interactions. I wonder what it means.</p><p>Matt has been showing up late everyday. He just wants to do paperwork and gladhand. Okay. I am continually reminded of social dominance theory and hierarchical reasoning when I see him. He is prescriptive about it without justification. I agree that power structures must exist, and I obviously agree that point of view is descriptively accurate. What the world &quot;ought&quot; to be, according to these folks, is insanity.</p></div>
