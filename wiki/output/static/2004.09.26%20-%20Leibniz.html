<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Leibniz undertook the task of proving that G-d would make the best of all possible worlds, and that our world is the best of all possible worlds. Leibniz thought human free will was not the cause of evil, but rather that evil arose out of the environment. Leibniz holds that the occurrence of evil is essential to the superior goodness of the whole. To be more specific: Leibniz argues that G-d created an environment with evil so that the world could be the best of all possible worlds‚Äî‚ÄúG-d made a world wherein there is evil,‚Äù a necessary evil (14). Leibniz does not hold evil to be a by-product, it wasn‚Äôt just permitted, but that evil is an essential ingredient woven into the fabric of this ‚Äúbest of all possible worlds.‚Äù To Leibniz, G-d had to create a world with evil, else it would not be the best of all possible worlds.</p><p>Leibniz‚Äôs first argument is: If we are convinced of the existence of an all-knowing, omnipotent, perfectly good creator, we must deduce that this world must be the best of all possible worlds; otherwise, the creator would not have sufficient reason to create this world. In response to the concept that evil is alone a creation of the free will of man (thus making man less than excellent), he responds, ‚Äúit is wrong to bring into existence, knowingly, a being less excellent than one could have brought into existence‚Äù (2). Thus, G-d created the most excellent being, a being that was determined by its ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù nature to produce evil. Further, G-d is responsible for this deterministic creation and all the evil produced from this creation, and He has done no evil because that which was created was simply a part of the greater whole. Leibniz holds that all of creation, including every being within our world, is the most excellent of all possible creations because it brings about the greatest possible net balance of good. For those who choke on this idea, he further comforts, ‚ÄúOne must understand that G-d [respectful emphasis] loves virtue supremely and hates vice supremely, and that nevertheless some vice is to be permitted‚Äù (6).</p><p>His argument is tempting because it attempts to solve, in a creative fashion, how G-d and evil can co-exist. Rational people tend to say that the creator of a deterministic or fatalistic object or environment is morally responsible for the deeds of that object or environment. If a person creates a robot, and that robot murders ten other beings, then that person (the creator) is morally responsible, at least in large part, for the death of those ten beings. Leibniz holds that G-d created a deterministic and/or fatalistic environment with determined necessary truths: among those are all existent evil. Leibniz is accusing G-d of not only permitting, but also creating evil. The problem is found in the notion that a being who a deterministic and/or fatalistic enivronment with evil, is committing an act evil‚Äîthus, G-d would be committing evil by creating a deterministic and/or fatalistic environment with evil  (even if it were simply for the purpose of having ‚Äúthe best of all possible worlds‚Äù). Although G-d may be part of the causal chain that leads to the existence of evil, He is not morally responsible for the existence of evil. Leibniz attempted to show that G-d is responsible for the existence of evil, but was acting in the interest of the ‚Äúbest of all possible worlds‚Äù (which supposedly is the action that would be chosen by a perfectly good, all-knowing, omnipotent being). The real question we must ask is: How is it possible for G-d, creator of the universe, to not be responsible for the existence of evil? Leibniz outright rejects the idea that G-d is not responsible for evil, placing the blame solely on G-d the creator‚ÄîLeibniz is incorrect. Leibniz believes that G-d is responsible for the existence of evil. Here is the basic argument against Leibniz‚Äôs claim:</p><ol><li>A being who creates a deterministic or fatalistic object or environment with evil, is committing an act evil.</li><li>A perfectly good, omnipotent, omniscient being cannot commit an act of evil.</li><li>Since G-d is a perfectly good, omnipotent, omniscient being, He could not create a deterministic and/or fatalistic object or environment with evil.</li></ol><p>Leibniz‚Äôs argument does not conform to the very definition of G-d, a G-d that is perfectly good, omnipotent, and omniscient. Is it that G-d is missing one of those attributes, or that he did not create the best of all possible worlds, or that he did not create a deterministic and/or fatalistic world? G-d cannot be morally responsible for evil, and yet he is still part of the causal chain that led to the existence of evil‚Ä¶How is this possible?</p><p>There are other ways to deal with the problem of evil. One could argue that the world is not necessarily the ‚Äúbest of all possible worlds‚Äù because it has evil, but rather because it merely possesses the possibility of evil, a possibility created through the free will of mankind. To further the argument, we would say that the ‚Äúpossibility of both good and evil,‚Äù agency, is good in itself and is an essential ingredient of the best of all possible worlds. Leibniz could keep his ‚Äúbest of all possible worlds,‚Äù and maintain that G-d has not committed an act of evil in creating this world, simply by changing what ingredients form the best of all possible worlds. 
However, Leibniz oversteps, and commits to the idea of G-d necessitating evil for the necessary greatest good. He should have simply explained that the greatest good is found in the ‚Äúpossibility of both good and evil.‚Äù This would allow G-d to be part of a causal chain leading to the existence of evil, without G-d being morally responsible for that evil. Ironically, this allows us to maintain that this world is the best of all possible worlds. Although I highly disagree with Leibniz‚Äôs conclusions, obviously he was part of the causal chain that led to this rewritten paper‚Äîthus helping to promote and maintain the best of all possible worlds. Right?</p></div>
