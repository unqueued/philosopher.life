<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Good morning. I trust you are well today.</p><p>In reading your entries I am working hard at finding the underlying feelings feeding into them and generated by them. I believe that is what you are asking of me, and I believe that is what you most need. I want the connection between us here to be one of mutual compassion. You have been in a lot of pain for a long time. That isn't really news to me. You don't broadcast your pain, but you don't exactly mask it, either.</p><p>I will not pretend to understand everything that you say. I am tech-challenged and my training has moved in different realms. But I do understand a great deal of what you share, and have wrestled a few of the same arguments, though with different outcomes. I respect your process.  </p><p>Let me ask you how you are dealing with some practical issues. (I ask out of concern, not judgment.) In most of the programs I have encountered, there is a screening policy. Have you thought about that, and how you will cope with it if it is a part of the program in which you are participating? Of course I am also concerned for your safety. I don't know what machinery you are handling, but please take great care to be alert and maintain a good reaction time. It is hard to be objective about personal balance. There are good reasons for professional monitoring of the balance between desired and side effects. You need another set of eyes on that with you.</p><p>Networking is good, but it does not replace forming friendships. Remember to find a space in your life for friendship. It is harder work than networking, but it is more durable and more valuable. Networks are useful, but friendships are more formational. You don't need a lot of friends, but life is easier when you have a few.</p><p>Fresh air and sunshine are more than elements of a walk outside. A friend is someone who brings the social, emotional and spiritual equivalent of fresh air and sunshine into your life. I pray for a friend to come alongside you to open windows to possibilities you have not discovered.</p><p>Love always,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="R.html">R</a>
</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hey R,</p><p>I am doing well today. Thank you for asking (it is important to ask). To be specific: I've been feeling better since I feel like I have more direction in my life. Even if the plan isn't perfect, I have goals and a vision now. I wake up in the morning with a mission. I finally have a fire in my belly again. I hope I am not too polarized by and addicted to that mission, purpose-filled, vocation feeling. I am watching myself. Also, my sleep schedule has normalized (woot!).</p><p>How are you doing? I hope you don't think I'm out of place to ask, and you shouldn't feel compelled to answer. You are my counselor+friend+family, and it might be weird for you to reply with substance (you won't offend me). Rest assured, your response here will be redacted from my posting. I am privacy conscious (and I can see even in your word choice that you are as well). My posts are sanitized (yet honest).</p><p>If I understand you correctly, I think you are right about what I need. I'm trying to isolate the causes of these underlying feelings, which I take to be a set of beliefs (conscious or subconscious) which aren't coherent together or may be incorrect in themselves. I hope writing about these feelings and beliefs will help me change. Of course, I'm not always sure what I need to be writing about. I've been taking a shotgun approach to the problem. I write about whatever pops into my head, whatever my gut is telling me (since I think my gut/intuition is where the problems reside). Reading my spaghetti might be frustrating. Feel free to prompt me with a topic or area you want me to think about and write on. If you want me to clarify something for you or myself, please tell me. I make many mistakes. </p><p>I also want mutual compassion. To be clear, you have been compassionate. I hear your voice as I read your letters. Conversely, I also know there is enormous anger (and sometimes insanity) in my writing here. I hope you don't take it personally (I know you have spoken to this already). I don't mean it as an attack on you at all. My mind can be dark and messy, and I'm sorry for that. I'm not good at hiding things, and I'm not sure if it would be a good thing to try and whitewash it. Unfortunately, I lack tact, and my honesty is destructive even when I don't intend it to be (I am working to be more empathic, especially in my delivery; it is not an innate skill of mine). If I'm not being compassionate, please call me out on it in the manner you see fit. I appreciate your taking the time to be my accountabilibuddy. I am listening to you, and I will do so with charity.</p><p>Your practical questions are important to me (keep them coming). I appreciate your concern. It is important to ask me! In this case, I have thought about these problems for a while. </p><p>The program does not screen. To be clear, they couldn't have a program if they did. The class is a wonderful group of misfits, felons, and substance users. So, no problems on that front. However, you are correct that the screening process can be a real barrier in the job market. It would not be wise to close doors or burn bridges. </p><p>Ketamine is the most valuable of medicines for treatment-resistant depression. It and its analogs are fairly uncommon substances to use illegally (recreationally or medicinally). None of the standardized drug tests actually test for ketamine. There are some extended panel lab tests which check for ketamine metabolites, but these are rare (although, I saw one study that showed some tests will give false positives for phencyclidine). Regardless, the half-life of the substance is 3-7 days, taking between 1-2 weeks to reach baseline. Both blood and urine samples can only detect within that 2-week range (2-4 days is the usual detection range for these tests, and only the specialized tests can go all the way to 2 weeks), except for very heavy use. Abstaining from a weekly 20mg DCK dose would enable someone to pass even the most extensive testing. Interviews and testing procedures can usually be planned for within this time frame.</p><p>Cannabis, however, is always tested. Unfortunately, edible users have extra difficulties as well, especially because THC is fat-soluble. Unfortunately, an obese person may still have THC-COOH stored up in their fat cells generated even a couple years ago (yikes). Needless to say, this is a minefield. Losing weight and maximizing one's metabolism is the only way to flush this out. </p><p>In microdosing cannabutter (6 days a week) and taking 2-week tolerance-breaks/reality-checks every 2 months, a chronic medicinal user would need to abstain for a bare minimum of 21 days to pass a urine test, and more likely 33-48 days (I've even seen recommendations up to 72-90 days). Hair test detection ranges from 7-90 days. Blood tests detect up to 7 days and saliva for only 24-48 hours. </p><p>Basically, employers using saliva tests are seeking to make sure all (or nearly all) their employers pass, regardless of reality. The most common test to worry about is the urine test. A wise man would begin abstaining at least a month before he projected the testing procedure, and probably 2 months for good measure. He would also create dossiers on the employers in his area, including their pre-employment, scheduled, and random drug-testing procedures (although, you can't always find accurate information). Self-testing kits are also necessary. There is no point to going through the interview+testing procedure if you can't pass it on your own.</p><p>One must be concerned with random drug testing. With good relationships, an employee can often be warned well in advance (especially if they are seen as an asset to the employer). This varies with the company you work for. It is crucial to understand the actual enforcement of drug policies in a company. Unfortunately, it can't always be planned for. If there is an accident, many companies will immediately administer testing on the spot. Thankfully, a wise person who uses cannabis medicinally would never endanger themselves or others by using on the job (that defeats the purpose of it). While high THC-COOH levels (being under the influence on the job) will never be found (avoiding liability), one would still fail the test (sufficient for being fired). This is where real risk analysis comes in. It's a judgment call that one must take into account given one's broader context.</p><p>Ultimately, it is the goal of every unwell person to become well, and if possible, unconditionally so. That is to say, nobody wants to use medicine if they could be just as happy, functioning, and fruitful without it. Cannabis, at least for some people, is an excellent tool for dealing with anxiety. Thus, anxiety-based medicinal users should seek to identify and solve the sources of their anxiety and find coping mechanisms which allow them to forego medicine when possible. Random testing only further motivates that problem. </p><p>As to having a professional monitor, I'm not convinced this is nicely solvable. I agree on the objectivity problem. I am not, however, convinced there are good options available. I have been down that road. Sometimes, you have to be your own health advocate because no one else is going to do it. That is far from ideal, but it may be the only practical option. I realize that everyone feels they are the exception to the rule, and down that path, we rationalize and confabulate (so, you may be saying to me: &quot;Danger, Will Robinson!&quot;). I am open to talking about it. Admittedly, I need to be convinced. For now, the only consistent (yet non-professional) sources of (pseudo)objectivity I have available to me are from my conversations with my brothers (every couple days) and family. </p><p>The practical problem of socialization is also significant. I have vanishingly few people I can talk to, especially in person. Loneliness sucks. It sounds weird to be lonely even with a spouse as amazing as my wife. She is the One. She gets me. Of course, I fear I cannot complete her without believing in God (I am aware of the outlines of the theology of marriage), but not the other way around. We are best friends, and my loneliness is in no way her fault, but I think it is reasonable to hope for more than one friend (she does too). </p><p>It's a fact that men tend to develop smaller networks (I do not mean in this the &quot;networking&quot; sense) of true friends. It is why they tend to die within a few years of their spouse passing, but not the other way around. Men, for genetic and memetic evolutionary reasons, lack strong social support structures. </p><p>You are very right about the lack of friendship. I am slowly cataloging my history of friendships so that I can closely inspect them and understand what I've done right and wrong. Without trying to be arrogant, finding peers is not easy for me. There may easily be something deeply wrong about my assumptions and the way I approach friendship. It is a concept I've been thinking about for a long time now.</p><p>To be clear: I don't care about networking, except insofar as it is instrumental to me. Ugh. I could write a book on my disdain for networking, the generation of social capital. My Kantian side finds it abhorrent. I think it is the equivalent of using people. It's icky to me, and I can't double-effect my way out of it. I have no interest in shallow relationships. I demand honesty, authenticity, and directness. I want to &quot;be myself&quot; with my friends (not many people would appreciate who I am). Anything less is, at least to that degree, not really friendship to me. Of course, I realize this doesn't happen overnight. </p><p>I'm a man who prefers having a few very close friends rather than a bunch of acquaintances. I am a control freak, and I rarely make myself fundamentally vulnerable to others. Few pass into my inner circle, and those who violate my personal code are rarely allowed to enter it again (you are hereby explicitly granted immunity for our letters). </p><p>I have been on a mission to &quot;find the others&quot; for a while now. I'm looking for people I'd lay down in the middle of traffic for, and vice versa. Actually, I'm looking for family. Perhaps I'm seeking people I value more than myself. Unfortunately, I moved away from one of &quot;the others&quot; in New Orleans (we stay in touch and plan visits, but long-distance relationships really aren't the same). My brother and I have a deal we made with each other to find good friends (we both need them). It's slow going. Cool enough, I may have found one here. </p><p>My neighbor (my wife's boss) is an exceptional man. He's autistic with graduate degrees in library science, theology, and something else (something to do with biology, I think). He said it is his new year's resolution to get to know me (and our family) this year. He is a very quirky man (as am I), and I like him a lot. We sometimes walk and talk, and I see we have similar struggles. I must do that more. I need to make a point of it. He's very finicky about certain things (not in a bad way, it's just part of his nature), so I will see if I can schedule time with him on a weekly basis. Maybe we can have a game night with our families. </p><p>On a related note, I've actually tried to reach out to your brother. He's not very talkative over e-mail (that doesn't mean he isn't paying attention though). Our brief phone conversation over Thanksgiving was good though. It's much easier to connect with him that way. While I know you love me, it may be possible you view me as a kind of poison: a volatile-appearing, broken man with dangerous ideas. I would never seek to endanger our family. So, I'll just straight up ask you: is it okay with you if I become better friends with your brother? I doubt we would ever be super close, but I'd like to be his friend. I love talking to him. He's wonderful.</p><p>This may also sound dumb, but how do you define friendship? We are in agreement on the assessment you've given so far.</p><p>Let me say again, I could easily be wrong about these things. This is a work in progress. Admittedly, I seek reasons to accept and reject my beliefs. Of course, I may just be accused of lacking integrity here, that somehow trying to be so excruciatingly rational is itself a thought-terminator, a smoke-screen, and a method to confabulate.</p><p>Anyways, I know you might not have the answers or be able to say it in the way I need to hear it, but I am listening. Thank you for listening to me. I know this is a lot of work, and I'm not claiming you are obligated to help me. </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a>
