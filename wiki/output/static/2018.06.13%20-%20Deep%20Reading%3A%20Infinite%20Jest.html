<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Of course, all smart people can immediately identify, to whatever <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> they may, with some prodigy.</p><p>The intro is filled with people I find deplorable.</p><p>The capitalist jockeying is quite real. The deceptive practices I expect in socializing are there. They literally talk about the appearance of &quot;using people,&quot; as if they don't actually have a problem with it, but need excuses for it.</p><p>Trying to justify ourselves to others sucks. It sounds like the kid is having to justify himself to himself as well. Been there! =)</p><p>DFW is clearly a wordsmith. It's fun!</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am not what you see and hear... I'm not
</p></blockquote><p>Kid breaks down, and for good reason: why the fuck should we play these language games?</p><p>The discussion of his addiction is fascinating. I don't feel like I've had the same social manipulation situations arise for me, but that's because I've only bought cannabis twice (it has lasted me for many years). RCs I bought online, the same for the reagents for all the psychedelics I've created myself. My brothers have also helped me. Perhaps part of my issue is that I plan in advance, but I'm also not so ashamed of my usage as most people.</p><p>I have strong opinions about dependency, addiction, substance use, etc. I think agency itself isn't nearly as a clean a philosophical concept as the people around me. </p><p>For me, I ask my Kantian-constrained Utility Maximization question, and that decides when and what I use. I can't say I'm great at it, but I don't really have anyone else to turn to. I regularly speak with my family about the topic as well. </p><p>Perhaps we must all justify it to ourselves and others. And, what behaviors don't have that?</p><p>This kid has a difficult relationship with his substance. He doesn't actually enjoy it, or so he seems to tell himself. He uses a lot more than I do. It does appear more addictive; although, I'll certainly agree to having a dependence. My life is simply better with it; it is a means to my end of happiness. </p><p>This kid is really good at lying to himself at others. </p><p>Can't stop talking about having intercourse either. Does he feel like a prostitute?</p><p>I hate to say it, but I don't connect nicely with the bourgeois kid.</p><p>Why don't I feel the same pressure? Is it because I tend to take it whenever I want it? I tend to not take it for a couple reasons: I want to be sober, I don't feel like it, I don't have enough time (since I use edibles exclusively), and I'm using another substance. It's usually a matter of whether or not it fits into my context.</p><p>I love the &quot;cartridge&quot; language. Those are the kinds of moves I make as well.</p><p>Okay, it's time to be more paranoid about my autistic inability to understand myself. Do I engage in this behavior and reasoning without realizing it? Look, I obviously have a lot to say about the topic.</p><p>You can hear the author through this kid. The Grammarian (or nazi ;P) can't help himself. Words are his addiction too.</p><p>The Nix is a hell of a lot like this book.</p><p>I'm an &quot;OED&quot; man. That is a true user.</p><p>The &quot;conversationalist&quot; seems too informed. It's kind of weird. Perhaps I've truly missed something.</p><p>Kids with eidetic memory often have difficult times understanding their world because they can't fail to remember, they don't know how to pick out what is salient in the world. In a way, wisdom is reduction itself of the world, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a>.</p><p>I can't say I relate to the character in that I was never as ambitious, knowledgeable, or goal-oriented. </p><p>Doctor's cartridges and sex.</p><p>I can't say I'm a huge fan of the Reginald line either. A collection of disconnected short stories can be annoying. I suppose the book is a lot of work in this respect.</p><p>I can't say I understand the year of depend undergarment, but this book is insanely non-linear. </p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.thehowlingfantods.com/dfw/images/theses/chronijfinal1.3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.thehowlingfantods.com/dfw/images/theses/chronijfinal1.3.pdf</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171120111730/http://faculty.sunydutchess.edu:80/oneill/Infinite.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20171120111730/http://faculty.sunydutchess.edu:80/oneill/Infinite.htm</a></li></ul><p>I'm sorely tempted to just read it linearly.
