<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was productive. Before anything started, I grabbed the good level and grinder for our table. I also got the next chapter's study guide from Luke Ferguson.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> I helped TJ with the math on buttwelds. He said he loves my teaching style. I do not hear that often. He obviously had some terrible teachers. Ferguson and I were eventually given a special offset drawing to complete. </p><p>I did the math twice, then I had Ferguson check it. He didn't seem to care much for it. He just &quot;trusted me&quot; by and large. Eh. I told him that if I was going to be wrong, then we would be wrong together. I want his commitment to the math.</p><p>I asked to cut the pipes this time. This was due to the fact that I've yet to have the chance to do it for socket welds, but also because I'm simply more careful than Ferguson. The cuts, of course, were good. Ferguson is much slower in prep work than I am. By the time I cut finished cutting pipe (I nailed it on my first try, just guessing how much we needed), he hadn't even finished 80% of the tip-grinds. In contrast, I had finished all the flanges, socket joints, and pipes (minus the last one) by the time he was finished cutting. So, I helped finish the prep work. </p><p>Ferguson decided not to help with the prep after I joined him and went onto trying to build. This was a costly mistake since he did not build the special offset first. He started at the top instead. He should know better. He didn't. After I finished my work, I came to look at what he was doing, and I pointed out that it was a mistake. He said it should be fine, and that he had done it before. I explained why it wasn't a good idea, but that we would try it his way. Of course, after 3 tries (had to cut-grind the tacks and try it again), he decided to try it the right way. So, we did. It worked, but his original mistake still carried through. The top pipe was still very slightly crooked (because I didn't ask him to completely disassemble it), although we compensated for it with the flange. Still, it was off. If you looked at the correct angle, you could barely see it too. The level on the flange, of course, lied. The pipe did not lie though. The teacher didn't officially recognize anything was wrong with it, but I could tell he felt something was off, even though he couldn't put his finger on it. He gazed at it, but couldn't figure out what it might have been. It was a slight defect, and our flange compensation covered it up. He'd need to use our custom leveling tool to figure it out, but he doesn't usually care that much. </p><p>We did get something officially wrong though. Ferguson had picked out a lap joint (I often call it Lapdance flange as a poor mnemonic device) flange instead of a standard raised-face flange. I didn't realize he had done it until after it was tacked on. We grabbed the right flange, cut off the old one, and quickly applied the new one. The teacher okayed it. We deconstructed it and cleaned up. Luke left early.</p><p>I will say that Luke was much easier to work with this time around overall. He realized that working with me required trying to get it right the first time. He cared about the details because I did. I appreciate that very much. I regularly check our work throughout the process. He is beginning to see the sense in it, I think. He knows how to do it, but he often neglects it. I go through the exact checks (and then some) that our teacher does, especially when I believe that hammering/readjusting a piece may have rotated the fabrication out of alignment. I was especially glad that he had the patience for getting the special offset right. The overall design of this fabrication was very simple, and ultimately, the point of it was simply to test us on our ability to nail the special offset angle and the true lengths of the box. </p><p>Again, his spatial reasoning was fairly on point today. His ability to articulate what he can see isn't so hot. He only made one error that I could see in this department, but it was tricky to see. The flange compensation had to be done after rotating the fabrication in the vise 90 degrees. Knowing which direction to compensate wasn't easy to see (he seemed to forget we needed to compensate at first, but also didn't see which direction afterward until I described the reason with my hands). Sometimes it feels like we are speaking a different language. Sometimes, we both understood the same thing, it just isn't obvious to each of us that the other also understands it.</p><p>Luke said he'd be joining the welding program after finishing the pipefitting program. Apparently, he signed up for it a year ago, and they've made room for him. He will do a good job. It's a shame he won't be joining me at the union. I'm hoping that he and TJ will join me. This may be a very smart move on Luke's part though. He will easily be a certified welder in that year's worth of practice (and given his current skill, it may take very little time...although, he is kind of lazy in some respects).</p><p>I suspect this may be the last socket weld I do in class. I weld tomorrow, and Friday is devoted to testing and going over this trimester's grades. We'll be off for a week, and the teacher indicated that we'd be going to buttwelds at the beginning of the next trimester. Since we've done the special offset, we've finished the tail end kinds of fabrications that he has prepared for students as well. Since we have learned math, it does seem like practice is all that is left. It's a matter of getting the bevels right. But, my teacher knows I've learned how to bevel flat plates quite well (although, not pipe). Buttwelds look fairly simple with the exception of the actual fitting itself. That will take some practice.</p><p>I want to build pipefitting/welder dogs to make buttwelds even easier. Alignment is really the key difficulty, from what I can see. I want to make sure I understand how to use standard tools, and how to build them on the fly when I need them.</p><p>I went to see the admin office after lunch. I'm still waiting on AB&amp;T to follow through on the paperwork/payment. Otherwise, I will not be able to afford to attend school. Apparently, lots of students are waiting on AB&amp;T.</p><p>I cleaned the 2-holes with a file. People have been leaving slag on it, which upsets the teacher (expensive little buggers). </p><p>The teacher will be out tomorrow. The old man I talked about before, the liaison, will be our substitute. Apparently, I will be helping Chris tack his project. Chris, of course, enjoys doing all the work himself. So, I take it that I'll be doing my welding without interruptions. Keaton said he would be joining me.</p><p>Also, the electrical instructor won't be helping me fix our dryer. I shouldn't have expected or predicted him to. I thought he might not, and I was right. =/</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span>  I need to remember to call him Luke (at least to his face), and not by his last name. It's just rude of me not to.</sub></p></div>
