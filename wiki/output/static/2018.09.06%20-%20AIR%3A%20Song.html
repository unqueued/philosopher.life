<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Setting up my bro's computer for him. He went through a lot of hoops to make it happen, and I know it's not fun for him. I appreciate it, and I hope I can be useful to him. I think he won't be going the linux route. I am, of course, quite torn on the matter. Perhaps in time he will choose it. For now, I just want to have something working for him.</p><p>I preached the gospel of the wiki as usual.</p><p>I'm really glad he's thinking about himself (and I don't mean in some dark triadic way, I mean in a honest and constructive way). </p><p>He sent me a song to think about:</p><pre><code>Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here 'till the moment I'm gone
You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love
And not feel your reign
Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am, and I stand
So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me
Oh, you loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while
And all my fragile strength is gone
Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am, and I stand
So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me
I live here on my knees as I try to make you see
That you're everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
You're keeping me down, eh ooh
You're on to me, on to me, and all over
Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long</code></pre><p>The contradiction of love at best, but more likely the problems of emotional dependency upon another. Perhaps some relationships are addictions. Heartbreak is hard to get over. I think I see why people are moved by it. Vulnerability of The Other is here.</p></div>
