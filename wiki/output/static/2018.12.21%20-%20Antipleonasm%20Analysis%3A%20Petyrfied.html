<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Respond to the following:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Don‚Äôt fight in the North or the South. Fight every battle everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend. Every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you‚Äôve seen before.
</p></blockquote><p>Petyr is almost a zen control-freak; this reads like some Art of War pericope.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">b</sup></button> Of course, this extreme perspective isn't feasible; it is the impractical ideal. Yet, obviously, there is something correct in his words. There is a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="diamond.html">diamond</a> in it. There must be a way to pragmatize the ideal to our context. Scaling the infinite <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="agi.html">agi</a> considerations down to our finite context is the task of virtue theory (and, indeed, philosophy more generally). </p><p>Yes, Petyr, there is a virtue to the practice of the material dialectic. To be a virtuous fighter in your context is objectively possible even if the particularized rules and reasons (and the method or process by which you arrive at them) for your circumstances may differ to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> from others. </p><p>The pursuit of certainty has a perilous beauty to it. The desire not to be surprised,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> to just know without doubt, to feel safe in your knowledge, to be at epistemic peace, to rightfully have the chance to let your guard down, to lie down beside still waters, to achieve the zen-like control over yourself, to be able to to trust yourself and your models of the world (and the stories we tell ourselves) often appears to be a necessary desire. I do not claim that Petyr is motivated by these though.</p><p>Tangent: it appears the zen masters quell their desire and their identities through meditation, but it appears to be a rationalization and the practice of inserting yourself into mere simulation. Internal harmony does imply external unity. Just because you don't desire doesn't mean you shouldn't; just because you think there is no &quot;you&quot; doesn't mean you aren't real.</p><p>When we are charitable to him, it is obvious he knows that he cannot fully accomplish his task, he can only ever improve his method and make progress. There is something feasible here.</p><p>Clearly, Petyr aims to be the sublator of the material dialectic. Look at the enemy we must decentralize power against. He causes a paranoia in me. His efficacy and single-minded pursuit of power is a danger to civilization itself. He brings a contradiction with him that will cause a collapse. I suggest the elite loosely and accidentally form an emergent agential structure like Petyr (though far less aware, competent, unified, and organized). We face a golem which emerges from the zerosum dimension of our species; it is Darwinianly fit enough to converge upon and wickedly apply a loose semblance of the reasoning Petyr provides here.</p><p>We cannot win on his terms, but his strategy must be something we empathize with and employ collectively. Indeed, we are at war, but we cannot be at war with everyone. Who shall be the outgroup and why? It is only in faith of the possibility of goodwill of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> that something greater can emerge from our species. If we do not practice <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> en masse, we will lose forever. Indeed, I think <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520End%2520of%2520Humanity.html">The End of Humanity</a> is coming. The only way to defeat the tragedy of the commons is through a triumph of the commons. I wish prayer mattered. I only have <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> now.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">b : </span> Come on, Bruce Lee, tell us how to prepare for our battles.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">a : </span> Autists know what it do. :P</sub></p></div>
