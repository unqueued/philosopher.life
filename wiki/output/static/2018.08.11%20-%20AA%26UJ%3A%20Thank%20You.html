If you care to look in this wiki,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">g</sup></button> you will see I have been thinking about how to respond for a while. I can wait no longer. Thank you for reaching out to us. You all have been kind to us many times: thank you! We appreciate your gifts and hosting us in your thoughts, and I hope you know you are in our thoughts as well. </p><p>I know the gifts are from your family as a whole, and that is how we accepted them. We feel your love in them. I also must recognize, meaning no offense to my favorite Uncle (a man I'm truly proud to call my Uncle<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button>), having watched AA's employment and gifted gift-giving talents for decades, I suspect she is more likely the primary force behind their choosing (I could easily be wrong, of course<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">wg</sup></button>). I have paid attention to your hospitality, and I wish I had the gumption to send you a gift first! Maybe <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Finding%2520The%2520Others.html">Finding The Others</a> is a graceful skill I too will acquire with age. In any case, I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> to repay your kindness.</p><p>I've been trying to reconnect with many people (e.g. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.07.14%2520-%2520L%2526K%253A%2520Let's%2520Reset!.html">2018.07.14 - L&amp;K: Let's Reset!</a>), but I'm still not sure how to connect with you. I hope you will thoughtfully consider the kind of relationship I aim to have with you and others (see: {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Contact.html">Contact</a>}). Let me warn you in advance, this wiki is much larger than it appears.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t</sup></button> I upload my mind into this self-representation. I hope in time, you will appreciate the method to my madness. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say. {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Help.html">Help</a>} may be a useful introduction to this wiki for you. Please feel free to engage me in words because this is who I am to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>. </p><p>Indeed, through your book as proxy, you have engaged us with words. My brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="L.html">L</a> were talking about this book you wanted him to read a while back, so I was not shocked to receive a copy. Thank you. I value the written word greatly. I appreciate the opportunity to examine your words spoken through these authors. Letterwriting and bookgiving can be powerful, and they're meant to be. Now I must ask you a question to which I somewhat fear the answer: do you really want to know what I think and how I feel about this book?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">w</sup></button></p><p>It matters to me that you are actually interested in what I have to say about the book you sent.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">f</sup></button> Do you really wish to incur the cost of engaging in this text with us?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">c</sup></button> If not, I would like to understand why. I want to understand your motivation and goals in our relationship.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">y</sup></button> I'm using a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> (Golden Rule-based) strategy with you, and I hope for us to be transparently explicit out in this open desert.</p><p>Despite how weird or stupid I may look in this wiki, I legitimately aim to make {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">My Faith</a>} as rational as I possibly can.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">r</sup></button> I will wrestle hard with the book you sent us.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">n</sup></button> Even a cursory glance through this wiki should demonstrate to you that I am clearly open to the possibility that I am radically wrong. Are you? Will you pay the same price of openness to being radically wrong on our behalf? You test all of our faiths in this gift. Thank you for the opportunity.</p><p>Here's where I'm working on it: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Jesus%2520Among%2520Secular%2520Gods%253A%2520The%2520Countercultural%2520Claims%2520of%2520Christ.html">Jesus Among Secular Gods: The Countercultural Claims of Christ</a>. My <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">wife</a> asked me to stop at the first chapter, since it's a fine stopping place to see what you think. This is me taking you and your beliefs very seriously.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">i</sup></button> I want you to see that I've fired up my CPU on all cores for you, and I'm not playing a game here. I don't expect you to try as hard as I have, necessarily, but I do expect you to at least charitably attempt to understand where I'm coming from. </p><p>We should also address another 900-pound gorilla in the room: we may be involved in a social triangle which includes my donors, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="MWF.html">MWF</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SLT.html">SLT</a>. My dispute with them is not with you. I do not wish to interfere with your relationship with them. I appreciate your desire to reach out to us despite this complication.</p><p>I suspect you have only heard their side of the story; I'm trying to give you the chance to hear mine as clearly and kindly as I can say it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">l</sup></button> Given what may be completely unfounded suspicions,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">x</sup></button> I ask you to forgive me for not knowing if you act on my donors' behalf or to what extent they influence your perceptions of reality here. You have been kind to us, and I seek to repay you in kind. Thinking about your book and writing this letter has been no small task.</p><p>It's no accident that all three of their sons, the people who know them best, actively avoid them to varying <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>. I'm not sure how you interpret the situation or who we are.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> It's likely the case we have radically different experiences and understandings of the events and people in question. I suggest you put on your charity lenses, even if that means calling into doubt what you thought you knew about people you love.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">z</sup></button> Of course, that doesn't mean you will agree with me. This side conflict is inevitably integrated into our relationship though, and so we have to look at it together.</p><p>My transparency is no accident; in their case, it's partly a matter of vindication.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">m</sup></button> I'm not here to convince you, but I do aim to give you a bridge to see it from my side. You should know: this wiki actually started two years ago as a letter to my donors: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2016.10.17%2520-%2520Letter%2520to%2520Mom%2520and%2520Dad.html">2016.10.17 - Letter to Mom and Dad</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">h</sup></button> Since then, I have written at length about these issues. If you intend to step in between as a middleman proxy or third-party, rather than watching on the sidelines, I hope you are prepared to reason extremely carefully with me.</p><p>I beg you to be incredibly honest with yourselves and me. I'm going to wager I've spent far more time thinking about this issue than you have, and so I ask you address my argument carefully if you think it is wrong (which it very well may be). Tell me what you're thinking.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">k</sup></button> You are hereby granted the right to say exactly what you need to say, the right to have the last word between us, and the right to demand my charity or re-evaluation (tell me I've strawmanned you, that I'm radically wrong, that I've misrepresented the facts, or that I need to get my head on straight). I'm listening. </p><p>Ask yourself how many letters like this you've received in your life. This is an important moment in our relationship. It's possible you'll never receive another one like it again in your lifetime, and I'd like you to think about the nature of that uniqueness. Please take as much time as you need to respond. I aim to give you a bridge to cross, even if you can't cross it right now.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">v</sup></button> I really do love you. </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">wf : </span> You can find my wife's response here: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://bookwyrm.philosopher.life/#JASG%3A%20A%26J" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://bookwyrm.philosopher.life/#JASG%3A%20A%26J</a></sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">d : </span> For the record, this letter (and wiki more generally) is meant to be read on a desktop or laptop.
