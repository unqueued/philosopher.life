<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Dear kickscondor,</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to write me again. It means a lot to me that you do not give up! I aim to repay your kindness in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. I can see that my supposition (and thus interpretation) in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.09.10%2520-%2520kickscondor%253A%2520Qualia%2520is%2520Personal.html">my previous letter</a> was wrong. Good! I feared I had unknowingly opened a profound wound, and I am especially glad to be wrong. Since you are not helplessly suffering in the desert, it appears our wrestling dialectic (which I'm not in a position to immediately soften in this letter) can ethically continue in the usual way. Good!</p><p>I appreciate the reset opportunity you offer. I also need to apologize for my lack of clarity (even when I am trying my best I will fail here). One complication of my openness is that I may fail to sufficiently distinguish my brainstorming, drafting, and thinking (the methods and steps by which I arrive at my conclusions) from the letters I specifically address to you. I did not signal correctly; I am sorry. You are free to offer a critique, and I will think carefully out loud about it.</p><p>It was in the brainstorming that I felt I stumbled across an egregious error of mine which morally required me to silence my wrestling (as far as it is conceptually possible) in the dialectic, although I certainly aimed to assist you in what appeared to be unbearable suffering (I have waited for confirmation in either direction). Among the steps I took, I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a>ified my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.09.10%2520-%2520%252Fb%252F.html">brainstormed thoughts</a> to try to make that clearer. You are, of course, free to hold me accountable to the evolution of my thoughts (I suggest you do in this letter). Those thoughts are mine, even if I did not take myself to be concluding, committing, or fully assenting to them at the time.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> Now that I see the conclusion I drew from my assumption has been shown to be irrelevant, I can pull those thoughts off the shelf. I think you've significantly attempted to right the issue though, and you've clarified for me some of the interactive goals of our relationship. Thank you.</p><p>I have a concern which I ask you bear in mind for me throughout this letter: I am what many people consider to be a profoundly dogmatic person and a man of obsessive conviction who at times maintains a preoccupation with precision which sometimes extends far beyond what many humans take to be reasonable. I dare to think I'm right, even when it's an affront to others at times (<em>so edgy!</em>). That makes me a huge anti-social pain in the ass to some humans, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm mistaken. I've learned that I have to make some major commitments (some of them fairly unpopular and polarizing) in order to make progress, and however arrogant I may appear or actually be: I know I can be wrong. I'd like to think I tend not to be convinced of my views by accident. I hope you will think extremely carefully about all appearances of dogmatism in me. I will listen carefully to what you say, so make sure you say it as carefully as you can, please. You may not want to wrestle with my dogmatic views (especially since I will require you to wrestle with yours in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>). I may seem impolite about the issue, but I do not believe I'm immoral in this practice.</p><p>I hope you see that I have spent a great deal of time and thought trying to respond to you, and I ask you for only a portion of the effort I give you in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. I ask you let this letter sit in your pocket for a couple weeks before you respond because there is much to consider here. You will need to pick the threads and the course of our relationship.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Hi h0p3-</p><p>So I am going to try to rewind and do as you say: to take a better shot at addressing your part of our 'hyperconversation'.
</p></blockquote><p>Thank you for taking the time to readdress my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.08.23%2520-%2520kickscondor%253A%2520Hyperconversations.html">letter</a>. That means a great deal to me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am sending you this as a private letter so that you can censor it if you like.
</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate the opportunity you afford me, an opportunity I explicitly (but unironically) do not afford you. As you know, your gift is meaningful to me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I feel like I am starting to border on a troll of some type ;) and feel like the nature of my blog would turn this into a type of 'broadcast' that can still receive 'thumbs up' and such sordid things.
</p></blockquote><p>Ha. Don't worry, even when I think you are mistaken, I don't think you are <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.27bslash6.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trolling</a>. You provide evidence, much of it public, that you cooperate and empathize. I suggest no (or vanishingly few, from a heuristical standpoint) hypothetical ideally objective Rational persons<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pan</sup></button> watching us would believe otherwise (I hold such a thing in extremely high regard). I also appreciate your desire to curb undue social desirability bias. You are clearly aware of the challenges of reasoning out loud with each other. Thank you for your willingness to repeatedly think with me about it. I hope to do you justice.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I hope I can preface these remarks - even if it seems like a bad idea, because it can perceived as changing the topic, taking time away from the 'meat'. I will get to the topic(s) - but I wonder if some other items might be more pressing (might even be the 'meat') because it seems they might be preventing the main discussion from occurring fruitfully.
</p></blockquote><p>Go for it! I never know how a conversation should optimally evolve or resolve. I'll take every ounce of context, preface, and caveat you're willing to provide. I think it's one of the strengths of writing over speaking. I'm looking to see your big picture story uninterrupted. In a sense, my wiki is a ridiculously weaker version of that context-giving because it isn't tailored specifically for you and this particular letter (it's probably a mere heap, I realize; whatever my wiki indirectly provides to this letter, it's likely even weaker than I imagine).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button></p><p>You clearly aim to have a fruitful dialectic. Thank you! I am still not sure what you really think the fruit should be, and obviously, I have strong opinions on what counts as fruit and which fruits are most valuable. Please tell me if and when I fail to cooperate, and I will do my best to rectify it.</p><p>I want to continue rabbitholing our rhizome with you. Sometimes your threads take me down many paths which don't seem immediately pertinent or fun to everyone. Often proofs in logic require a great deal of wandering (and, indeed, I think that's also what we do in natural language for the most part). In part, I'm not sure how best to form accurate theories of each others minds without engaging in this purposeful wandering (it is somewhat like a monte carlo simulation). I think it does systematically add up though. They are risks worth taking in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>.</p><p>One of our confusions seems to be that I did not highlight the main body of my argument (a response to your pressing me for the moral justification of my behavior, which you do yet again in this letter) well enough, and so I am worried that running down multiple threads might detract from the conversation. I'm not sure how to resolve this issue for us. Sometimes the rhizome is gorgeous and sometimes it's just a problem, and I can see it cannot be perfectly solved. I suggest we will continue to optimize. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>ON BEING 'INTELLECTUAL' Ok, so stepping back - I've jumped headlong into a discussion with you. (And might I just add: this is a rare opportunity for me and I feel fortunate to have the chance to converse - for you to respect my communications enough that you will give them the thought you have. I have NEVER had the opportunity to correspond in a strictly written way with anyone ever before - to attempt to come to an understanding with them - hmm, well, maybe once, but not to this extent - and this whole time I am wondering if the medium has its limits. I guess this is where Socrates chimes in. Well, of course it does - but I am probably the largest of those limitations - and that feels good. Perhaps my ability to write will strain under the pressure, perhaps yours - and it requires even more of our abilities to read and internalize each other's writings! For this reason, I would like the conversation to remain written and for us to find some kind of resolution this way.)
</p></blockquote><p>Thank you for jumping headlong into this conversation. Looking at our letters, the references on our sites, and the changes we've made (yes, I have been watching<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">wat</sup></button>) in virtue of our discussion, our practice has clearly been an investment in each other and ourselves.</p><p>It's a rare opportunity for me too! I've written long, crucial letters in my life, but I've not had a serious penpal.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">g</sup></button> It's a special kind of dialectic (I'd like to think Plato would enjoy our dialogue). Our words last, they resist the fading of more ephemeral communication (especially since we own our data), and they become embedded (to varying <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>) in ourselves and our sites. Assuming I live long enough to do so, I hope to read these words again decades from now, relive the conversation, &quot;be there&quot; again as best I can, and retell the representative story to myself of who are and were.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">i</sup></button> May I ponder this letter for a long time. Our words are treasure to me, constructive <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="diamonds.html">diamonds</a> and deconstructive <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="redpills.html">redpills</a>. I hope these conversations help comprise and evolve me. </p><p>The chance to respectfully (and playfully) converse at length, to know <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Other.html">The Other</a>, is part of what makes life worth living. In this case, falling into the flowstate to deepread and write feels like it generates a phenomenological space to be autonomous (a word I am Kantianly open to defining as Reason itself), to shape myself, to select and act on new principles, to see the world through another's eyes. I help construct myself in my dialectic with you; it is evidence and practice of who I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> to be. As you aptly put it, we <em>serialize</em> ourselves in this bond. I suggest the serialization process enables something far more than the mere translation of data structures. By externalizing the data structures of our self-models, we may be affording ourselves the opportunity to shape the very identities we are serializing. I'm convinced we have the opportunity to exercise a serious form of autonomy in this practice. We self-legislate and own ourselves by writing our narratives together.</p><p>Of course, I agree this medium has its limits, but from those limits emerge powerful properties which cannot be functionally reduced or duplicated by another medium. I am glad that you wish for this to remain written. Despite its slow construction and interpretation, I think long-form writing is the best of all mediums.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">fun</sup></button> Imho, writing affords us the chance to build ourselves in a unique way. I regret how the majority of my IRL interactions (thankfully not the ones that matter most to me) feel so disingenuous and shallow upon closer inspection (despite what I feel are my best efforts to penetrate these barriers). Our writing gives us a chance to engage in the science of making sure we don't develop merely a shallow relationship, and I love that. Authenticity (even in our relationships with others) to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, imho, is necessary for some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> of autonomy, even if it isn't sufficient.</p><p>Our writing not only resists fading, but I think it resists forgery and non-trivial confabulatory memory errors. This is crucial to one who believes we are always engaged in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> dialectics with ourselves and others (which is not the claim that our game is zero-sum!). As you know, I am a fairly distrusting person.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">fl</sup></button> Having been the virtual alien among humans most of my life, and having to cognitively reverse engineer (very poorly and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a>ingly!) the affective processes (and consequent cognitive results) in our variegated right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) activations, I have come to have little hope for the human species. I could be wrong, of course, and I hope I am proven wrong.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">d</sup></button> I despise my pessimistic predictions. Thank you for brightening my day. =)</p><p>I know my writing takes it out of me, and I'd be surprised if it didn't take it out of you (at least, I feel the weight in your words, thus I imagine so). The sheer effort of long-form writing is one of the reasons I trust it so much compared to the alternatives (and I'm fairly aware of how easily and often writing is misinterpreted; as you can see, I fail often). Of course, writing is a double-edged sword that has been wielded for great evil countless times. But, I remain convinced reciprocal long-form writing allows us to acquire trust in a profound way directly because we can examine these words, identities, and narratival experience machines with each other so carefully (I have had to read your words many times). That does not make writing failsafe obviously, but it's a worthy risk. It gives me sure, static footing in some cases; it is evidence.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, plenty of long-form interactions can be faked, gaslit, and abused, but it's harder on average to accomplish this in long-form writing exchanges than other mediums, imho (especially when people are watching). The more complex the universe, the harder it is to simulate it. Long-form writing may become the last stronghold of authentic remote communication. Consider, for example, how the turing test is a continually moving goal-post. Chatbots today already fool a non-trivial portion of the population. Voice and video fabrication becomes more realistic each year, and it already catches people who aren't looking for it off guard. We already verge on using the internet like nodes sifting through hyperreality of mere appearance, simulation, and recognition that there is nothing beneath a network of circular references. It is already common experience to legitimately question whether one is really interacting with another person across most mediums (and that problem is only going to get radically more manipulative over time). This kind of conversation, errors and all, feels real to me. Long-form writing is computationally heavy, and I think that makes it somewhat resistant to some deceptive threats.</p><p>I think your father may be right: a conversation [<strike>is</strike> may] be a <em>sacrament</em>. I do not take that word lightly. I grew up in a household in which we formally studied that word. You might consider it a term of art for me. <em>May <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">my</a> covenants live though my sacraments</em>. I believe I have found only one other solid opportunity to use the word in this wiki thus far, and that is in the core narrative of this wiki: {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}. As a somewhat skeptical man who has been burned alive by false belief, I am loath to wield that word with anything except the highest respect; I covet my faith until I am forced by conviction. Indeed, I am working towards the possibility of your father's sacrament in {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>}. I aim to be a wise wrestler in this practice because I really do hold meaningful conversation in high regard.</p><p>There is something genuine about our conversation which I prize. Thank you for taking our relationship so seriously; it is obvious to me that you are being kind, and it means a great deal to me. As an exercise of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>, we test each other, and I hope to pass yours with flying colors. =)</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>This correspondence has had about three major episodes from each of us. I saw this encounter as a foray into a 'pen pal' type thing - which is to say: 'informal', 'inconsequential' and 'probably frivolous'. (I hope you will let me say all three of those things in _good_ ways, very good ways. I also admire that you are reaching out through/with your autism to speak with me - I do worry about aggravating your own pain, of putting you under unreasonable expectations of my own and of not seeing the full picture of 'you' - who you are past 'h0p3'. But only if you need it - I would rather just see 'h0p3' for now - this creation is by design and I intend to take it in.) I don't feel that I want to 'wrestle' - I want to 'pen pal'. After all, this is a work of fiction. The contents of this letter are products of the reader's imagination. This letter is for entertainment purposes only. Although the form of this letter is autobiographical, it is not. Although this letter may appear authentic, it is not. What appears to be 'wrestling' may actually be a new type of sophisticated 'pal' engagement maneuver.
</p></blockquote><p>I really appreciate that you do not wish to aggravate my pain! Thank you.</p><p>Go ahead and take it in. I see you are thinking about my modeling arguments, and I hope you take seriously how literal I am with you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">mod</sup></button> Of course, I reckon this place is no accident, and I appreciate your intention. Yes, let's talk informally; I will try to move that direction (I will be unable to do so in some places in this letter). I don't think it's frivolous to speak about even frivolous things with you (srsly, we need to geek out more, homie). In time, I think we will become friends who can unstiffly code switch between the consequential and inconsequential at will (I <em>ferociously</em> guard the fragmented remains of the silly boy in me against the predators in our species). I aim to rapidly come to that understanding with you. We'll continue to tune our hermeneutical dials to hear each other correctly. </p><p>&quot;Well let me tell you something, brother,&quot; we need not wrestle hard, but I am convinced the dialectic is conceptually defined by wrestling (I'm relaxing, can't you see?). One cannot escape the practice (though it can be modified enormously). I think you wrestle with yourself and me even when you aren't aware of it. Of course, sometimes you have to seriously take life less seriously, whatever that means.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pe</sup></button> As my brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> does, please forgive me for being a shitty mean wrestler. I will do my best to tone it down! I've been told I'm an absurdly serious man who is too honest on many occasions. Of course, there are ways to engage in relaxed wrestling and leisurely discussion. That will be my goal with you. Swearsie realsies,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sr</sup></button> just in case, our highlightable safeword will be: &quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://china-il.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dean</a>&quot; unless you prefer &quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://adultswim.wikia.com/wiki/Hank_Venture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hank</a>&quot; (you can ship 'em if you want).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Now, I am not an intellectual by any stretch - I have idea no who Kierkegaard is and I can't keep Kant and Hume straight.
</p></blockquote><p>Of course, that is no excuse (I am such an elitist asshole! I know). There are some memeplexes which we are all morally obligated to understand as best we can. I am going to literally take you at your word here. Here is my unguarded advice to the romantic nomad newly wandering that part of the desert (which, again, I have a deeply flawed understanding of):</p><p>Trace <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Great%2520Human%2520Conversation.html">The Great Human Conversation</a>, and you will see Saint Kant has enchanted The Vortex, and no one has escaped the illusion unscathed. Descartes planted a seed of doubt, inverting the primacy of the ontic-epistemic relationship, but Kant cultivated it into a Copernican Revolution in human thought. Kant is worth everyone ounce of your effort. A thousand times I thought I knew what he was saying, and thousand times I was wrong. I'm probably still wrong.</p><p>Saint Kierkegaard screams and weeps to us. I beg you pay attention to my teacher. He brings to life the meaning of fiction, and I suggest it will be a crucial framework for interpreting what you mean by &quot;fire.&quot;  </p><p>Hume is a vile monster and a truly dangerous opponent (study the dark arts carefully, sir); he will either wake you from your dogmatic slumber to a horrifying world or, even worse, he'll seal you into one you don't wake from. I see his arguments wielded to convenient psychopathy quite often. We must all answer to this great adversary of Humanity. Hypocritical though he may be, he is a grandmaster accuser, reducer, and skeptic; I have been lucky to pass through his maze alive thus far. His memeplexes are profoundly damaging when misused; he is a skeptical artist constructing with radioactive material.</p><p>I hope that will be of use to you (other learned people will have very different reality maps of this desert). I also appreciate your humility. I don't care if you are an intellectual (I have a lot to say on this topic); I care that you use your intelligence to be wise. Having been so unwise myself, I have seen that not all pursuits of wisdom are equal. Being philosophical matters; I am putting my money where my mouth is here, even if I'm broke as fuck.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I do read a lot - fiction by a wide margin. I do read Vygotsky and Piaget and, sometimes, Jung. Of all the philosophers, I am most fond of Socrates - and feel a brotherhood with you through him. But the writers that I spend my time on are fiction writers - Albert 'Vigoleis' Thelen is someone I speak to in my mind very often. To call out to him: 'Vigoleis' when I see his place in the world. Denton Welch and Robert Walser are like this for me. But even these closest - I cannot speak intellectually about them, only romantically.
</p></blockquote><p>It is obvious to me that you are more well-read than I am. I have a hard time believing you aren't an intellectual (:= one who consistently intellectualizes). I am truly low-brow in art (excepting some lotteries I've won, I also fit the poverty demographic profile in many respects); I know little of high art. I do value <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Beautiful.html">The Beautiful</a>, even if I am not virtuous in my pursuit of it. I have almost no experience with those authors. I will appreciate when you connect the dots for me here because I'm way out of my league.</p><p>I've never even heard of 'Vigoleis.' It's not my goal to be uncultured swine; I just am. I will work to remedy that. Will it be worth my time to read <em>The Island of Second Sight</em>? I would like to know how you call him out; I see many philosophers screaming out of the world at me (I regularly have to ask some of them to be quiet...if I'm not screaming back, lol).</p><p>I try my best to appreciate romanticism (which I see as a tool only of last resort), even though I lack that skill. I take it up in faith that at some limit we can only ever romantically point to the transcendent, and whatever <em>it</em> is can never (by logical definition) be fully expressed in finite computation. Yet, we must place our tentpegs down very wisely in the desert. I think of my work as trying to safely take me fairly close to the limits of rationality in my context (which is not the claim that it's significantly or sufficiently rational) so that I may have the clearest vision of and right to romantically point to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> in my context (a non-trivial portion of my teachers have gone insane trying to express this thing, and I hope to guard myself against that as well).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>So yes - I think you want to have a philosophical debate with me, but I am not equipped to do it.

I am morally obligated to wrestle with you on this point, sir. I will do so as kindly as I can. (I think this is the point in story at which I'm supposed to ritualistically bow to you or something, right? ;P)</p><p>Philosophy is the study of wisdom, of salient truth. It is an essential purpose of all persons to engage in philosophy as effectively as they can (and I consider myself to have a fairly broad notion of philosophy, though not all philosophical methods or pursuits are equal to me).

Perhaps you are doing it right now.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">air</sup></button> There is some wisest way (or set of equally permissible ways) for you to maximize the wisdom with which you engage your life. That is not the claim that I know what it is or how to do this well. What is objectively salient does scale to the particulars of each of our contexts. It appears that pursuing wisdom to live wisely requires being virtuously philosophical in both theory and practice.</p><p>Not all facts, pursuits, and perspectives are equal; we must seek what is most objectively salient in our context. If there is a choice between reading Kant+Kierkegaard+Hume and me, I beg you read these <em>grandmasters</em> instead of me.</p><p>More importantly: we are all morally accountable for our ambitions. Perhaps your ambitions are more morally worthy than reading those guys. I am not in a position to make that final judgment (although, I must still model you). In my experience, virtuous reasoning about such a judgment requires wrestling with what my teachers have written about. I think you do something unwise by not pursuing their wisdom. I hope you give this issue another hard look. If I am unjustifiably dogmatic here, I beg you teach me why with the best argument you can provide. But, here you must ask whether or not you really want to wrestle.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I don't think you want to have this discussion unless I am an equipped intellectual.

It's pretty hard for me to clearly and succinctly describe to you what I think this discussion really is and what I want out of it all the way down (as usual, there is an interpretation of your question which may be equivalent to an instance of the fundamental question in philosophy itself).

</p></blockquote><p>Agreed. I appreciate your willingness to flesh it out. I am deeply concerned with justice as fairness in the desert, though I am often wrong.

Negotiation and affective empathy between us, therefore, is not automated (we do not share enough implicit affective memetics to take these shortcuts with each other). Unfortunately, this means we must intentionally use our frontal lobes, our slower (single-thread oriented) but highly generalized CPUs, to cognitively reconstruct and translate those protocols.

A whirlwind of details about trajectories and cover-ups. But if you listened for an hour, you could finally she her - and her sorrow. It wasn't disgusting or repulsive - but familiar and natural. Just a sorrow - as plain as a pleasantness.</p><p>I wanted to show her something in the yard, so I motioned for her to cross the gutter - which is quite wide and was rushing with water - it's more of a canal than a gutter.

I realized that she was wearing flip-flops and trying to avoid some spiky weeds. I held out both hands - I probably shouldn't have tried to persuade her - I don't know, I began to pull her across and she kind of panicked and made a squeal!

There is an extent to which my message and identity exist in virtue of it.

Acknowledgement, to some degree, appears necessary in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> conversational train. I regret that I am a very poor practitioner in this respect. I do not trust myself to provide the necessary &quot;acks&quot; to others where they predict them, and more importantly, where they deserve them. Hence, this is one cause for my annoying tendency to quote and respond to everything. I assume when others bypass this process, they have an excellent reason that I do not see, that they have understood what I've said and jumped to the next move (as though they were my teacher). You might not realize how poorly I model your mind; the 'acks' verify my cognitive Bayesian reasoning about you (I don't get to rely upon the instinctual, gutteral conversation tools you might naturally rely upon with neurotypicals).</p><p>Even in a real life conversation with me, when I agree or believe I understand, you will often hear me say to you, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;mmhhmmmm&quot; or &quot;alright&quot; or any number of differentiable tokens that give you an indication of how to shape what you are about to say in a useful way for us.

My rule with my own children in our dialectics is that they must respond with either an agreement or a disagreement at every obvious breakpoint or major proposition in our conversations (they are some fierce children). It is how we peel everything apart, compatibilize ourselves, and constructively shape the conversation with a good foundation. Isolating the disagreement is crucial to solving it. If they agree to something which is new, important, unintuitive, generally unaccepted, or odd, then I beg them to provide an example or walk me through how they understand it. If they disagree, then they must give me an argument and be prepared to be wrong (they regularly correct me too). If we do not build a solid foundation, then our work will sometimes be in vain.

It's what makes psychopaths so effective in emotional manipulation. An autist, however, is literally incapable of that empathy in the first place, but if they have the resources, sometimes they can cognitively come to reverse engineer the affective process enough to eventually mirror/model your emotional states with sufficient accuracy and speed.
