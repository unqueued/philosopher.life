THU 11:28 AM
Doing good ‚Äîfinished homeschool math with an A! Now working our way through English
THU 1:01 PM
Noice. Your niece is lucky to have you. =)
THU 1:02 PM
Concert was great! It was sold out so I didn‚Äôt get to see it all but it had a symphony which was awesome and was more Sinatra Christmas than strictly religious
THU 1:03 PM
Awesome. Sorry you didn't get to see it all, but a symphony sounds wonderful.
THU 1:03 PM
Awww she‚Äôs a good kid. I don‚Äôt think mom and dad sit with her to get it done ‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs mostly on her. Not many 14 yr olds are that motivated
THU 1:04 PM
I, uh, know that pain.
THU 1:04 PM
lol
THU 1:04 PM
I am a terrible motivator. I can explain and justify, but I am not rhetorically convincing enough.
THU 1:05 PM
Unfortunately, emotional nudging and manipulation are far more powerful tools than reason for influence.
THU 1:05 PM
Sometimes just sitting and reading/modeling reasoning is good motivation
THU 1:06 PM
I hope to build a bridge which inverts that with my children, where reason becomes the thing which motivates and structures their perceptions more than anything else (a high calling, and I do not claim to have succeeded in it myself).
THU 1:06 PM
Sometimes, aye.
THU 1:06 PM
I would argue I spend a great deal of time doing that with my chillun. I see the limits often.
THU 1:07 PM
Your kids will have an awesome education. Wish more kids could have that
THU 1:09 PM
Me too. I work toward it. It is difficult to convince people what even counts as education, let alone the purposes of one. It is one of my goals as a citizen.
THU 1:10 PM
My afterschool program makes me feel unhopeful about it, lol. I am still listening and thinking about it.
THU 1:10 PM
We've been screwing around basically the entire time I've been there, but it was the end of the semester.
THU 1:11 PM
Education is often difficult because the ones that are making the decisions are often not educators themselves and are motivated by other things like $
THU 1:11 PM
No doubt.
THU 1:11 PM
Having issues with the current governor here because he is really pushing charter schools not because he believes in better education but because he is associated with the group that sets them up. So taking money from public schools to put in his pocket basically
THU 1:13 PM
I am not convinced even the teachers themselves are educated. They average 7 IQ points lower than the average college graduate. Their are no critical reasoning improvements to Education majors (business and communication majors have the same problem). The best teachers are those who major in the subject without a doubt.
THU 1:13 PM
That is profound corruption.
THU 1:14 PM
The commodification of education and information is a profound evil. It is a tyranny. It destroys democracy. It produces slaves.
THU 1:14 PM
The centralization of power continues to grow out of control.
THU 1:15 PM
Maybe with January you can contact some of the teachers to see what specifically they need help with and do it your own way
THU 1:15 PM
I may. From what I've seen, they hold their status in high regard.
THU 1:16 PM
I don't think they know what the kids actually need either =/.
THU 1:16 PM
Or even better ...listen to the kids... some of these kids have issues at home that make education take a back seat. Maybe if they recognized that education can be a way out...
THU 1:16 PM
I love that you have a heart for these kids. They will recognize that
THU 1:19 PM
Even with my own children, I explain that education exists to transform them. It is not clear to me that it will be instrumentally valuable to their ability to thrive in capitalism. I've already lost the war if I teach my students that the point of an education is be  able to signal to employers that they are useful. The notion that education is valuable because it gets one a job is profoundly mistaken. I agree it can be instrumental there, but it cannot be ultimate reason one aims to be educated. From the numbers, even poor kids who are educated do not fare well in our economy. Upward mobility is a myth.
THU 1:20 PM
I hope so! =)
THU 1:21 PM
Both of our households show that education is not a way to riches... but! If they can‚Äôt read or reason, they definitely will be manipulated by the system and not to their benefit
THU 1:24 PM
Preach. =)
THU 1:24 PM
:heart:ü•∞
THU 1:24 PM
It is a necessary condition to our political and perhaps even metaphysical autonomy.
THU 1:24 PM
Yes!
THU 1:25 PM
It is no accident that &quot;Liber&quot; means both reading/book and freedom.
THU 1:25 PM
True dat
THU 1:29 PM
So the way out is not necessarily money but a mind that can see what is actually going on around them (by reason/reading) and not being an uneducated sheep
THU 1:31 PM
:sheep:
THU 1:31 PM
Aye. It is necessary even if it isn't remotely sufficient. It is the only chance to decentralize power in the material dialectic. Otherwise, we are lambs (or pigs) to the slaughter.
THU 1:33 PM
Your timely use of hieroglyphs is something I'm considering practicing. I want to be able to write in them fluently.
THU 1:34 PM
:scream::clap::raised_hands::clap::raised_hands::clap:
THU 1:35 PM
Lol =)
THU 1:35 PM
I :clap: love :clap: this :clap: clapping :clap: meme!
THU 1:36 PM
Ok I am off to get the foodage for the kidlets. Today‚Äôs grub is Mexican! :taco:
THU 1:36 PM
delicioso, enjoy
