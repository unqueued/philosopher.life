<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>Hey dude. I know today's the day. I am here to listen.
WED 3:43 PM
I hope it goes well.
WED 3:43 PM</code></pre><p>I called my brother up. Apparently, he called last night, but it still didn't go through. I wish I knew; I know he could use someone to listen to him. I was lucky enough to be able to listen today.</p><p>He walked me through the courtroom trial. Raylan (he corrected me for going too &quot;lin&quot; before, but now it is too &quot;lan&quot; ‚Äì I will find the right middleground soon enough!), was an added on case. Their departure was heartbreaking. The boy wouldn't even let my brother give him a kiss goodbye, said he wouldn't cry about it, etc. Of course, he had no idea what he was saying, and my brother knew that. It was a painful day. That boy is a billion times better off because they helped him, even though he'll never know it. </p><p>My brother's boss is an asshole. That goes for both my brothers. Capitalism and people in general suck. =(</p><p>My brother was interested in my new friend. We talked a bit. </p><p>My brother is very sleepy. He can feel the depression, and wants his meds upped to max. I'm hoping that the pain will start to pass some here. I think the freedom will do him a lot of good; he could use a breath of fresh air from the surface (he's been drowning for a while). There is another hurdle with Rebecca, and I suppose a lot of how things play out rest upon her shoulders here.</p></div>
