TUE 12:55 PM
It goes. Started a new Netflix show: The Haunting of Hill House. It‚Äôs probably not something you‚Äôd care for. Haha. I like it a lot though. Apparently there are hidden ghosts in the background of scenes and it‚Äôs really fun to try to spot them.
TUE 12:58 PM
googling
TUE 12:59 PM
Nice.
TUE 1:00 PM
Would you like me to watch it with you?
TUE 1:00 PM
It‚Äôs got some pretty unsettling imagery. Not sure it‚Äôs your cup of tea. Haha. But if you‚Äôd like to check it out when we come down that would be fun!
TUE 1:00 PM
Cool. Hey, when are you guys able to come down?
TUE 1:01 PM
(you don't have to know, any dates are good for me)
TUE 1:01 PM
Looking at Jan 2nd and leaving on the 4th or 5th.
TUE 1:02 PM
If that‚Äôs okay we will make it official. :)

Will probably invite [[JRE]] to tag along too.
TUE 1:02 PM
Also- in case you didn‚Äôt know Neo Yokio season 2 comes out Friday IIRC
TUE 1:03 PM
Double checking with the boss. Those dates are guaranteed good for you to come over. I cannot guarantee [[k0sh3k]] and I won't be required to work on those days (we do not have a choice in the matter).
TUE 1:06 PM
I can guarantee that weekends are the most free for us.
TUE 1:07 PM
My work is short though, 2-6ish. And, my offspring will be home (they are reasonable hosts ;P).
TUE 1:08 PM
I did not know that about Neo Yokio. I am very excited!
TUE 1:10 PM
Would you like me to hold off on watching it, and we can watch it together?
TUE 1:10 PM
We‚Äôre booked pretty solid all the way through the holiday. :joy: I don‚Äôt mind hanging with the kids while you guys work though. I know it isn‚Äôt ideal. We can try to figure something else out if you have any ideas.
TUE 1:14 PM
Feel free to watch it! We‚Äôll probably wait until we see you guys to watch it. :)
TUE 1:15 PM
Heard back from [[k0sh3k]]. She is actually out of town on the 3-4th for a church commitment. It would be the 5-6 of us instead of the 6-7 of us (which is still awesome).
TUE 1:22 PM
I‚Äôll talk to [[L]] and see if we can shift back a day. January 3rd and leave on the 5th or 6th. Does that sound like a better compromise?
TUE 1:25 PM
Would probably the morning of the 6th so we have Friday and Saturday for sure. Right at the weekend. :)
TUE 1:26 PM
Sorry. Scheduling is tough. Haha.
TUE 1:26 PM
No, you are being truly generous to us to travel to see us.
TUE 1:26 PM
It wouldn‚Äôt feel right to not see you guys during the holiday. :)
TUE 1:27 PM
I know!
TUE 1:27 PM
[[L]] seems complacent with going from Jan 3-6. We can guarantee Saturday with this window. :)
WED 8:47 AM
We probably will leave early on Sunday.
