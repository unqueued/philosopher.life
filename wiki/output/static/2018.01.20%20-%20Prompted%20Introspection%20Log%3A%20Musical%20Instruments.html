<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What musical instrument(s) do you play or wish you could play?</h2><p>Define music, then define musical instrument. Is music that which lights our brain up in a particular way? Must it be transmitted through sound waves? Can something not musical become musical for me? Is it a matter of dissonance and pattern recognition, being surprised in the right way? Music for whom? I cannot define this thing.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2019.03.23</sup></button> </p><p>I played Piano for about a decade, from 9 to 19. I didn't really practice hard until later, but it tapered off. My crowning achievements were Rachmaninoff pieces. I've played many keyboards, including for church accompaniment. I have a nice digital keyboard for producing music on a computer. One day, I would like to become adept with it.</p><p>I've played lots of silly instruments, like ocarinas, flutes, recorders, mouth harps, harmonicas, percussion instruments of many kinds, etc. They are toy instruments and complements. Trinkets aren't very musical for me because they aren't expressive enough.</p><p>I started clarinet at 10 and played until I was 13. I was an excellent clarinetist playing with national champion marching bands. My teachers were fairly good (surprising for Kentucky). I almost never practiced because piano did all the work for me; tone was the only hard part. The girls who competed with me hated me because I didn't practice the clarinet, but I feel like I put my time in on piano.</p><p>In graduate school, I picked up the guitar and banjo decently enough. The ukulele and violin did not suit me, although I tried.</p><p>The funny part is that now I just blast Pandora. I don't even care. I just want the beautiful noise and the rare moments where the music owns me (harder and harder to come by). </p><p>I wish I could play music that made me happy, that made me passionate. I'm pretty spoiled from having been drowned in this drug for so long that I have a hard time achieving musical orgasm now. Music just is a part of passing the time of my existence. =)</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2019.03.23 : </span> This may be a predecessor to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Music.html">Music</a>.</sub></p></div>
