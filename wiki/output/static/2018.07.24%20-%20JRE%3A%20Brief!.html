<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I briefly talked to my brother today. We didn't seem to have much to say. He was entertaining company, and he was having trouble with his USB 3.0 PCI card for his VR sensors (he's probably going to replace it because that 3.0 speed is valuable throughput in this case...it's curious that it works only some of the time). </p><p>I told him I was relieved to have finally gotten sound to work in i3-manjaro (it took me days, sadly). </p><p>He thought it was Sunday because he wasn't working that day. He jumped into asking about our family time, and I tried to go with the flow on his phrasing (since I wasn't quite sure if he knew what he said, but I didn't think it was worth investigating). </p><p>My brother JRE took Monday off to be with his friends. I do not always understand his reasoning of how he takes days off. I'm glad he is thinking about how to invest his time. </p><p>I asked my wife about this, and she says something isn't normal about him. She said it feels a bit like he's distancing from many of his deeper relationships that he has previously put a lot of investment into. I don't know if this is true or not in all directions (although, I agree to some). I am still worried about my brother. As long as he doesn't feel alone, it will be okay (I hope!).</p></div>
