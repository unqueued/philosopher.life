<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">If your best friend came to you depressed and upset like you've never seen before, how would you react?</h2><p>My best friends have come to me depressed. In fact, I'm often the one who is thinking alongside them, trying to understand it. They do the same for me. I take it to be my goal to empathize with them, feel their feelings, see their point of view, and attempt to find functional responses. I do my best not to be judgmental (which, as you know, is borderline impossible for me). </p><p>If they were more depressed than I've ever seen, they'd probably be on the verge of ending their lives. I'd drop whatever I was doing to be with them. I would plead with them. I would remind them, reason with them, and attempt to give them hope.</p><p>Admittedly, I'm probably really bad at this. In fact, from what I can tell, my point of view is often a catalyst or reagent for despair and depression. I'm constantly forcing us to look in the existential mirror. </p><p>This reminds me of my cousin L. In the end, she does not want to face up to the fact that she has spent 5 hard years of her life prepping to be a psychopath. She knowingly works in a machine that kills thousands of people a year, lobbying to maximize their profits and prevent single-payer healthcare, etc. She doesn't try escape it, and she hasn't made serious moves to not be committing evils acts. Obviously, I say it much more indirectly and kindly to her. She has stopped talking to me, which is her choice. In the end, someone has to tell her the truth.</p></div>
