<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Is the good will important for morality, and it what ways?</p><p>How important are intentions for morality? Is it merely about doing the right thing, or does motive matter?</p><p>What is the key concept of morality? What is morality really about?</p><p>Is it really true that only a good will is unconditionally good?</p><p>Our mission (should we take it):</p><p>What are his questions, what does he want?</p><p>What is his argument?</p><p>Is he successful?</p><p>Dr. Sensen said he had a sore neck today because he spent so much time ‚ÄòNodding‚Äô his head while reading Kant this morning.</p><p>What is the first section of Ground for? What is its purpose?</p><p>This is a formulation of what we believe morality is from our common cognition/sense of morality to the supreme principle (CI). This is a formulation, not a justification.</p><p>He goes from motivation to content of the principle. What is this way in between?</p><p>4:390, Cannot just conform to the moral law, it must be for the sake of the moral law.</p><p>Do the right thing (conform to the moral law)</p><p>Do it for the right reason - simply because it is right (for the sake of the moral law)</p><p>4:393, This is a negative argument. A list of things which are ruled out. But, it also has to give some positive aspects of the good will.</p><p>4:394, That nature made us and everything, this is a stoic view of his time. Scratch it out. The appendix doesn‚Äôt have a purpose, but he would have thought there was one.</p><p>4:397, a holy being can‚Äôt be necessitated (can‚Äôt be required or obligated). One must be tempted or inclined to not do the right thing in order to be necessitated.</p><p>An action can deserve praise and encouragement, but it isn‚Äôt unconditionally good if you don‚Äôt do it from duty. (This is the first, unspkoken proposition)</p><p>4:402, Gives us the principle from the propositions.</p><p>What is odd is that he starts looking for pure, non-empirical morality. But, then he starts with common, empirical thoughts about morality. This isn‚Äôt a contradiction ‚Äì he‚Äôs trying to juice our intuitions.</p><p>Law of double effect ‚Äì intention matters. But, it seems like we could do wrong things with the right intention.</p><p>Scanlon, your house is on fire, only way to get water is to goto neighbors house to get the water, even though are forbidden. The intention doesn‚Äôt matter. What justifies him is just the excusing circumstance. He could have intended to see the person‚Äôs yard, even though he‚Äôs not supposed to, even though the secondary effect is getting water for your house (which seems like you should).</p><p>Strawson, on the bus, guys steps on your hand.If he apologizes and explains it wasn‚Äôt on purpose, you react differently from if he laughs and asks if you want another one (and did it on purpose).</p><p>Only intentions matters?</p><p>Do you agree the good will is the only good will?</p><p>Do I agree with his examples?</p><p>Regarding the necessity of having the right motivation for the right action, can you choose your motivation? Is that a kind of action (albeit a mental kind of action)? If so, does the CI obligate us to be motivated by respect for the moral law in all choices.</p><p>406-408:</p><p>We never know our own motivation.</p><p>What if you are 80% motivated by respect for the moral law, but 20% motivated because it benefits you? Degrees of right and wrong, blameworthiness, and motivation. Would Kant be open to degrees of merit?</p><p>I think he has a lot of work to show why the good will is the only absolute, primary, and unconditional good. It seems like Kant really has his work cut out for him to show why it has primacy over eudaimonia or happiness, where it seems as though the good will is both an end, but also a means to happiness, whereas happiness seems to be merely an end in itself and never a means. How is happiness conditionally good?</p><p>Why is the good will unconditionally good?</p><p>Final end ‚Äì happiness is an example. Seeking it for its own sake.</p><p>Happiness is something you naturally want. You can‚Äôt be necessitated. Thus, it isn‚Äôt a moral problem? Like Holy things.</p><p>Kant thinks happiness is narrow, it is merely desire satisfaction.</p><p>Good will is unconditional but not complete.</p><p>Freedom, obligation, duty, categorical imperative.</p><p>Our ability to achieve happiness is conditional, but why is happiness conditionally good? Maybe it isn‚Äôt even my personal happiness, but general happiness.</p><p>Morality is what you ought to do independent of desires.</p><p>What is value for Kant?</p><p>Why is the Utility Rule not universalizable?</p><p>What is value?</p><p>Think of the ancients:</p><p>‚ÄúX is good‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúX has value‚Äù</p><p>It isn‚Äôt clear where Kant stands on this. This is controversial.</p><p>Do what is right, the content of which is fleshed out by a principle (the CI)</p><p>Do what is right BECAUSE it is right</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt need to be the highest, complete good. It would be better if they were happy.</p><p>For our purposes, Kant thinks good=worth=value=worth, at least as he uses them as terms (for the most part, I guess).</p><p>Functional aspect is contingent.</p><p>Not everyone has a good will (6:463), but even these people deserve respect. Goodness and value is not why I should respect another human being.</p><p>Value positions:</p><p>There is no value. Naturalism would posit this.</p><p>Subjectivism</p><p>Constructivism (it is something that we as a group construct and agree upon)</p><p>Moral realism</p><p>Value descriptions</p><p>No value</p><p>Whatever we do value</p><p>Subjective</p><p>Constructive</p><p>Property</p><p>Relational (X is taller than Y; X is better than Y)</p><p>Is useful for*</p><p>Is fitting</p><p>Intrinsic</p><p>Normal moral realism</p><p>Value Prescription</p><p>An utterance of what you should value, not a description of a thing or what someone else does value. It is a command of what you should value. (Think of prescriptivism ‚Äì bullying/influencing others to think the same way I do)</p><p>Pure reason (KANT)</p><p>Moral Realist Side:</p><p>Jewel passage, 394</p><p>Ground of CI, 428</p><p>The highest judge, 439 (intrinsic)</p><p>Prescriptivist Side:</p><p>435-6 (Values of things other than the law come from the law)</p><p>5:63</p><p>5:64</p><p>What is value? What is valuable? What tells us what is valuable?</p><p>Good is what reasons prescribes as practically necessary.</p><p>Good = what reason deems necessary</p><p>Good is only to be said of actions, never of a thing, 5:60. Good is not a property of objects.</p><p>Absolute/inner/unconditional (same things) value, 5:62 = judgment abstracts from all conditions.</p><p>Actions get there value from the CI. The CI dictates that these actions are valuable.</p><p>428, Instead of thinking that value must be the foundation of the law, the relationship is the other way around. If you have a law, then you have value. If no value exists, then no law. This is an epistemic relationship in trying to figure out ‚Äúif there is a law.‚Äù</p><p>Is reason good? Is the CI good? Howso? What makes them good?</p><p>5:39-40‚Ä¶.</p><p>5:58, If you have a prior conception of value, you don‚Äôt get absolute value.</p><p>5:62-3, ‚Äú‚Äù‚Ä¶you won‚Äôt get a moral law.</p><p>5:58,</p><p>If you have a prior conception of value</p><p>It would be the agreeable, a feeling of pleasure, something which is contingent and subjective</p><p>‚ÄòGood‚Äô is a means to the agreeable</p><p>Nothing is absolutely good, only as a means to the agreeable</p><p>you don‚Äôt get absolute value.</p><p>5:52</p><p>5:62-3,</p><p>If value is prior,</p><p>Criterion pleasure</p><p>Based on experience</p><p>then you won‚Äôt get a priori moral law.</p><p>Must one explicitly employ the CI, or can one implicitly employ it? I often make deductions that aren‚Äôt conscious.</p><p>5:8n ‚Äì It can be implicit.</p><p>What distinguishes morality from other areas is that it is unconditionally binding.</p><p>Universality isn‚Äôt so hard to swallow, it is the necessitation that is difficult.</p><p>Not making exceptions for yourself ‚Äì that is part of the universality.</p><p>Nichols, moral/conventional distinction (about 39 months), Kant clearly isn‚Äôt showing us something new. Now, is our belief innate, conditioned, or what? I don‚Äôt know.</p><p>Even animals seem to have this distinction (although, psychopaths don‚Äôt).</p><p>How much Reason is required to be bound by the CI? Is rationality modal/binary, or it is on a gradation?</p><p>Necessity</p><p>Psychological compulsion? Blackburn, for example. Feelings can be categorical‚Ä¶Nothing can feel more categorical than some of your feelings in certain circumstances. E.g. if you had to save your sweetheart before others, that would feel categorical. It would undermine Kant‚Äôs claim‚Ä¶</p><p>Kant‚Äôs not talking about it though. It is conditional ?? It is binding on others to save your sweetheart. 5:26. Physiological necessity and compellation.</p><p>Logical ‚Äì Particularly in the sense of Grammar/Language Structure</p><p>Also not Kant‚Äôs view. Not about the grammar structure. 4:419.</p><p>Should I take the train? ‚ÄúDo it‚Äù isn‚Äôt categorical. Why it is ‚Äòbinding‚Äô on you if you want to be on London on time.</p><p>Justification by reason</p><p>If reason holds it be necessary/valid, independently of any conditions..5:31</p><p>There is a necessity, in a sense, in the hypothetical imperative. ‚ÄúIF you want X, then you must do Y</p><p>‚Äù‚Ä¶Y is necessary for X.</p><p>CI</p><p>Bindingness</p><p>5:21</p><p>4:21</p><p>4:25</p><p>6:225</p><p>Content</p><p>402</p><p>421</p><p>5:27</p><p>Action = Principle + End</p><p>= ‚ÄúI need to study‚Äù + ‚ÄúGraduate from school‚Äù</p><p>Motviation: inclinations can‚Äôt be your end. 5:26, 4:441.</p><p>Suicide: Man with rabies, the President about to be captured with state secrets‚Ä¶permissible, maybe even obligated‚Ä¶not allowed for the man who just</p><p>The lying case.</p><p>Problems:</p><p>CI is empty. It is devoid of content. Perhaps without content you can‚Äôt get concrete action.</p><p>But, doesn‚Äôt the maxim supply the concrete thing we need?</p><p>Rules too much; rules out everything ‚Äì premoral (unlike 5).</p><p>Rules out too little</p><p>Specific maxims...</p><p>Rules it out for the wrong reasons</p><p>Because a contradiction occurs‚Ä¶why does it point out any moral features.</p><p>I think because logic is normative, morally normative</p><p>Too absolutist (Lying); deontology</p><p>I need a diagram.</p><p>Someone has inclination, they form an end, then they are conscious enough to ask if it is universalizable. Content comes from your inclinations and proposed ends. This defeats the emptiness problem (1).</p><p>Self others</p><p>Perfect Suicide lying</p><p>Imperfect Talents Helping</p><p>Inclination</p><p>Thought experiment (imagine everyone has the same maxim/end)</p><p>Contradiction</p><p>In Conception</p><p>Perfect</p><p>Just imagining that if everyone had the maxim, you must reach a contradiction in conception.</p><p>Lying, if everyone is lying, then everyone will know that everyone lies, and thus is defeats the purpose of lying.</p><p>Suicide, out of self love you want to end your life, and self love propels the furtherance of life, end life contradicts your self life.</p><p>In Will</p><p>Imperfect</p><p>Whoever wills the ends also wills the means‚Ä¶</p><p>It isn‚Äôt about anything in particular that you will, wish, or have as an end ?? It isn‚Äôt about the consequences.</p><p>Moral content of CI is not to make an exception of yourself.</p><p>It is not logical contradiction, it is logical inconsistency.</p><p>Specificity of Maxims: 5:19‚Ä¶.contains many practical rules.</p><p>In what cases, if any, can or should a person kill another?</p><p>Korsgaard:</p><p>Key argument 122-123, important argument 120, and 109 we are going to need.</p><p>109:</p><p>1st ‚Äì there must be an unconditional, absolute end</p><p>2nd- Humanity is that end‚Ä¶</p><p>Why is human an uncondtional, absolute end</p><p>You start out with something familiar, then you ask back how this is possible, then you come back and realize that humanity is an end.</p><p>Relative ends -&gt; hypothetical imperatives</p><p>End in itself -&gt; categorical imperative</p><p>End in itself seems to be the ground of the categorical imperative.</p><p>Regress argument- on 122-123</p><p>Things have conditional value</p><p>Moral realists might not like it. Aristotelians might not like this.</p><p>Reason seek the unconditioned</p><p>The unconditioned condition is rational nature</p><p>Rational nature can confer value only if it has unconditioned value</p><p>Other rational natures value too</p><p>Rational nature has unconditional value</p><p>Just because your finger can mark something doesn‚Äôt mean your finger is marked as such.</p><p>The equivocation between humanity and rationality doesn‚Äôt make sense.</p><p>These are different:</p><p>end in itself</p><p>Absolute value</p><p>Dignity</p><p>Good ÔÉ† Right‚Ä¶..or‚Ä¶..Right ÔÉ† Good</p><p>Kant thinks Right-&gt;Good</p><p>4:435-6, 5:62-3</p><p>393, 6:463, everyone should be respected, even those without a good will and criminals</p><p>6:239, you can claim a right from others by reminding him of his duty,</p><p>These are reasons he starts with the right and not the good.</p><p>6:449-450</p><p>4:436, 437-8, 5:87</p><p>Respect</p><p>Recognition</p><p>Appraisal (merit)</p><p>Maxim we should have</p><p>Why does your principle of reason command you to respect other persons? Not because they have intrinsic good in themselves.</p><p>CI: Don‚Äôt make an exception of yourself 4:425</p><p>Formula of Humanity: don‚Äôt exalt yourself 6:450</p><p>-426-429</p><p>End in itself = freedom</p><p>Human beings, in virtue of freedom, arenot merely a plaything in nature (a means). They direct themselves, they are ends in themselves.</p><p>Dignity plays no role in why person deserve respect.</p><p>Freedom (end in itself) grounds the CI</p><p>6:380-2, our own perfection and the happiness of others.</p><p>382:</p><p>respect for person</p><p>you don‚Äôt want to be used or treated as a mere means</p><p>autonomy</p><p>you don‚Äôt want to be dependent upon others, you want to govern yourself</p><p>dignity</p><p>you don‚Äôt want to be lowered or demeaned, you want to hold your head up high</p><p>Respect ‚Äì a maxim of not exalting yourself ‚Äì 6:449:50</p><p>Respect is not a feeling of esteem or reverence (6:467-8). You don‚Äôt owe esteem to other people. You just owe esteem to the moral law. It is a maxim you should have of not thinking of yourself that is better than others.</p><p>4:431 ‚Äì given by pure reason</p><p>What about MLK Jr. I think he might be a better person than me. Does he not have more dignity. How do we know if he is better than me or not. 6:434-6, false humility. If MLK did have thatfeeling of better, it would destroy the idea that is he actually dignified. 4:406-408. We can‚Äôt know where we are. Moral luck might also be a factor, for example. There isn‚Äôt a way to make a judgment because we don‚Äôt know our own motives. We have everything that counts, and that is why we don‚Äôt have to lower ourself.</p><p>4:437-8, 5:87 ‚Äì formulas are equivalent.</p><p>4:436, 436 ‚Äì formula of humanity is introduced, bringing it closer to intuition</p><p>6:443, 4:428 ‚Äì we don‚Äôt have a direct duty toward animals, but we do have it toward human. So, isn‚Äôt there something special about human beings. You shouldn‚Äôt be cruel to animals because you shouldn‚Äôt adopt an attitude of cruelty, but not because the animal has any right. But, we don‚Äôt owe anything to other human beings either (directly), but rather we should just be a certain sort of person, and it just so happens that that duty (to revere the moral law) contains the respect of other human beings.</p><p>To respect other humans beings just IS to obey the moral law.</p><p>To claim a right doesn‚Äôt point to a value he has, but he reminds the agent to follow the categorical imperative.</p><p>6:393, just because someone demands something of you doesn‚Äôt generate a right or claim, it only does if you grant it, if you see that it is fit for a universal moral law.</p><p>5:62-63, paradox of method</p><p>I asked if it is the goal to habituate our inclinations to the point that we are no longer necessitates. Sensen doesn‚Äôt think that is Kant‚Äôs goal.</p><p>Should we revere others (and not just the moral law)? No.</p><p>Respect</p><p>Recognition</p><p>Appraisal</p><p>Maxim</p><p>Kant seems to be locked in an ivory tower. There seems to be me and the moral law, but not a lot of room for me and others.</p><p>Why doesn‚Äôt the pain of another give me a ‚Äúreason‚Äù to help them? A maxim of universal help‚Ä¶what generates this duty? Sensen blames this on our judeo-christian tradition.</p><p>4:401 note, my spirit bows toward the moral law inside someone else (possibly).</p><p>Equivalent</p><p>In Result, but not logically</p><p>Content, logically</p><p>Perhaps both senses</p><p>1st formulation</p><p>Don‚Äôt make an exception (4:429)</p><p>2nd</p><p>Don‚Äôt exalt yourself (6:449) ‚Äì thinking of yourself as being better, as not needed the law to apply to you</p><p>What is our ordinary conception of autonomy?</p><p>What is Kant‚Äôs conception?</p><p>How does it differ?</p><p>Sovereignty (political notion)</p><p>Authenticity (who is the real me)</p><p>Capacity to choose whatever I want‚Ä¶up to me, moral responsibility making</p><p>Self governance vs. self legislation</p><p>‚ÄúAct on your own will‚Äù</p><p>Will ‚Äì it comes with the moral law packed into it. Actingon your own will means actingon the moral law.</p><p>Capacity we have to govern ourself, independently of desires, society, nature</p><p>Goal ‚Äì something we should aspire to,</p><p>Right ‚Äì</p><p>6:417-8 ‚Äì can you have duties towards yourself? No. new years resolution, you can unbind such a thing.</p><p>What is legislation?</p><p>Content</p><p>Binding</p><p>6:227 ‚Äì we are the author of the obligation/bindingness, but not the content.</p><p>What is self?</p><p>The self is pure practical reason. Not an empirical reason, not like introspection (should I do A or B?). If it isn‚Äôt empirical, then maybe it is noumenal (6:418-9), homunculus it is not, however. Categorical self, law giving of its own kind, not dependent on desire, society, or nature, which is unconditional.</p><p>5:33, 43</p><p>‚ÄúAct on your own will‚Äù</p><p>Self Governance (the responsibility sense)</p><p>Desires</p><p>Society</p><p>Nature</p><p>Capacity/goal/right</p><p>Self-legislation (Freedom, the grounds of a the moral law)</p><p>What is legislation?</p><p>Content</p><p>Binding</p><p>What is self</p><p>Empirical</p><p>Noumenal (spooky homunculus)</p><p>Own law giving (doesn‚Äôt refer to any form of self) ‚Äì just refers to law giving self-reflexively, in such a way that it isn‚Äôt dependent upon anything else</p><p>Capacity</p><p>Duty (instead of goal and right)</p><p>Condition of the possibility of morality</p><p>‚ÄúValue mission‚Äù ‚Äì goal has ‚Äúvalue‚Äù built into it, which is denied on Sensen‚Äôs interpretation.</p><p>Affect or ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù is the natural place for Kant to look for an account of the direct ‚Äúmental attunement‚Äù to value found in the ‚Äúmoral feeling.‚Äù (CJ 5:267-268)</p><p>Your own reason commands you, independently of what you want. What would be a justification for Kant‚Äôs claim? Why should we believe there is a CI?</p><p>What question is he asking in the 3rd section of the groundwork? He wanted to start with our ordinary opinions, and find and formulate the supreme principle of morality. He started with motivation, then he went for the metaphysics of morals, giving it a philosophical treatment, and he came up with these different formulations. The 3rd section justifies the CI.</p><p>If duty, then CI</p><p>We haven‚Äôt shown there is duty, 4:389 explicated common conception of morality.</p><p>At 4:425-</p><p>That there is a CI (assertorically) ‚Äì 4:446</p><p>I have a CI, but I also have other interests. In case of conflict, why should I give preference ot the CI?</p><p>The observance is duty. The CI is overriding ‚Äì 4:449</p><p>Does he establish and justify that there is a CI, and does he show that it is overriding?</p><p>How does he argue there really is a CI?</p><p>We have to conceive of ourselves as free. This concept of freedom, is the idea of not being influenced by alien forces.</p><p>We assume we have freedom. A free will is a will under the CI. Hence, we there is the CI.</p><p>If freedom, then morality.</p><p>Freedom is autonomy, and autonomy is freedom.</p><p>We start from the theoretical, we aren‚Äôt just leaves in the wind and pushed by desires, but somehow we can determine ourselves.</p><p>Theoretical-&gt; Moral command</p><p>Freedom-&gt;Morality</p><p>Freedom</p><p>Morality</p><p>5:29, Freedom and morality imply each other</p><p>Why should freedom imply morality?</p><p>Freedom is a form of causality. Following Hume, Kant thinks that causality follows from laws. Random isn‚Äôt freedom, Law is required. Freedom is a form of law, it is a special law, not a law of nature.</p><p>Freedom can‚Äôt be a law that has a matter, it can‚Äôt be empirical, it can‚Äôt be a law of nature.</p><p>4:402, 421, 446 ‚Äì it can‚Äôt be heteronomy, it rules out content, and leaves only the form ‚Ä¶.for freedom.</p><p>Negative freedom might imply you aren‚Äôt determined at all, might be absurdly random, and that‚Äôs why you need a law.</p><p>Helping others and not helping is the result of the CI.
