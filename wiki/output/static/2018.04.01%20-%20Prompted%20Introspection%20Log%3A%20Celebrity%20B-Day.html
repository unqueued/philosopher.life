<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What TV or movie star would you like to invite to your birthday party?</h2><p>I don't have birthday parties. We clean the house; we eat (pizza or steak) and chocolate cake on my birthday. I get laid. That's a good day, I tell ya' what.</p><p>Note how &quot;invite&quot; is not the same thing as them accepting or actually coming. I'll assume you mean the latter. Otherwise, I could just &quot;invite&quot; every human who ever lived (GL, you dead mother fuckers).</p><p>I can't say I'm a fan of celebrities, particularly actors. I don't respect them, and even those actors who give the appearance of someone I respect are simply generating PR optics and simulacra. I genuinely don't think they are good people. </p><p>You know what. I would consider choosing Cumberbuns for my Cumberbitch wife. Or Loki, or Growley (or whatever his name is) from Supernatural (the retarded angel)...I think my wife would also prefer an author. Regardless, a celebrity would be wasted on me, I think.</p><p>Carice van Houten, who plays Lady Melisandre, and I'd want her in character and dressed as the Red Woman for my party too. That would be stupid hot. It also misses the point of the question, in my eyes.</p><p>I want to meet authors, leaders, and teachers, not actors. This would be easier if I could choose anyone who has been on the big screen but wasn't a star.</p><p>Do I get to actually pick the person's brain? I have long known Kevin Spacey was a psychopath, and I'd be very interested to understand him. That said, I don't trust him. So, that's a no go.</p><p>I would probably be most interested in a comedian. I have watched a fuckton of comedy, to the point that I've forgotten far more than I can remember. Unfortunately, who they are on the stage is still just a simulacrum of who they really are. I really do wish I could speak with George Carlin! Jon Stewart would be less interesting (I consider him an obvious neo-lib though). Much of the Daily Show cast would be interesting still. Yet, I am afraid they are all optics as well. It's hyperreality to me.</p><p>I think following celebrities isn't just dumb, but immoral (not merely because it is dumb either). If you forced my hand, I guess Keanu Reeves wouldn't be awful. I've heard he might be a decent human being, and he is a star of my absolute favorite movie.</p><p>Do politicians count as TV/Movie Stars? This becomes much more interesting if so. In a way, they are. They are screen whores, no doubt. Warren (I'd rim her out, eat her ass, etc.),<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.03</sup></button> Obama, the Clintons, the Bushes, Paul Ryan, Jinping, Putin, Merkel, et al. No, I got this, yo (and, he is a bona fide T.V. star):</p><p>Donald J. Trump</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2018.12.03 : </span> Unfortunately, I have been charmed by the Neoliberal yet again. She talks just enough of the talk, but I can see she isn't what I had hoped.</sub></p></div>
