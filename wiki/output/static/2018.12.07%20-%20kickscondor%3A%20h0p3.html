And, of course, h0p3 has been doing this for a very long time and I am only copycatting. His are ‚Äòlight-hearted plain-web d0xxings‚Äô or somesuch‚Äîemail, address, phone number, links to conversations. Mine are just that person‚Äôs words and my thoughts in summation‚Äîwhich is far more of a calling card to me, particularly after these other identifiers have expired.</p><p>As with most things, though, I am still playing catching with him. He says in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Find%2520the%2520Others.html">Find the Others</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I believe that by honestly uploading my mind into my wiki, we both have access to an enriched network of references for generating accurate theories of each other‚Äôs minds.</p></blockquote><p>Ahh, dear me, so then it takes much more than a page‚Äîthis entire endeavor is sunk. There can be no eulogy or summation. It would take a massively overloaded TiddlyWiki to accurately describe such an one as this‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p>To some non-trivial extent, the labels, attributes, characteristics, properties, and models I generate about a person help form a kind of name.</p></blockquote><p>In reply to this, our friend Sphygmus[1] writes:</p><blockquote><p>I want to talk about the vocabulary of ‚Äúmodeling‚Äù another person as well. I think I have observed that people don‚Äôt understand what you mean when you say you clearnet doxx them in order to better model them. For me, though, that was one of the most intuitive things you say. When I was in college the first time, I worked as an ILL student worker and loved it, largely because it sent me wandering through the stacks to pull out such a varied selection of books. One of the books I pulled that really stuck with me discussed how we form mental models of people in our heads and rehearse conversations with those people at various times, and the ways in which those rehearsals could be helpful or not. If I remember correctly, there were even worksheet-like questions for shaping mentally rehearsed conversations in a more helpful way. Sadly, I can remember exactly where I pulled the book from in the library but I‚Äôve been unable to figure out the title ‚Äì I wish I could go back and read it again!</p><p>Of course it also has to do with the problem of other minds and the unbridgeable gap between me and the outside world. Inevitably we only know others through our construction of them within our own minds.</p></blockquote><p>After a discussion of the merits of psychometric tests between the two, h0p3 says:</p><blockquote><p>I am inevitably forced to use labels, adjectives, etc. to model (boxing things in is what makes it computable information at all for us).</p></blockquote><p>Ah, well‚Äîso this page is my box. And these are the things I put it in it.</p><p>(<em>If you meet someone‚Äîsomeone with ASCII glasses on, say‚Äîand they purport to be a ‚Äòmadman in the desert‚Äô‚Äîthen put this page straight away. FOR YOU NOW have the genuine artifact in front of you!</em>)</p><p>(<em>However, if you are uncertain, you can do one more thing: you can tell the man a joke. Like: a homunculus and a dark triadic memetic walk into a bar. He will stop you. ‚ÄòLet me stop you right there. Before you finish, please know that I am quite literally autistic and your elegant form of advanced humor which you are so carefully deploying might end up lost in my limbic system somewhere. Forgive me, please, and tell your joke, and thank you for saying it is a joke‚Äîk0sh3k will laugh at me later for this, but I will test out three interpretations of the joke with you now and then have her review the transcripts later‚Ä¶‚Äô</em>)</p><p>(<em>These overwhelming feelings of endearment and admiration and sheer pity that are now coming over you will now materialize in the form of laughter. The joke that was designed to pique the curiosity has now been outpiqued by a new curiosity: one in ASCII glasses that has gone to such great extent to analyze the joke that has been placed on the table‚Äîand, now look‚Äîthis analysis has expanded everything in sight. You look at the joke and see that it is much bigger. And the conversation is now expanded, it is bigger. And the table‚Äîthe table is much bigger, too!</em>)</p><p>(<em>Ok, now, tell me: did you laugh? Did you feel some endearment and admiration and some pity? I don‚Äôt know if you will enjoy or love h0p3 as much as I do, or as much as I purport to‚Äîif not, well, then I understand that, too. There was a time when I thought that I would only frustrate him or that he might just annoy me‚ÄîI was reluctant to say anything or to take the time to read so very many words‚Ä¶</em>)</p><p>(<em>But what is life but a chance to expand a joke, to make the conversation a little longer, or to fancy that maybe even the table at which we sit has now grown?</em>)</p><blockquote><p>I aim to do you justice.</p></blockquote><p>It‚Äôs that chivalrous, sensible, steelnivorous h0p3‚Äîhe steels you up, then it‚Äôs all night steel for breakfast!</p><p>This short sentence is a trope of h0p3. He ‚Äòaims‚Äô‚Äîhe has a very specific set of purposes in mind for you, good good, his work is a pointed effort. A discovery of truth? A deep sea recovery of some rarified moral sense? I cannot characterize it properly. But to ‚Äòaim‚Äô is truly a bold facet.</p><p>(<em>More to come‚Ä¶ I am drafting here, gently drafting and it‚Äôs dinnertime once again‚Ä¶</em>)</p><p>[1] A friend.
