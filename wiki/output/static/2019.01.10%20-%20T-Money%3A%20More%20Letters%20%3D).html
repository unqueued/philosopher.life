<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Dear T-Money,</p><p>Thank you for writing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.12.16%2520-%2520T-Money%253A%2520A%2520Formal%2520Letter!.html">a letter</a> to me. I'm going to walk and talk through it with you in the desert, nomad. Let me know if I can {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="help.html">help</a>} you with anything on this wiki.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I find writing a letter odd. In many way. I have isolated myself to text messages, facebook messages, and phone calls. I suppose the immediate response from others is inline with the instantly desired gratification I am accustomed to.
</p></blockquote><p>Agreed. I think forming long-sequences of thoughts with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a>, putting time into communicating with each other in both breadth and depth, and taking the risk of possibly wasting our time in investing our precious resources toward empathizing with each other is becoming rarer and rarer. The instant gratification drugs are simply too delicious. I am grateful that you take the time to part with what is now convention here to write a letter. It means a lot to me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am also writing this using wordpad, and not MS WORD. I am very ms word reliant for spell check, auto correct of spelling and the synonyms feature. Researching a hack to get it for free. I have MS office suite on my desktop, but I am sitting in the living room on my new laptop. It does not have ms WORD....
</p></blockquote><p>I got you covered on pirating Office. Hopefully, that will be of use to you. Don't worry about your grammar. Mine is really bad too. It has been a sore spot for me having grown up dirt fucking poor with donors who didn't give a shit enough to teach their children any better.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">g</sup></button> I am, of course, annoyed by people who pick at grammar or tone-police rather than address the semantics of the argument. Fear not, sir, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="IA2DYJ.html">IA2DYJ</a>! It is my privilege to receive a letter from you, and I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> to honor your gift to me. You may think it macaroni art or lacking the beauty you want, but I know you have handed me treasure: you have taken the time to think with me.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Nonetheless, the letter begins, and will likely end, with a helter skelter rambelings of a half intoxicated bitter, sad, and depressed young man.
</p></blockquote><p>Preach, homie. Ramble away. I know I do. Some stories can only be told in fragmented form. I can only bear to look at some stories while I'm intoxicated. I am sorry to hear you are depressed. I know the feeling. I wish I had an answer.</p><p>This might seem dumb to you, but I had <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.09.10%2520-%2520Retired%253A%2520%252Fb%252F%2520-%2520Random%2520-%2520%2520The%2520Playground%2520of%2520the%2520Sandbox%2520-%2520Seed.html">dedicated to you</a> the seed of one of my most <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Leet.html">Leet</a> and decorated projects on this wiki: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">r</sup></button> Indeed, I am indebted to you and to myself for taking the risk of rambling to myself there. I appreciate the courage and inspiration you have given me. It is not often that I have the chance to thank a person through my wiki for how they have shaped me and my wiki. </p><p>Thank you!</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>My only true &quot;best friend&quot; who I attempt to text with every day.
</p></blockquote><p>I have asked you before what you think counts as friendship. I hope it will be a concept you continue to think about. I don't have a great answer on this front. I aim to find or construct a decent one in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">Find The Others</a>, one of my {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Axioms.html">Axioms</a>}.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Told me recently that I aquired all that a man could desire too early in life. In doing so it has caused me to be depressed. More significantly that I might have otherwise.
</p></blockquote><p>Do you think that is true? Do you really think you've acquired what matters most to your life? I would offer the counterclaim that you acquired many things and have found they aren't sufficient for eudaimonia. It is possible you are experiencing existential depression not because you have what is sufficient too early but because you realize that what many thought was sufficient actually isn't.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>We spoke about this in a previous text and you mentioned the hedonic treadmill. I was unaware of the term but I looked it up quickly to educate myself. More or less, just read the definition. No in depth research.
</p></blockquote><p>I hope you will spend more time thinking about it. I still am. I think it's easy to pursue hedonia to the exclusion of the other aspects of eudaimonia. I cannot claim to have succeeded, but I also don't think it's entirely up to me either. I believe satisfaction at this level requires a sufficient number of people work together using the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> principle.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">p</sup></button></p><p>I also hope you'll think very carefully about that game-theoretic notion of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>. It will be important to aspects of our disagreement, and this is now a classic economics concept (in fact, we learned about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T4T.html">T4T</a> in our microecon course together).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am overwhelmed with work at work, work at home, being a father, being a husband. Attempting to maintain a few friends and find time to do the things I enjoy.
</p></blockquote><p>You told me 2018 was not a good year for your family either. I feel like we are barely eking it out. The pressure is enormous. Much of this is not up to us. =( I am sorry.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I did enjoy writing, years ago, and in many ways I suppose I still do. But I have nothing of interest to say. I enjoy bragging on my ablity to crank out a 5 or 10 research paper in hours. But I dont do research worthy of writing about anymore. I also dont have the depression that is associated with heartache and heavy drug use. This is what makes the best stuff... i think. im unsure.
I'm smart enough to know I don't know much about anything. I am smart enough to know my opinions are indeed opinions. I do not feel increadibly strongly about much these days. I find myself fluid. I am a puddle of a man, easily pushed around, and just flowing through this life without trying to make much waves.
</p></blockquote><p>Do you have nothing of interest to say to yourself? Why not make waves in and for yourself? Depression's a bitch. =(</p><p>Your puddle metaphor is fascinating. It's poetic. Sometimes I think of fluidity as being a wonderful property. In this case, you have beautifully shown its ugly side. Maybe you should think and write more about it. I'd be interested to hear that fleshed out.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I listen to alot more country music these days. I alternate my pandora between tyler childers radio, chris knight radio, and rehab radio. So new folk style country and rap, often white rappers.
</p></blockquote><p>I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2019.01.11%2520-%2520Music%2520Exploration%253A%2520T-Money.html">took a listen</a> to several songs from these folks. You'll have to let me know some rap music to listen to as well. I appreciate having the opportunity to explore your <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="music.html">music</a>. It's a different window into your world.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am intrigued by your WIKI page. I am also confused by 90% of it. It appears to be a blog, a catelogue of conversations, to do lists, and ranting.
</p></blockquote><p>That's about right. It's not easy to pin-down (I'm trying to). I've been wrastlin' this sumbitch for a while now, and I can't say I know what it is either (nor what it will or should become).</p><p>I can believe that is the case for 90% of what you've seen. Just to be clear, there's no way you've seen 90% of the whole (I'm not sure what would be the fastest way to get the gist of this ever-changing object). It's so much larger than it looks at first (and second) glance. Just by line or word count, I believe it is larger than the sum of all the Kurt Vonnegut books I sent you combined.</p><p><em>Rant</em> can be a dismissively inflammatory word. There are rants in here, of course. There are many serious (and even academic) arguments in here. I suggest not all rants are irrational or immoral. There is plenty worth considering.</p><p>I think {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>} and {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>} best define what the wiki is for me, and for you, I think {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Help.html">Help</a>} is the best introduction I can give at the moment. It is fairly difficult to describe all of what I'm doing here in a succinct manner. I don't have a lot of things I can nicely compare it to either. Imho, nobody has actually built anything like what I have here at this scale.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> It may be a fair to say just talk too goddamn much to myself.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Again, I will attempt to review it more often. I scanned it to see our signal convos copied and pasted there. I am unsure why, but i suppose i appricate that you appriciate them enough to include them on your page.
</p></blockquote><p>It's been a long while since I mentioned it over the phone. You might check out {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Contact.html">Contact</a>} on the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Root.html">Root</a> page as well as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="FTO.html">FTO</a>. Many people have found this to be a difficult part of the rabbithole to swallow.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">w</sup></button></p><p>Your conversations with me matter to me a great deal. I have tried to explain how much, but it will take some time to see. I believe our conversations are an extension of my identity. Honesty and transparency are profound moral concerns in my practice in this wiki.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I suppose I feel like your intellect could be better utilized on a book? But I also suspect that you are working on writing a book as well? I do not know, and like you say, its probably on your wiki page.
</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate the praise of thinking I should write a book. You are not the only person to suggest it. My brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> and perhaps even my friend <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Josiah.html">Josiah</a> have made that case (at least initially). The wiki is the primary text I aim to send into the world. I would argue that the wiki is kind of hypertext that I simply couldn't replicate in a standard codex. The more you understand the wiki, the more you'll understand why I'm writing it instead of a standard book (at least for now).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">l</sup></button></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I am surpised that I gave you the address to my deadjournal. It is not something that I share with many. Usually it is when i want to impress a girl im &quot;cheat texting&quot; with and I want to impress her with some cute or introspective poetry.
</p></blockquote><p>Maybe you are trying to impress me? I can offer you no handjobs for wisdom or poetry. Btw, our history teacher is dead. =(</p><p><code>/salute</code></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I have a few more songs on my desktop that are not on my deadjournal. I have it all saved on my computer and backed up in case they ever delete it for inactivity. I had a opendiary.com in college too. but it got deleted for inactivity and the website closed. I was able to go in and save everything though. I had a livejournal. it was gay i stopped.
</p></blockquote><p>I am a huge fan of owning your data. You mention some good reasons. If you ever want to setup a wiki to store your work, let me know. I'll be happy to help you set it up.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I do utilize my Facebook more. I have a &quot;secrete group&quot; that only my close family and friends i add get to see. you cant search the group and anything anyone else posts, shares or comments cannot be view except by only those in the group. most of the pictures and things I send to you are repeats of what I have posted there.
</p></blockquote><p>I have gathered that, lol. =) I assume I do not give you responses similar to your FB group. I do not know. How often do you have serious conversations with others?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Unfortunatly society is no longer interested in anything that is long than a few sentences. 140 charecters. A photo with a caption. and I have fallen prey to the desire for a responce from my readers.
</p></blockquote><p>I can appreciate that a great deal. I argue similar points often enough. It's hard to find people who will take you seriously and respond in depth. Not giving a shit, including shallowness, is easier, less of a risk, and it's not as painful. I think most people actively avoid introspection and empathizing beyond the surface, especially when it is sacrificial. I'm doing my best to move the other direction too (but, ofc, I'm an internet drug addict who adores the low-hanging hedonic digital fruit).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>That is how I started my oringal open diary, journals, and the like. I have always wanted an audience. I felt I was worthy of an audience. But as i grow up. I realize the unfortunate reality that i am just a fat old man who never completed anything. I have started alot of things. came close to finishing many things. but in reality. Year, my life and all things are just unfinished projects. lol. I take some of that back, there are many things i have completed, but i often grow bored of long term projects and will abandon them for something new. It is a sad disease of depression and anxiety and likely some bipolar tendencies.
</p></blockquote><p>I often think of consciousness as us telling ourselves the stories of ourselves (I'm not sure how indepth you may want to go here). Another way I like to think about the ethics of our consciousness is in terms of projects (ends and means relationships). The OG <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Relic.html">Relic</a> of this wiki was formerly {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Projects.html">Projects</a>} (itself a direct descendant of the page I have dedicated to you). That actually branched and exploded into {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Focus.html">Focus</a>} and much of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Root.html">Root</a>. I fear you will never know how much I value and have come to understand your phrase &quot;I'm just a box of contradictions.&quot;<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">kc</sup></button> Saint Hegel would shake your hand. I'm grateful you took the time to speak with me in college; those particular words bordered on being prophetic to me.</p><p>I know what it's like to have so many unfinished projects. This wiki is full of them (and before that, legions more). Perfectionism seems to make it feel worse too.</p><p>Knowing what you know now, what do you hope to accomplish in life? What do you predict you will accomplish instead? What are your {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Dreams.html">Dreams</a>} and why?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But honestly, who gives a fuck about my mental state other than my wife and kid and a couple of friends? As long as im not suicidal and I can be a dad, husband, money maker and health insurance provider... I am succesfull...
</p></blockquote><p>I would be interested to know the principles upon which the standards of existential success are founded. I appreciate that you wrestle with both the ideal and practical.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I think for the most part friendships and relationships are superficial despite all efforts. Even my closest friend, who i confide everything in.... is both physically distant and often mentally and emotionally distant. we are all tied to our little family units and are expected to fullfill those obligations before anything, often before we take care of ourselfs. 
</p></blockquote><p>I agree for the most part they are that way. I'm not sure if it has to be that way, nor do I think that is really in virtue of us all putting forth our best effort. Our relationship does not have to be superficial. I make myself as open and available as I can.</p><p>It must suck to have your best friend feel so distant. I have recently experienced a slipping away with one of my oldest friends. I grew up since I was 13 with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ALM.html">ALM</a>. Two decades later, it appears the friendship has been dissolved. It sucks. </p><p>As I age, and as I see that it takes more and more effort for someone to get to know me, the more motivated I've become to build bridges for newcomers to my life to choose to become real friends. I covet the handful of profound relationships I have. I hope to nurture them and plant more. If it's this difficult at 33, I cannot imagine what it is like at 53. I've always been a fairly lonely person; it's hard work to fight back. It's exhausting.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I suppose that expectation has saved my life many times when I wanted to end it or walk away from it all. I know that emotion is tempoary and &quot;this too shall pass&quot;. I do my best to preoccupy myself with projects, obligations, responciblities that I can accomplish, and are not deterimental to my mental or physical health.
</p></blockquote><p>I have no room to talk here. I plan to take my life as soon as morally possible. I hope you find a better solution.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The country music artist Chris knight said it best.
&quot;I'm thankful for the things I have
And all the things I don't
And I've got dreams that will come true
I've got some that won't
Most the time I just walk the line wherever it goes
'Cuz you can't hang yourself if you ain't got enough rope&quot;
I met him here in somerset at a concert and stood in line to get his autograph. I akwardly like a teenager told him that the song enough rope saved my life as he placed his autograph on an album I bought. He said thank you and handed my autograph back to me to fullfilled the request of those behind me in line... I was embarassed, but the words were true no matter how anxiety ridden my voice was. I will include a link to the version of the song I love the most. And, i suppose i love it because i was almost the guy that never left that little 3 red light town i went to HS in. And i have alot of women back there who i could easily &quot;get&quot; and have discussed getting with them... i suppose i will discuss that issue here momentarlly</p><p>the song
</p></blockquote><p>You had lights in your town? City boy.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">c</sup></button> =)</p><p>I'm trying to think of what that would be like for me. I guess meeting T-Money <em>Reznor</em> would be like that for me. It sounds like it was an important experience to you (understandably). Even if only for yourself, I wonder what you'd say to him in a longer letter. It is not often that we have (or take) the chance to thank people like that.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I met my wife on an internet dating site. I got alot of hook ups and girls off internet dating sites since we first got dial up back in the 90s. I am an orgial facebook memeber, back when they required you to have a .edu email to sign up! like 14 years now i guess. I also did the myspace things. I have never managed to create a following of my own, and I suppose with that my writing fell by the waste side. Especially when i got later in college, and i was dating my wife. She does not really like poetry and does not appriciate my writing in any way.
</p></blockquote><p>Aye. You definitely had more of an online presence than most of the guys I knew at Berea.</p><p>I signed up to look around on these sites, but I didn't participate. These social practices just didn't (and by-and-large still don't) work for me; they broke several of my principles. It has been a miracle that I've been willing to go public with my wiki at all. I am glad to have the chance to be myself in public though.</p><p>I am surprised your wife doesn't care for you writing. Why? That seems weird to me. What does your wife like most about you? </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>She is an intelligent woman but not formally educated. she went to murry state for a year or so then had to drop out due to mono infection. Then she ended up going to cosmotology school. It took awhile but now she and her best friend own a 3 person salon together. Very cheap lease payment, it was an existing salon, so most of what was required for move in was just paint and whatnot. I did alot early on to get them up and running. My wife did all the painting and has redone all kinds of stuff. I have taught her well how to use a screw gun, drill holes in dry wall install achors and level off shelves.
</p></blockquote><p>Does she enjoy her work? What does your daughter think of it? How far away is the salon from your house? I know your job has a long fucking commute. Does the salon make money? On a scale of 1-10, how envious are you of (what I assume is) your wife's self-employment?<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">j</sup></button> Sounds like you might eventually go that direction too (not the salon, but perhaps teaching as you've said elsewhere).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Our marriage is often one of conviencnce and necessity. I love her, immensely, but often feel like a partner living with a roomie i share a bed with.
</p></blockquote><p>That is a fascinating claim. That could just be how you are comfortable with each other. From afar, with as little knowledge as I have here, it sounds sad, unfulfilling. </p><p>What is the concept of marriage or a life-partner to you?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>We are comming up on our 10 year anniversay.
</p></blockquote><p>Congratz. That is a third of your life. That's awesome.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It is amazing we have made it this far. The forgiveness she has is unrivaled. I cannot begin to explain, but we are in good working order as a family, our little unit is awesome for my daughter. I did not have that as a child, and I am so proud of us both for making it to this point. We were married in april and samantha was born the following febuary. My wife got pregnant the first month we were married! lol.
</p></blockquote><p>I'm glad to hear it. I'm lucky to have a wife who has allowed me wrestle my demons, supported me through thick and thin. There are places in my life only she is allowed to touch.</p><p>Also, I don't know if you remember, but <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">k0sh3k</a> got pregant with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h.html">j3d1h</a> in our first month too! Lol. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I feel God knew i needed that. Having samantha in my life has been the deciding factor in my quasi sobriety. She is amazing. last night Kathy was not feeling well and went to bed early. So we snuck out after dinner so i could get some beer and she could get a Mcflurry. Ofcourse when we left i told my wife we were going to the store. And this morning I admited to her that we snuck off to get beer and a mcflurry for her. I try to be as honest as possible to my wife. But in samanthas eyes, we agreed we wouldnt tell &quot;mom&quot;. My wife asked her this morning about a mcflurry in the trash can and without hesitation my daughter reminded her that I got one last week and that was it.</p><p>I know that teaching a child to lie to your spouse is odd parenting. BUt wow, what a proud dad moment to have a child finally have my back like that. Even though my wife already knew, I gave her hand to throat swipe - telling her to stop giving samantha a hard time. lol. 
</p></blockquote><p>I can appreciate enjoying having your child have your back like that. That must have been a difficult moment filled with mixed feelings. That is a tough story to hear. I admire how incredibly honest you can be.</p><p>How'd your wife take it?</p><p>If my kids had a favorite, it would be their mom (but, their mom is my favorite too, lol).</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Samantha knows that i have a drinking problem, and we have talked about it. she knows im not suppose to drink and drive, or drink too much. But the scope of it she is not aware of, and not old enough to process. 
</p></blockquote><p>That will be a difficult thing for her to understand. I talk about substances constantly with my children. There are very high use rates on my side of the family, and given their intelligence and predispositions, I'm strongly convinced they will have many experiences with substances. Harm-reduction practices, research, preparation, phenomenology, addiction concepts, self-control, and honest introspection will be valuable tools for them, imho. </p><p>My brother <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">JRE</a> has asked me if I would ever give them substances. I have let them both try bits of various spirits, beers, and wines. I'm attempting to remove the forbidden fruit so radically different from my own upbringing. Hell, you remember the first time I got drunk: you got me drunk! Lol. I would be willing to provide Big5 trait openness-inducing shrooms, DMT, or LSD at 18. Everything else I feel uncomfortable until they are 25 and their frontal lobes have developed. I'm still unsure about the matter.</p><p>Talk about addictions, technology is a difficult problem. I feel like I'm forced to help my children learn how to control these kinds of addictions from the beginning because they will eventually have to jump into that pool. They might as well have me there trying to teach them how to swim (though, I'm so dependent perhaps I'm a terrible teacher). </p><p>You might find <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Be%2520A%2520Good%2520Dad.html">Be A Good Dad</a> an interesting place.

$100 by christmas day
after that it drops to $40 by jan 1st.
if she doesnt have it done by jan first, i start taking away electronic devices untill she gets them memorized.
goal, go thru the flash cards, mixed up, 3 times, without adding or subtracting. straight memorization. 
She is about 60% there, and has no doubt she will have it done by christmas. she is trying to figure out what she is gonna spend her money on.</p><p>of course i am helping, teaching, showing all the different methods of ways to manipulate the numbers to get your answers.</p><p>Not memorizing your multipications is absurd. you cannot succed well in mathmatics without doing that in my opinion.
She is in her &quot;smart&quot; focus class for 3rd graders. recently scored the highest in her class on the MAP standardized test for reading and comprehension.
Damn kid is spoiled. No mater how you look at it. lol. i wouldnt have it any other way.
</p></blockquote><p>Well, I'm late with the letter. How's her multiplication tables going? I can't tell you how many times my children have forgotten them. It has been like pulling teeth to get them to grind it enough times to stay with them. That is a sign that I'm doing something wrong. I strongly appreciate how you offer carrots to your daughter. That is the kind of spoilage I admire a great deal.</p><p>Also, we are agreed on the rote memorization point. Boring as it may be, I think brute-force calculation is something that also has to be practiced to some non-trivial extent as well. It is virtue-theoetically necessary.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I have rambeld long enough so this is where I am going to ask you questions and begin to start some structure to a letter exchange.

</p></blockquote><p>This wiki is my most significant text. This is going to sound ridiculously arrogant, but to my knowledge, there is no handcrafted personal wiki as large as mine. There are some bleeding edge kinds of work going on here, imho. But, of course, I think it would be special. It may not be.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You said you abandoned your efforts to obtain your PHD. Why? and why wont you finish.

</p></blockquote><p>High praise, thank you.</p><p>Adjuncts make less than minimum wage. If I ever need the title, certificate, and respect, I'll go finish it. If I were willing to live out there, they'd pay me just above minimum wage to teach while I finished it. I could also just write it and turn it in. There's no point though. I have no interest in the academic game. I am extremely grateful to have learned from the people that taught me though (it would be like learning to play guitar from Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton in some cases).</p><p>The fact is that my wiki is the kind of philosophical work I want to do.

</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I don't have anything in those departments going on. My beautiful tools in my gangbox largely well-oiled but unused. I have a particular toolbox I use that seems to handle most of everything.
