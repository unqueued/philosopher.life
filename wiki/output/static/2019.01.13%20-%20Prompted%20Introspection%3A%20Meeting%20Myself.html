<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What would you do if you met yourself without knowing it was you?</h2><p>Could you imagine, you poor bastards, if there was another one of me in the world? Hahahaha. God help us.</p><p>I'm assuming my existential Parfitian twin doesn't precisely look like me but has inherited equally valued physical characteristics in redpilled perceptual games played by homo sapiens.</p><p>I'm extremely reserved in person (being moral and intelligent comes with the high price of profound loneliness). I'm not sure if I would even get close to my twin. There are only a handful of cases that would enable me to actually get to know my twin. Spending at least a few minutes of time with myself would reveal it though.</p><p>One of the only chances of connecting would be to watch my twin speaking with others (or have him watch me). Often, I am providing the niceties, drivel, smalltalk, and handing folks what they desire to maintain the conversation train. There are also times where I ask leading and exploratory questions, particularize testable comments, attempt to open doorways, and provide bridge-building material in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> cooperation tests. Indeed, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="FTO.html">FTO</a> can be translated as trying to find myself. </p><p>There are also times where I'm uncontrollably interested in something and start rabbitholing on the spot. I would be able to see myself in my twin in these moments. I'd immediately begin interrogating my twin (and my twin the same with me), and in a few minutes, we would discover the reality of the situation. There are many moves which would instantly reveal our uniqueness to each other.</p><p>Technology is another one. I love it. I'm attracted to it like an addiction. I will always watch what people are doing on their machines (often in sadness, disgust, anger, or anxiety). There are some dead giveaways between me and my twin. Game recognize game.</p><p>I'm often looking off into the distance and living in my head. My twin and I would spot the signs (assuming we weren't both lost in thought). We've been there too much not to be curious when we see it.</p><p>There are some tiny flicks of humor and body-language reactions which I would not be able to hold back from myself. I would notice that about my twin. In fact, there are ranges of emotions that we would mirror and stick out like sore thumbs to each other.</p><p>I aim to be as cordial as possible (knowing that I am so repugnant to others); it buys me the necessary space to survive with those who have no interest in understanding me. I pay very close attention when I'm with strangers (I just don't fucking trust people most of the time). One of my few social talents can be, in some circumstances, an ability to pry people open in search of what matters. I would pry myself open at great speed; there is too much shiny inside me to me. It is so rare to find anyone who agrees with me significantly. </p><p>If I'm stuck in a room with just my twin, I wager the game of discovering myself would be over, on average, in 10.2311123 minutes. Exactly how identical we were would likely dictate the rest of how it played out.</p></div>
