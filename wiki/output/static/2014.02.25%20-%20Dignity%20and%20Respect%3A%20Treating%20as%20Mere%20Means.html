<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I don't have any particular argument regarding the reading this week. I have a few thoughts and worries though.</p><p>Parfit may be too quick to pull action apart from intention and motivation. I hesitate to make that move. Further, Parfit seems to be pulling “mere means” apart from immorality. It seems as if he intends to weaken the concept of “mere means.”</p><p>I worry we might be going off the deep end in trying to flesh out “mere means” here. The point is to treat people as they ought to be treated, as ends in themselves. “Mere means” is shorthand, in my book, for not completely treating/regarding others as the ends they are – it is just another word for failing to follow the moral law. There are innumerable ways to fail to treat/regard another as end; this failure is a matter of degrees, but failure is failure. Sometimes, I get the feeling that people use “mere” in “mere means” to be a severe or perhaps maximal failure, and not just any failure, to follow the moral law. I would disagree though. To treat/regard someone as “mere means” is just a failure of some degree to not treat them as ends.  </p><p>Maybe there is a dialectical reason for trying to understand the moral law by uncovering “mere means.” Otherwise, we have some kind of circularity problem in Kant's moral law in the same way that Virtue ethicists all too often fail to say anything significant in applied ethics beyond the mantra “do and be what the virtuous agent would do and be” (which is highly uninformative). Imagine answering “what ought we do?” with “follow the moral law,” and “how do we follow the moral law in this case?” with “don't treat those people as mere means,” and “what does it mean to not treat those people as mere means?” with “follow the moral law.” We need a decision procedure, and perhaps discussing “mere means” in Parfit's way is a path towards an important method. I don't know.</p><p>Part of the approach here was casuistry (Parfit is gifted at it). Casuistry is odd. On one hand, it satisfyingly points out limits to moral theory by making use of my intuitions, and those are sometimes the only grounds I have. Sometimes I'm stuck thinking that intuition is all I have to support and explicate the moral law. On the other hand, I find it unsatisfying because it only prods a black box, and it doesn't necessarily dive into or generate a theory of moral law itself. Even worse, the problem of disagreement becomes quite strong in this approach. </p><hr><p>“merely as a means,” you were “just” using me and nothing more.</p><p>Scientist example (212) isn't so clear. I think one can choose not to cause pain in animals and still perhaps treat those animals as mere means. Suppose I have a rule “try not to cause pain,” that doesn't mean the animals are valuable or worthy of respect or that I actually care about the animals. I can be a certain kind of person that doesn't cause pain but still treats animals as mere means in this case. NM, he deals with it on 214-215 </p><p>I'm not sure I want to immediately agree to the “doing something to someone as a means of achieving some aim” and “treating this person as a means” distinction. It is not obvious to me that any instances of the first are not instances of the second. We have the “authentic self” problem, which makes identifying the real you important, and we may have Plato's classic “parts and kinds” metaphysics problem embedded here as well. I have no idea what to do with it, other than to say this is not obvious or clear. I proceed with caution (Parfit, as always, is amazing at forcing me into these unknown positions).</p><p>Kamm is right in objecting to the definition the rough definition, but Parfit is right about the required revisions. </p><p>The Second Mere Means Principle looks a lot like Recognition Respect. </p><p>(1) might be too weakly stated, but a stronger version seems definitionally correct. “Our treated of this person is governed by the the moral law” (where governed means in accordance with, but in accordance with also means motivated by) does just fine.</p><p>Underlying attitudes or policies for merely as a means. </p><p>Parfit goes for “regard” as a mere tool and “treat” /act/ as a mere means. </p><p>Parfit may be too quick to pull part the action from the motivation, in the case of the gangster (216).</p><p>Treating people as ends just means treating them as they ought to be treated. The limits of how we ought to treat someone seem to be tested by our intuitions and casuistry. </p><p>Casuistry is damning to all approaches to ethics. The virtue ethicist's lack of decision procedure demonstrates the inapplicable nature of their claims (or rather that they can't commit to much of anything in applied ethics with objective reasons), and the consequentalist and deontologist both have their direct problem cases.</p><p>There seems to be a lot of focus on coercion and deception in “mere means” discussions. I think there are other possibilities. I need not deceive or coerce anyone, and I can still treat/regard them as a mere means, i.e. not an end in themselves. </p><p>“Mere means” is too weak. I think we mean something stronger. The problem is that in so many cases, it seems morally permissible (even obligatory sometimes) to use others as a means. “Mere means” implies you aren't treating them as an end, or more specifically, as they kind of end they ought to be treated as.</p><p>I worry we might be going off the deep end in trying to flesh out “mere means” here.

Even worse, the problem of disagreement makes public moral analysis unsatisfactory.</p><p>Parfit seems to be pulling apart “mere means” from the immorality. If we take his definition of “mere means,” then I am left asking why I should really care about the “mere means” talk at all. There is only the moral law to consider.</p><p>A lot of these examples seem to be demonstrate the ability to partially treat/regard someone as an end. Whether or not this means “mere means” isn't terribly important to me. </p></div>
