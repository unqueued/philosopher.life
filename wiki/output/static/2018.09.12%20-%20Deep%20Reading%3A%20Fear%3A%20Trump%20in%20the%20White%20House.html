No doubt.</p><p>The reason he didn't spend a lot on his election is because he doesn't have anything to spend. We know this.</p><p>Here's how I know I've been bit by the hyperreality bug: the book has the confabulatory truthiness that I believe, but I have no idea what's true. It's a whirlwind. The contradiction of believing the unbelievable. We're years into the debacle, and I still feel drowned in it. It's all old and new at the same time. I feel like I'm going insane!</p><p>&quot;Trump hasn't spent a second getting ready for this moment.&quot; This book is so fucking painful.</p><p>I am woefully ignore of Mattis.</p><p>I definitely feel powerless with this book. Fear is right.</p><p>&quot;Compromat&quot; lol!</p><pre><code>      AW  ,...                                             ,,

</code></pre><p>Am I just being a masochist in reading this book? I feel called to witness it. I think it's my duty as a citizen to make sure I'm holding up my end of the bargain. I also fear I'm just constantly confirming my bias over and over and over again! </p><p>This book gets a rise out of me; it's visceral. To what extent is this device not justified in doing so? At what point is this rhetoric?</p><p>I appreciate that the FBI doesn't &quot;confirm&quot; stories, or at least, I appreciate the justification given here. I really don't trust or like them at all either.</p><p>&quot;He didn't look the part&quot; due to his mustache. See, I believe that! The issue of emotional chemistry does seem to be the story here.</p><p>I hate to admit it, but just from a &quot;virtue of the practice&quot; standpoint, Trump's trolling can be impressive.</p><p>The wiretap on Trump tower tweets...I'm just shaking my head. I have no analysis! This is not what I'm supposed to be doing! I'm not actually learning, I'm just feeling.</p><p>McCain is still a piece of shit. Glad I partied to your death, asshole.</p><p>Really does believe/want China to love him. I wish we saw more of the psychology here. This feels like one layer deeper than what we were already gleaning from the news.</p><p>Trumps tweet are too painful to accept. The contradictions are mind-boggling.</p><p>I don't know what isn't a service. I'm supposed to know, but I have philosophical worries about the economic definitions. I have this beef with Marx's taxonomy as well.</p><p>&quot;Why do you have these views?....I just do...I've these views for 30 years&quot; KYS! I fucking hate you so much.</p><p>Trump's protectionism is exactly what it sounds like. I hate to fucking duck rule this.</p><p>&quot;The first daughter&quot; - Jesus!</p><p>Trump's thinking about chemical weapons and children is hard to interpret.</p><p>One interesting thing about Trump's presidency is that his ignorance has very often revealed to me my own ignorance. In a weird way, I'm grateful to him for that.</p><p>Glad that Trump was so angry on May 18th. He's scared. I hope Pence gets fucked too.</p><p>Megaphone to the world it is.</p><p>I do not understand when Trump decides to listen to people.</p><p>Why does he think &quot;Trade is bad&quot;? Is it just plain stupidity? He's painted that way here.</p><p>Tillerson isn't a good guy. Wish they showed that here more effectively. Trump talks trash about Sessions, but I wish Sessions also got his ass kicked here.</p><p>Also: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/trump-new-york-times-woodward/569635/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/trump-new-york-times-woodward/569635/</a></p><p>Aside, I am glad to see Sanders still has a megaphone. </p><p>Of course, I can't point to many politicians legitimately apologizing either. They are all evil in this respect.</p></div>
