TUE 10:06 AM
Aye. I didn't say too much about it in my log; they filled the position.
TUE 10:07 AM
Poo
TUE 10:07 AM
I was hoping for a quality math guru to bounce ideas off of ...but I feel like can do that with you anyway :blush:
TUE 10:08 AM
Lol!
TUE 10:08 AM
I will do my best.
TUE 10:08 AM
Now to be awake enough to have ideas :confused::joy:
TUE 10:09 AM
But! I have found a book of math games that use dnd dice which looks promising
TUE 10:10 AM
Image attached to message
TUE 10:11 AM
Ah. Awesome. Discrete math becomes easier to reason about with practice. Probability is something we are very poorly tuned for in some respects (Monte Hall, for example, is non-intuitive to some mathematicians even), despite the fact that we are constantly engaged in probabilistic inferences (empiricism) and pattern-recognition.
TUE 10:12 AM
Games have taught me a non-trivial portion of the mathematics that I use and enjoy.
TUE 10:12 AM
or they have been a gateway to it
TUE 10:13 AM
That book looks like it's about that.
TUE 10:13 AM
Yes kids that struggle because they dislike ‚Äúmath‚Äù will learn easier from games that teach the same concepts
TUE 10:15 AM
Destroying mathphobia one chillun at a time. Injecting the memes of wholesome math to the rescue.
TUE 10:16 AM
Adults don‚Äôt help when they say ‚ÄúI have never used algebra in my adult life‚Äù
TUE 10:16 AM
/facepalm
TUE 10:16 AM
I have a diatribe I want to launch into for that one.
TUE 10:17 AM
(but, fear not, I will spare you my wall-of-text)
TUE 10:17 AM
Sigh no problem solving ever? Must be a nice life....usually just a stupid adult... but you can‚Äôt really say that directly
TUE 10:17 AM
I was not afraid‚ÄîIt‚Äôs nice to talk with someone who understands ü•∞
TUE 10:18 AM
At least my children don‚Äôt feel that way
TUE 10:19 AM
No doubt. May it serve them well. I can only hope to accomplish the same.
TUE 10:20 AM
Also, since I had been talked about it with you before, you might find this interesting: http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/11/diametrical-model-of-autism-and-schizophrenia/
TUE 10:21 AM
/insert the ‚Äúget all you can from school, you never know what opportunities you may have‚Äù speech. We shall call it Speech #3
TUE 10:22 AM
Lol.
TUE 10:22 AM
Relating (the many facets) of education to human flourishing is a crucial problem. Anti-intellectualism is often a method of confabulation to egoistic dark-triadicism (often not even effectively selfish either), outgrouping without justification, and denying one's personal responsibility to participate as a citizen of Humanity.
TUE 10:25 AM
The Good Life^^tm^^ is teleologically pointing to something which requires we compute as best we can (be it quantitative or qualitative analysis and experience).
TUE 10:26 AM
The autistic student I have right now is new to our school. On the first day, I had the kids write a get to know me card and one if the questions was ‚Äútell me something I should know about you?‚Äù This student wrote ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt like me‚Äù
TUE 11:34 AM
He is very straightforward about himself and his feelings. He doesn‚Äôt always respond to social things either like ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù But...I truly enjoy having him
TUE 11:36 AM
Ah. It sounds like he has experienced difficulty.
TUE 11:37 AM
How does he respond to &quot;how are you?&quot; when he does? When he doesn't respond, is it pure silence?
TUE 11:38 AM
Yes I think he has
TUE 11:38 AM
When he recognizes that I an talking to him, he generally grunts but if it is a good day, he will answer me.
TUE 11:39 AM
Lol
TUE 11:41 AM
/grunt
TUE 11:41 AM
Some famous British experts on Autism have claimed that it is a hypermale brain of sorts.
TUE 11:42 AM
/grunt; /grunt; /grunt
TUE 11:42 AM
Grunting in my neandrathalic world.
TUE 11:42 AM
If he grunts I generally respond with ‚Äî‚ÄúI have those days too‚Äù
TUE 11:40 AM
He made me laugh the other day ..someone was asking a question that was opinion based ...(don‚Äôt remember exactly) he just bluntly said ‚ÄúI am rude so you don‚Äôt want my opinion!‚Äù
TUE 11:43 AM
I know that feel, bro.
TUE 11:44 AM
I responded with ‚Äúmaybe you are just more realistic...?‚Äù
TUE 11:44 AM
I am also thrown back to your Chemistry class with that 9th(?) grade young manchild who was autistic. Perhaps you have a talent for interacting with autists.
TUE 11:57 AM
It was a 9th grader ‚ÄîTaylor
TUE 12:03 PM
Yes!!
TUE 12:04 PM
You have a good memory.
TUE 12:04 PM
I cannot remember any of my students names. Though, I remember his after you say it.
TUE 12:04 PM
That would be a nice talent to have
TUE 12:04 PM
He might be hard to forget. He was a sensitive person, IIRC.
TUE 12:05 PM
He and I had other times where I would find him out in the hall crying and try to help him
TUE 12:06 PM
Yes but he got better as he got older ‚ÄîI think after 9th he didn‚Äôt carry his dish towel to cry in or need a seat for his backpack
TUE 12:07 PM
I know I saw him working (I think it was bussing at a restaurant) after school as a senior
TUE 12:08 PM
I'd rather bus than wait (even if the pay is worse). You ever miss waiting?
TUE 12:08 PM
I am not good at the social game of saying one thing to one‚Äôs face and another behind their back and calling it politeness ... I appreciate the upfront honesty of a Taylor or a Caleb even if its rude
TUE 12:10 PM
Preach, yo.
TUE 12:10 PM
I think I like teaching better but the bookstore can be like waiting sometimes
TUE 12:11 PM
That is true.
TUE 12:11 PM
Not sure if I like the smell of Cracker Barrel or Books more.
TUE 12:11 PM
Oooo that‚Äôs a hard one
TUE 12:12 PM
Now that there isn‚Äôt cigarettes, that would be a tough choice‚Äîhow bout a library with a fireplace cooking bacon
TUE 12:13 PM
Done. Send me there, please. Comfy chair, lots of computers, food, books.
TUE 12:14 PM
They make candles with that book scent.
TUE 12:14 PM
And fireplace and bacon!
TUE 12:14 PM
Sounds like a room we need in our house
