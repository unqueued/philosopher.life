<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The book Silence by Shusaku Endo reminds me of my faith; it reminds me of my walk with Christ. The story is beautifully written, but I‚Äôm not amazed by how well it was written. I am amazed by the subject of the book. Endo captures the very essence of the Christian life, falling down in the face of pain and suffering, and the glimmer of hope beyond our personal failure.</p><p>Have I ever suffered as much as the Christians in this book? I admit I have never been persecuted like the Japanese Christians and missionaries in this book. I am almost ashamed of my faith, or lack there of, when I read about people (fictional or non-fictional) who have the courage to sustain faith even through suffering.</p><p>The book shows humanity‚Äôs inevitable failure. The father Sebastian Rodrigues endures his faith, almost as if his faith isn‚Äôt even the cause of suffering, but simply has a component of suffering in itself. The father does well to prevent his own apostasy for most of the story. He holds out, but in the end, he fails. I‚Äôm almost at the point where I don‚Äôt blame him. I can see why he made his decision. I can‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôd make the same choice as well. Actually, I‚Äôd probably have caved into submission even sooner.</p><p>The antagonist Inoue was not what I expected. I thought he would have look more savage, I‚Äôd expect him to be less civil with the father. I‚Äôd hope that Inoue was just a barbarian. But, the Lord of Chikugo was crafty and wicked. Inoue wanted to break the Christians, not make martyrs.</p><p>Kichijiro was by the far the most interesting character in the story. Obviously Kichijiro was a Judas, but he was driven back to his faith again and again. I don‚Äôt know whether to be confused or simply remind myself that most Christians, including myself, are like Kichijiro. </p><p>The pain in this book isn‚Äôt just physical suffering. The physical suffering spurs on choices that lead to a greater pain. The greatest pain is the pain of apostasy. It is the suffering of those who turn away from G-d because of physical suffering and persecution. It breaks the person, and causes shame. We dishonor G-d by failing Him.</p><p>Am I supposed to think that the priest‚Äôs actions at the end of the story were a good thing? The priest didn‚Äôt think he was committing a sacrilege against G-d. The open admittance of betrayal seems to make the priest guilty in the end. I cannot see how betrayal really leads to a greater form of happiness or love the Lord. I absolutely believe I would turn away from G-d in the face of the torture and suffering found in this story, but I know that it is the wrong choice. I‚Äôm not saying that I would have made a different choice than the priest, but clearly, publicly betraying G-d, committing apostasy (or leading others to believe this is the case) is simply wrong.
