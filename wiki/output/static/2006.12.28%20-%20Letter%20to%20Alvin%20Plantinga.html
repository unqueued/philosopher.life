<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>So, I sent a letter to a guy called Alvin Plantinga. I‚Äôve read some of his work, and some of it is pretty brilliant (even if he is a Calvinist). The response I got was pretty lame‚Ä¶whatever, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs busy and I‚Äôm not going to write him again.</p><p>But, I asked him a few questions which I thought were interesting at the very least‚Ä¶They are good to think about. Concerns I had (my usual of course):</p><p>1) Assuming by free will we mean the ability to do otherwise, and accept no compatibilist notions of free will, how could a perfectly good, omniscient, and omnipotent God, who would always select the same virtuous choice in a given situation, possibly be free? From what I understand, if He chooses to do the exact same virtuous thing in all possible worlds, then He doesn‚Äôt really have the strict ability to do otherwise does He?</p><p>We want to say that God will always do the right thing, but He has the power not to. I wonder if Leibniz‚Äôs ‚Äúinclined without necessitating‚Äù applies in this respect. It would solve a lot of problems. However, if something is true in all possible worlds, isn‚Äôt that a necessary truth? And, if God‚Äôs ‚Äúchoice‚Äù is a necessary truth, then did he really have the ability to do otherwise? My concern is that we might be ambiguous about what we mean by the word ‚Äúcan‚Äù or ‚Äúpossible.‚Äù</p><p>It seems like we only have two options: a.) In some possible world God chooses the non-virtuous choice (uggh, no), or b.) God doesn‚Äôt have a choice.</p><p>The question seems relevant to me because I don‚Äôt see how moral responsibility can exist without free will. So, if God somehow is not free with respect to his actions and choices, then he has no significant choices that entail moral responsibility. Clearly, a virtuous God, who makes moral choices, would require the ability to actually do otherwise. I am quite interested in seeing how God‚Äôs free will is preserved within the context of him being perfectly virtuous. Any ideas?</p><p>2) How would one explain the Holy Trinity isn‚Äôt explicitly contradictory? What are the arguments, if any, that would show how this is at least logically possible (in a broad sense)?</p><p>3) In school we had a seminar on Justice, and we read a number of books on the subject that were quite fascinating, one in particular caught my eye. Robert Nozick wrote Anarchy, State, and Utopia. In the bookhe is responnding to the Rawlsian theory of justice concerning distributive justice, and in his response he lays the framework (with Locke‚Äôs help) for the basis of property and entitlement. The entitlement theory is really a starting place for the rest of his work, in which he argues further notions concerning justice and the minimalist government. His work is relevant to understanding the beliefs of many modern institutions and of Libertarianism. Whether he is correct or not is another question, but he certainly seems pertinent, even in the discussion of theism. In a Western world that increasingly seeks to separate ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù beliefs from reason and civilization, a separation and secularization that is in some ways perpetuated by writings like Nozicks, the theist must find better tools to show that God exists. Nozick‚Äôs explanation of property, one that is widely shared by many, inadvertently seems to give the theist another foothold to work from. Nozick basically explains that:</p><p>a.) Only persons can own property.
b.) All property is ownable by any person.
c.) Only through legitimate acquisition or trade can one come to own property.</p><p>I don‚Äôt usually agree with Libertarian views, but the base entitlement argument is pretty compelling. It seems like these are very acceptable. Wouldn‚Äôt these be good things to agree with?</p><p>Almost hidden, or maybe concealed in his non-descript ‚Äúvariable M,‚Äù Nozick has one other premise to consider</p><p>d.) Persons own themselves. (someone who doesn‚Äôt own themselves isn‚Äôt a person)</p><p>This premise again, at face value seems quite reasonable. I‚Äôve met very few would deny this, especially as having proprietary rights to yourself would seem foundational to possessing personal liberty and freedom. Most people are so greatly concerned with their personal liberty and freedom that they willingly accept the proposition of self-ownership as a necessary property of personhood. Here is where it gets rough:</p><p>e.) Humans, presumably, are the product of people mixing their labor, and are thus subject to the concept of legitimate acquisition.</p><p>As humans can own themselves, and all property is ownable by all people, then all humans can be owned by other persons. And, as humans are a form of property, if only a property unto themselves, then they are also subject to property acquisition and trade.</p><p>From here we can gather the first major problem:</p><p>f.) No human owns themselves, as parents own their children.
g.) Repeat step f) ad nauseum, and, as nobody created themselves, nobody owns themselves.</p><p>It is here that theism seems to enter the realm of entitlement theory.</p><p>h.) The creator of these humans is the owner. If no person mixed their labor (and there is no creator), then property makes no sense at all. The prime cause, God, is the creator and rightful owner of all in the universe.
i.) As no one but God owns themselves, no human is a person.</p><p>We either accept that property makes no sense at all, which has some pretty negative consequences for the Libertarian and for some fundamental aspects of civilization, or we accept that property rights do exist, and we are forced into the prime owner argument, (and surely we could make arguments for God‚Äôs self-ownership).</p><p>So, how do we arrive at our self-ownership?</p><p>If humans don‚Äôt own themselves, and are legitimately owned by some prime creator, and only persons can own property, then how do people legitimately have the ownership of themselves traded to them?</p><p>The major problem then becomes:</p><p>You can not trade or acquire property as a non-person, which means you cannot come to own yourself. A non-person cannot come to be a person, and only beings with initial self-ownership have the right to own anything (including themselves).</p><p>It would seem to me, that if we follow Nozick‚Äôs understanding of property, which appears quite reasonable, that nobody could actually own themselves. However, most people would probably want to conclude they do own themselves, and so we move on to what I would think is a flat miracle. God somehow bestowed upon us the right to ourselves. Personally, I‚Äôd call Nozick‚Äôs ‚Äúvariable M,‚Äù this person-making characteristic, the Imago Dei. Maybe through the gift of self-ownership and freedom from God we can solve this puzzle.</p><p>Or, did I form a straw man argument altogether? Is it useful? What do you think?</p><p>4) Many theodicy issues really boil down to considering whether evil outweighs good or vice versa. We assign some ‚Äúvalue‚Äù (good or bad, to some degree) to everything that exists. In this judgment the appearance of evil would seem to ‚Äòdevalue‚Äô the net worth of a world in some way. It is as if a possible world with 4,000 units of evil is measurably worse than one with only 20 units of evil, or even no units of evil. This is still a judgment based on evil and good values being weighed in a world.</p><p>Why should this sort of thinking influence the theist? If God is supreme, if He is really the greatest conceivable being, then would He not also be of infinite moral value? And, if He has infinite good value, then would not measurable and finite evil values found in this world be nulled by His infinite value on this judgment scale? How could one actually compare 4,000 units of evil or even 20 units of evil, finite measurements, to an infinite value of God? Finite numbers become meaningless when compared to infinite values.</p><p>So, a world with 4,000 units of evil is not measurably better than a world with 20 units or no units of evil when an infinitely good being exists. When compared, no less value comes about. All that remains is the infinite value of God.</p></div>
