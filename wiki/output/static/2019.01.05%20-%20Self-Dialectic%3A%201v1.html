<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I used to be a skilled 1v1 PvP artist. I wrote the dueling book for Rogues<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">r</sup></button> from late vanilla through mid-TBC (and I was a mean duelist on every class with or without gear).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">b</sup></button> I was a failure in group PvP; I'm not bad, but I'm wildly worse. It scaled out too; I was much stronger 2v2 than 3v3 or 5v5. I'm bad at league: I lane and ARAM like a Diamond player (even the diamond players were impressed by my hedged-conservative 1v2 lanes in 3v3), but I'm fucking Plat in 5v5. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="MTG.html">MTG</a> is a solid example (especially for storytelling) where I had no business playing in casual groups. I did well in D2 laddering and duels. I played solo classes in EQ (grouping was only for fun). I was a competitive capper in Tribes 2 (though I became a much stronger all-rounder in Ascend), making it a very specific game with routes, perfected skiing and air-travel, handling bodyblockers, and outrunning shrike pilots; it was uncommon for me to even attempt to coordinate or deal with larger scale notions. Back when I could, I played 1v1 dexterity-laden strategy games and subgames into <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="infinigress.html">infinigress</a> with some skill.</p><p>I don't play amazingly alongside others (though I try my best). The only chance I have of being useful is breaking the rules, going rogue, finding the cracks, special one-man teams, camping, etc. If I don't get to see and control the entire structure, I'm pretty screwed. I can't predict my own teammates well enough.</p><p>My wife commented on this at the party tonight. In some one-on-one discussions: I'm vivid, intense, and a handful, but in a group my models are completely useless (often depth isn't even possible). I lose huge chunks of my predictive powers. I am autistic. I scale poorly. I sometimes have a strong ability to put myself into a single person's shoes in adversarial settings, but I can't say I'm effective otherwise.</p><p>I think I'm getting worse across the board here, but there is still something correct about this rule of thumb. My <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="self-dialectic.html">self-dialectic</a> may be strongly affected by my 1v1 prowess, especially if I become skilled at predicting myself. That said, my executive functioning can be really awful. I have a modeling problem.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">r : </span> <code>/wave</code>, Roguespot</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">b : </span> A game that proved to me that I should avoid skinnerboxes with bots and only play exactly what mattered to me.</sub></p></div>
