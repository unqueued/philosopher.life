<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My brother said something odd to me the other day: he thinks he is not a good writer. I've seen my brother's writing (for a long time), and I simply have to disagree with him. I don't disagree just because his writing has always been much better than anything I can do, I know he is a good writer because he communicates truth (and does a good job of presenting it to boot). I know he can write very well, but JRE simply disagrees. He wouldn't explain what led him to the conclusion, but my guess (which is probably quite accurate) is that the English professor that teaches JRE's &quot;Christianity&quot; class is overly harsh, critical of the wrong things, and maybe even lacking a full understanding of what &quot;a good writer&quot; exactly means. JRE will see his paper marked up or given a poor grade, maybe due to &quot;passive voice&quot;, and he feels crushed over it. I told him otherwise.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I would be disappointed in the low grade I got if I had worked so hard and produced something I considered so good. But, JRE doesn't stop to think about why he got the grade, or if the grade was warranted. His base premise concerning his belief that he wasn't a good writer was essentially:</p><p>His writing isn't beautiful or elegant.</p><p>My reply: So what? What does that have to do with good writing? If you are writing an essay (which is all our family tends to write‚Äìeven our letters our politicized essays), the beauty of your essay does not spring from your rhetoric, use of syntax, or colorful language (f-to the l33t izz0). The beauty of an essay is in the truth-value, relevance, and significance of the very contents of the essay‚Äìnot the way in which it is said. Wouldn't you prefer (or in fact value) an essay with mere coherence (so, I guess it isn't flowery or aesthetically pleasing) and insightful content than a useless, shallow, and illogical essay that we might consider aesthetically pleasing? The form of an essay has nothing to do with aesthetics‚Äìthe essay exists in virtue of the argument to be made. And, we will soon find, all forms of communication (and writing) have one purpose in mind‚Äìthey all are a type of essay (some are just better essays than others).</p><p>Now, if you have a poor argument, then you have grounds for dismissing an essay as awful, regardless of the other qualities of the essay. The beauty of an essay can only truly be analyzed insofar as it fulfills the form of the essay. Poor arguments translate into ugly essays, while good arguments are beautiful essays</p><p>But, what of the linguistic mechanisms required to transport those beautiful thought-capsules? Obviously, the mechanisms will be valuable insofar as these are necessary in communicating and transporting the ideas and details of arguments. Coherence is the base requirement of communication‚Äìnot aesthetics. I propose that we have a false sense of aesthetics, a twisted sense of beauty, and an ill-conceived notion of the purpose of communicating in general. It is not about the emotions you inspire; emotions that do not stem from rational propositions are meaningless. Communicating is about transporting truth‚Äìall else is secondary, including that which we perceive to be &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot;.</p><p>It reminds me of my principle disagreement with my own &quot;Christianity&quot; professor. He was a mystic and spiritualist‚Äìgenerally irrational. More important to our topic, he could truly impress us with his language of decor while speaking of his beliefs. He was eloquent, but he was very wrong. The lack of truth (which was hidden to most) made for hollow or even√Ç damaging√Ç communications. This false beauty was dangerous!</p><p>Ironically, both our professors are &quot;very close friends&quot;.</p><p>JRE really has taken to Berea more than I did, not because I didn't have a chance, but I think I had a good reason for being so cautious. I√Ç am glad he is leaving that place, he should know he is a good writer and√Ç why he is a good writer (and why√Ç he is not√Ç to be√Ç Berean).√Ç I did not wish to be sucked in by the false prophets‚Äìand believe me, these guys are pro's. Their belief is based too much on emotion, which they problematically use as a justification, as if their feelings had something to do with their rational argument. Sure, they use big words like &quot;Christomimetics&quot;, but they truly lack the fundamental principle behind the &quot;image of Christ&quot;. I remember reading an article by JRE's teacher on &quot;orthodoxy&quot;, and I couldn't help but laugh. Why? Because, this heretic, this...relativist English professor was going to try and preach to me what the &quot;straight path&quot; was? He has no earthly clue; all he has is his emotion. These are well-spoken emo-kids who convert masses into believing that God and religion are mere &quot;mystery&quot;. They are concerned with a spiritual revelation that is far from true belief, from‚Äìorthodoxy and that actual Imago Dei. They pursue some heretical neo-catholicism, which they consider &quot;orthodox&quot; (roflcopter), and use semantics and beautiful language to mask the empty and meaningless &quot;ideas&quot; that they disseminate to their students.</p><p>I can see why students like these teachers. We are taken in by their appearance of intelligence and through the false beauty (aesthetics) of their words. But, their ability to spread heresy within that false beauty is truly dangerous. It is why I do not think so highly of aesthetics in the end (although, I must admit, I do enjoy them, especially when they are used to display the truth).</p><p>The longstanding feud I will have with these....artists is the question of aesthetics. Why pursue beauty? It is not important in and of itself, not outside the context of the truth atleast. Beauty requires relevance, it is only revealed from something much greater‚Äìsomething with a moral purpose.</p><p>And, it is here that their argument unfolds. They seek aesthetic appeal. To them, it is here that words and art, while attempting to communicate truth, are mysteriously mixed with emotional and irrational expression. It is contradictory to the very nature of absolute truth. These professors think of communication in general, as an emotive tool, not as a truth-seeking tool. This is a warped perspective. As they cannot understand the root function of communication, they cannot understand the value of JREmy's thoughts and what he has written.</p><p>JRE's Spanish teacher (my Christianity Professor), held interviews for going to Rome on short term. JRE was denied (not just because he is related to me), but possibly because of one question on his application and in his interview. JREmy explained that his favorite piece of art was &quot;1984&quot; by Orwell. De Rose thought this was odd, and asked JRE for the reasoning behind the answer. My brother did me proud.</p><p>JRE essentially said: &quot;The purpose of art is to communicate truth&quot;. And, in this case, JREmy was fond of the moral truth and ways in which it was communicated in the art piece of his choice (books are a form of art). JRE is correct. He understands WHY we read, why we look at pictures, movies, and listen to music. While words may not be necessary (you can listen to a symphony or observe a painting), the use of words might in fact be the most effective form of communication.</p><p>Of course, De Rose didn't like this. He felt the trip (and life in general) was about finding meaning exclusively through what he considered to be true &quot;art&quot;. But, it is evident that he fails to understand what is &quot;art&quot; means, and the limitations of certain mediums (and the limits of natural human perception/deduction). De Rose thought JREmy should pursue pictures instead. The professor thought this because he didn't understand the limited value of pictures, or even the reason why one would create or observe a picture. He thought communication was meant to inspire emotion, and probably felt that pictures did a better job of this than words.</p><p>They say a picture is worth a 1,000 words...but that is only because people are too lazy to read and too stupid to realize how difficult it is to describe important and complex truths in a picture. Only the immortal genius can look at the world (or a picture) and decipher and deduce the complete meanings of what is around him. Not only is the picture not a medium for the everyday man for the most important truths, I don't think it is possible for our small minds to make such deductions from those pictures when we already have such great difficulty with a much clearer and more effective medium for important and complex truths, words. If you can't understand it in word, how could possibly come to know it through a lesser medium?The picture, to gain any serious meaning, requires too much work for a mere mortal to deduce things from (not that it isn't possible, but rather it probabably isn't worth our time). Words, on the other hand, have the beautiful ability to easily and effectively communicate a truth to even the stupidest people. The written text and spoken word are tools; they are the best mediums for communicating substantial truth to a population. In reality a word is worth a 1,000 pictures to small minded mortals like us. We seek the truth, and in our pursuit, we will be most effective in using the best medium: words. There are very good reasons why God would choose to communicate truths to us in words (no Holy Ghost arguments please, the Holy Spirit guides us toward the Word, grace through undeserved and unjustified emotional pursuit of God‚Äìthis is grace, not justice...for our own pursuit, stick to rationality).</p><p>Our teachers do not agree. They see a meaning deeper than what words can express‚Äìand it is here that they fail. They do not understand the full implication of words. They do not understand absolute truth. They do not understand relevance. They do not understand form, function, and orthodoxy.</p><p>JRE is a good writer because at his core he knows what his teachers do not. He knows the fundamentals, and he understands why we write. For now, maybe he is just longing the bliss of our teachers' ignorance because their path is much easier. It isn't hard to be stupid.</p><p>I don't want a fuzzy picture, I want an immaculate concept! Words paint a much clearer picture than oil on canvas. Mortals should be economical (as we don't have eternity) and realistic in our pursuit of truth. While somehow our foolish professors are blind to the obvious, it is evident that the guiding invisible hand of opportunity and lifenomics has long been persuading us towards mediums which most effectively and efficienty express and imbed in our minds the truth of God, and in this case, the beauty of truth-seeking words in virtue of their orthodoxy, relevance, and truth-value. JRE seeks truth in his writing, and for this, he is a good writer.</p></div>
