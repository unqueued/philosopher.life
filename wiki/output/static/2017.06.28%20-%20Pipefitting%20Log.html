<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I got ahold of AB&amp;T this morning (actually, Johanna called me). I explained the situation. I need a letter, with the letterhead, listing the tools I need. Sweet. I told my teacher, and he was kind of unhappy that it wasn't going through the school, but also that it may send a bad signal to my employer that I don't have the tools already. He suggested I carefully word my request to my employer in this respect. </p><p>I spent the day studying. Chris came in right before lunch. He had already studied but wasn't feeling confident. He took the test. He did okay. We talked about the job. He can't take it.</p><p>The teacher had me continue welding new things to his fabrication. I'm glad he trusts me to do it. I'm happy to get the experience. </p><p>I took the test after lunch. I did well enough. I have one more to go. We agreed to meet next Wednesday on it. I'll be calling in tomorrow since I have many things to do. It doesn't sound like there will be a class next week, or something like that. Whatever. I have one test to take, and I'm gone. </p><p>Also, my teacher told me to provide transcripts of my math classes. He talked to the president of our tech school, and these classes will be &quot;transferred&quot; in to make up for my remaining 6 months. This gives me a diploma. Great.</p><p>I headed home early. I went to a local mechanic explaining that I wanted the car checked out. I really, really need it to work. He told me to bring it in tomorrow.</p><p>When I got home, I called AB&amp;T to gather more information. We really can't go through the school, even if it is their preference. The letter can be e-mailed to her. Further, I need to have it sent to her by the end of the week. Apparently, AB&amp;T is having a major restructuring. Lastly, I volunteered my service for pricing the tools. I know this is a pain in the ass for her, and I wouldn't mind it. I need bids from 3 different suppliers for my list. She gave me license to pick the brand I liked, just as long as I made sure the other bids were higher than the one I really wanted. She said she had to go for the cheapest option of the 3. </p><p>Afterward, I wrote the complete list and the letter, and then called my new boss, Barry. I explained the situation, and he said it was great. He told me to e-mail it to our other boss, Ben (the guy who hired me). I did so, and also told Ben that my friend couldn't take the job (Ben asked). I'm waiting for them to review the list and send the letter before I do any pricing. I'm hoping the list won't make me look bad. I'm also hoping I get it before work begins without a hitch.</p><p>I'm grabbed my transcript. I'm writing my work contact information in the private wiki.</p></div>
