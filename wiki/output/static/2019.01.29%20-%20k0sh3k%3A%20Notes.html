<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Nozick says in the exp machine, there is no meaning; he must be wrong. This is an extremely strong statement in philosophy - internalist/externalist debate, etc. I need transcription - I don't have emotional energy to do it by myself. This is a tool I need. </p><p>There is difference - moral - b/t what Neo does and what Cypher-as-powerful-as-Neo does when both wear Ring of G in virtue of just power. When can make simulation whatever they want to make it - they are the living god inside - they create mythical story of own stories as idealistically as they wish, what kinds of worlds do they build and why? This defines their character. The Ring of Power as Ring of Gyges is impossible to wield for great number of reasons, one of which is that we're finite and can't make infinite computations - or even just computations about something that is simulating ourselves even. It's one of the proofs I have that I do not live in simulation of my own creating and believe in the objective truth: math points and says no matter how large you grow language, you'll never be able to describe everything. You could not simulate in your head yourself, let along yourself-in-a-world. Only a bigger computer can compute the smaller one. At some point, compression will fail to provide anything meaningful and therefore there must be a Master in the Dialectic. </p><p>To me that is a proof of externalism, and that the meaning of the universe cannot reside in me - at least, never fully. It's part of what faith is like; the rational part of us, which needs to be as rational as possible to get the best results. Choose your axioms wisely. </p><p>Instead, I could demonstrate externalism in epistemology and ethics - I am talented at that. I hold a rare belief, and very few people can articulate what I can in the enemy's language. That sounds schizophrenic - like, you believe you have correctly modeled the world; do you really see that? Either you're an idiot-autist who doesn't know how to model, or you're schizophrenic who doesn't know how to lie to themselves, or maybe it's a delusion to see shapes that aren't there. </p><p>I think being inside Nozick's esp machine does produce morally relevant results. I agree to the claim that simulated meaning is still meaningful - there is a meaningful way to talk about meanings in simulations. The source/authority/criterion/unity might be a true contradiction for we finite - it is external to us. The external meaning is the context of all contexts - the thing which gives that which it sublates meaning. And yet the sublatee gives meaning to the sublator, too, somehow - I don't know what that means. It's something like saying circularly perhaps - and I don't know how to bust out of it - that somehow the Good is in us and we're in the Good, and I don't know what emerges from that besides reality itself or something. I don't think that I am only real insofar as the Good simulated me - I don't think that I am just a deterministic cog in the result of a computational machine, that I had no hand in building. I do think I have a certain kind of moral agency and power in even the simulated dialectic that gives rise to a dialectic with the external good. It is a slave-master relationship, and that's ok b/c it's the finite slave vs. the infinite master - and how I suppose how the angel is presented to you at the mountain is going to scale into infinigress. </p><p>To say that this point of view is realist is the faith that is so unpopular to have in contemporary philosophy. Both continental and anayltic approaches will deconstruct using your own criteria - but that's the point Godel is making. He's saying that there's always foundational faith to the rhyzome in language. Those who only believe in their own and reach into subjectivity still are faced w/ choice in whether or not they're going to subjectively choose to believe in the dialectic. This is Pascal's wager. </p><p>I think that Marx's dialectic may fail at metaphysical and metaethical level w/out TFTT faith. If you don't believe in the GR, there is no way to decentrally build a material dialectic that ever escapes the state of nature dialectic, that doesn't devolve into the state of nature w/out the faith in the possibility of us being better and that is the necessary condition for us acting upon the GR. We have to have a reason to think that others are free enough to engage in the CI internally and the OP externally in not making an exception of themselves beyond the practically ideal of the ideal Platonic contextualist perspective. However it is that the objective is scaled down to and particularized to a context. YOu have to believe that the Good, the Right, and the Beautiful are real and external to you - it's faith. You are never going to be able to hold absolute proof - the only proof you can generate for yourself is that it's a question you can never be certain about.</p><hr><p>What the unforgivable sin is, is programming yourself in such a way that you can never evaluate the possiblity of CI or OP or externalism of these as valid programs to run on your computer. This is a question of Free Will. It seems like non-trivial possiblity that we can look at the identity of people - the trees, the possible worlds that branch from their identity - and see that there are possible worlds in which they are presented w/ crisis opportunities to integrte or desintegrate their Kierkegaardian computers. It is possible for them to radically alter who they are to some non-trivial extent. ONe of the problems w/ predicting behavior is that ppl become convinced they are merely deterministic statistic. Most ppl actually are incompatablilits - many of whom trick themselves into becoming compatibilitsts. It's extremely convenient - it's the kind of faith in free will that relativisitcally enables selective lack of accountability. We get to deny our agency in compatibilism whenever it suits us, including this variability. I'm just not free to think that I'm not free. The best way to force oneself to assume that something possible is impossible is to beg the questions in the necessity of our axioms. We are finite Turing machines. We're deeply flawed ones built on hardware which radically biases our Beyesian perception. There are rationalist conditions, starting material, to reason probabilistically. </p><hr></div>
