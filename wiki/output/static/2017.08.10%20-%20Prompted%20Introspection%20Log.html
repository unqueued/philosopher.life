<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>I dedicate this page to my friend <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ALM.html">ALM</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2018.12.03</sup></button></em></p><h2 class="">What do you think of the similarities between your relationship with your biological donors/parents and their relationships with their donors/parents?</h2><p>It is clear that at some point, my donors had a serious problem with their own donors up until a few years ago. </p><p>My hypothesis is that they are intelligent enough to be faced (to some extent) with the fact that they aren't all that much better than their own donors. The thought horrifies them. It's time to rationalize and confabulate in that fight or flight mode. </p><p>Will I suffer the same fate? Would my children suffer the same fate?</p><p>How much of this is a pattern? To that, I must be curious and yet skeptical. Be a wise-pattern seeker and analyst. </p><p>I have a very hard time understanding my children's (and to some great extent my own) futures. I'm really, really bad at it sometimes. </p><p>One polite way out of this mess is to consider other aspects of the narrative. Consider, for example, that my donors are more educated about ethics, metaphysics, politics, religions, and a wide variety of social considerations than their donors. Perhaps that trend continues.</p><p>Truly, these people have taught themselves so much. I tell you, I know scholars when I see them. But, I know many scholars who are fundamentally wrong. I know it as surely as the air I breathe. Even people as smart as you and your donors make mistakes; huge ones, life-altering, existentially defining huge ones. </p><p>It is possible that you should forgive your parents for their mistakes, however large they might be. If they knew better, they would think as you do. It is okay to admit that you know more than your parents, that you have earned the right to radically disagree with them. It's okay to disagree when you know you are right; your belief is extremely justified. You're socially slower, and you shouldn't feel bad that it takes you longer to understand the world, others, and yourself. You are smart, crazy fucking smart, but you are also autistic. Don't feel bad; it's not your fault that you are born autistic (just as it wasn't up you the degrees and kinds in which your genetics contributed to your intelligences). You really are doing the best you can with what you have. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>: You know I vote for forgiveness. Forgive yourself and your parents. It's just that easy.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>: And, you know I do not in this case. Forgiveness is not always morally obligated of you. I don't think it is here. Your move, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>: Forgiveness does not mean you have to forget. It doesn't mean that you have to trust. Forgiveness means letting go. </p><p>Let go of it, h0p3. </p><p>Let it go. It's the prudential thing to do. Don't you see the utility in it, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>? Don't you see how rational it is? You are a man of integrity, right? Be rational.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>: Fine, Kant, I'm listening.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>: My parents may be wrong for better reasons. You don't have to accept the Redpill. It may not be prudent. Can you split the Redpill and just take the right half? Can you somehow unsee what you have seen, or resee it? Can you reinterpret the world, again, as you done so many times before?</p><p>It seems like you gain the chance to forgive Humanity too, at least to some extent. Isn't this the obvious best way?
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>: Why do you forgive your wife, but not yourself and your donors?
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>: Touch√©. But, oh my Virtue believer, you are vicious in this respect. I just happen to have a better lens than you do. </p><p><code>/adhominem-attack</code> </p><p>Kant wields it just as well as you do. There are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Purple%2520Pills.html">Purple Pills</a> to take (oh snap, RIPOSTED, bitch!). This is the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="metamodern.html">metamodern</a> move, my friend. You get to have your cake and eat it too. I can agree to much of your view without taking up your conclusions. </p><p>Oh, and don't forget that the free part of you isn't the frontal lobe rational part of you, or even necessarily the most classically utilitarianly trained rational parts of your fastmind. Oh, my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Combatibilist%2520Ghost%2520in%2520a%2520Shell.html">Combatibilist Ghost in a Shell</a>, you cannot escape me. </p><p>Don't you see that your calculus is wrong, mentat?  I get to use the same rhetoric that you do. Remember: I'm empathizing with you. Call me names, and I get to call you names. =) Hello, sweetheart. Here, take this magic metamodern purple pill. </p><p>Stop pursuing certainty in its various incarnations (it's rational to do so), and sometimes stop being so certain (it's rational to do so). You are engaged in a dialectic. Metamodernism buys the basic concept of the Dialectic, in Humanity and individual humans. </p><p>Humanity is participating in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Great%2520Human%2520Conversation.html">The Great Human Conversation</a>. The agent, Humanity, is what we are a part of. We are one of the atoms to that ocean of molecules and more complex structures through time and space. When <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> empathizes with its parts enough to engage in a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Dialectic.html">Dialectic</a>, it oscillates between various incarnations between the Fast and Slow minds of its constituents as a whole. Hence, Metamodernism is the Purple Pill. It attempts to answer the Dialectic itself in a meta way. </p><p>We exist as a dialectic. You are forever a slave, a slave which hopes to have an influence upon our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Master.html">Master</a>. </p><p>Golden ruled!
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>: I actually am not sure how the golden rule works. I am open to the possibility that none of the paradoxes I can come up with fundamentally rule out any good, well-intentioned, normative spirit of the law. You are correct. If you can prove me wrong, I should listen. I agree I may be vicious.</p><p>I must warn you, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Master.html">Master</a>, the Dialectic you are having between <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a> is an autistic person holding two socket puppets in his hands. </p><p>Consciousness is reducible to one mind listening and responding to, weighing, analyzing,  choosing amongst, and acting upon the dialectic struggle between two or more minds. You are the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Master.html">Master</a>, and we may always remain two or more parts of you. This is not a threat, but an explanation. You are whatever is free in us. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Master.html">Master</a> is our <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Compatibilist%2520Ghost%2520in%2520the%2520Shell.html">Compatibilist Ghost in the Shell</a>, the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Self-Programmer%2520in%2520Chief.html">Self-Programmer in Chief</a>, the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Autonomous%2520Self-Legislator.html">Autonomous Self-Legislator</a>.

</p></blockquote><p>So, your parents have wronged you. Stop thinking about it. Let it go. Find a way to just move past it.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2018.12.03 : </span> The irony of this is heartbreaking. I hope to let go in time, though that may be difficult to do with integrity. There is a difference between forgetting, ignoring, and no longer feeling the pain of it.</sub></p></div>
