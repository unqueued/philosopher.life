<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Wittgenstein was wrong (a box of contradictions). As brilliant as his understanding of language may have been, his dissection of &quot;form&quot; is clearly flawed (upon which rests a great deal of his theory). Form is pure logic, it is required as a base for meaning. F-ness must exist, or we have no true reference and no value base from which to communicate or think. Wittgenstein, like many others, does not understand this. Of course, we can all deny that &quot;metaphysical object in the heavens&quot; which contains the truth-meaning of X, but they go on to deny even a simplistic understanding of form as a tool to categorize (which form is more than just a categorizer). The truth is right after a &quot;body in the heavens&quot;...it is still a concrete necessity of the universe.</p><p>Ironically, his one base example used to defeat the validity of &quot;form&quot; is...(drum roll), the &quot;form of gaming&quot;. I own this guy. I can certainly see why he made the mistakes he made though. His questions regarding how a game could possibly have a form stemmed from some complex issues. My essay answers his questions, restoring the dignity of the form. The denial of &quot;form&quot; (or as my dad would prefer, &quot;logos&quot;) is founded upon a lack of disciplined thinking. Moving from &quot;scissorness&quot; to &quot;gameness&quot; is a perfect example of that slippery slope where we can think that &quot;forms&quot; just might not be a universal necessity. It is easy to identify and validate &quot;form&quot; in the context of something as simple as scissors; but it becomes so complex and difficult to understand the form of other things (like game) that even the best philosophers of this century will give up, and consequently, they deny the the universality of form. Essentially, whether they can identify the form of something or not is irrelevant to the fact that forms must exist.</p><p>The trick to the form is that is more than mere semantics or words. We can't just think of form as a way to categorize things, it must be more than that if we wish to actually reference something. F-ness requires it is real if we assume what we say makes sense and has an honest reference. We beg the question of forms, but we fail to realize what we have begged. When you say &quot;white&quot; you are referring to &quot;white-ness&quot;...either a.) you aren't thinking of anything actual, and what you've said is completely non-sensical, or b.) you have referred to something real. For any meaning to exist, you'll need to assume the latter. Tough beans.</p><p>This issue, alongside the books I've been reading and the essay I'm working on, brings me to an odd disagreement that I have with my dad. It is this issue of &quot;semantics&quot;...</p><p>Don't get me wrong, my dad is as smart as they come‚Äì seriously, he is brilliant. He has a wealth of knowledge in many areas which he can use to synthesize and deduce conclusions which can be fairly extraordinary. So, when my dad says something, I tend to listen (and think). While I've never fully understood the problem he has with what he refers to as &quot;semantics&quot;, I'll do my best to describe and consider it. (Beware strawman!)</p><p>Formally speaking, semantics (ironically) means: the study of language meaning. (Of course, debating the meaning of semantics has to be the funniest thing I've heard all day.)</p><p>My dad knows the dictionary meaning of semantics, but when he says it, he uses it in a pejorative sense‚Äì much like how one dismisses an argument as mere &quot;rhetoric&quot; (rather than substance), my dad (like many of us) describes some arguments as merely &quot;semantics&quot;. There are good reasons to do this, but I think we have to be cautious in our use of this word. In his uhh...tone of disapproval (which is most often deserved), as he calls out &quot;semantics&quot;, he seems to point toward a type of argument that is inauthentic, invalid or false, usually one blurred by ambiguous wording, which lacks logic, relevancy and true meaning. Clearly, he doesn't mean the dictionary meaning at all, he just means to say that the speaker is twisting word meanings or being ambiguous to arrange a false argument in order to justify something that dad believes can't logically be justified. Namely, if we corrected the &quot;semantic&quot; issues, the argument falls apart. Clearly, every false (whether valid or invalid) argument in the universe is based upon what he refers to as &quot;semantics&quot;.</p><p>I think his favorite example might be this guy we laugh at: Paul Tillich. Ever read something from this P.T.? P.T.'s arguments are like water. There is nothing solid to grasp. While we might be able to chart out a few syllogisms, and definitely see the 1+1=2's and the If A then B; A; therefore B's, we have a huge problem with the very meanings, definitions, and words used in those false syllogisms. P.T. never goes to fully desribe or defend the very meaning of some variables in his equations. Because his variables aren't fully fleshed out or meaningful, his greater argument made cannot have meaning either. P.T. rides his use of &quot;semantics&quot; or unjustified redefining and use of terminology to lend false authority and validity to his end arguments. It is easy to see he has poor arguments because it is easy to see how he weasels his way into false or useless word meanings.</p><p>In reality, when we call something &quot;semantics&quot;, we just mean that the meaning of one of the premises is distorted, illogical, or meaningless. While the argument can be logically &quot;valid&quot; in some broad sense, its conclusion (the sum of the premises) is false because at least one of the premises is false. Or, in other words, semantics, in the way dad uses it, must really just point toward any untrue-valid argument by definition, as it is obvious that every untrue-valid argument is flawed not because of any strict validity argument, but rather because of some illogical or meaningless piece of language in one of the premises.</p><p>For example:</p><p>If A, then B,
B
Therefore, A.</p><p>This is an invalid argument, even if Premises 1, 2, and even the end result of 3 are true. Or, to fill in the gaps with an example, we can say:</p><p>If it is raining, then it is wet outside.
It is wet outside
ConClusion: It is raining,</p><p>Invalid. Clearly there is some causal link that must be made from 1+2-&gt;Conclusion. But, stand that aside, and realize that this is in valid in virtue of that broken causal link (so we can't claim &quot;Therefore&quot;), and we can easily see that 1, 2, and 3 could be true, we just can't deduce 3 from 1 and 2.</p><p>This is the invalid argument, and it is not what my dad means by semantics. Dad means that an argument is valid but false. So, we start with a logic-shell that works (making it deceptive, as we want to think of valid arguments as true ones when we aren't completely disciplined in our thinking), but still have a false argument due to semantics. The perfect example is a counterfactual.</p><p>If santa clause is real, then X.
Santa Clause is real.
Therefore, X.</p><p>It doesn't matter what X is, X could mean anything, even something illogical. Why? Because the &quot;if&quot; can never be true, i.e. it is semantically non-sensical, we can say whatever we want about X and it doesn't matter. A person can justify X if they can make you accept the object of the &quot;If&quot;. All arguments break down into base syllogisms. In the end, you have to go claim by claim, word by word, and assume (and be willing to defend) each meaning. This is just a requisite to logical argument. Our disagreement with the above is not from an initial validity issue, clearly it adds up, rather it is the false meaning placed in a premises (namely premise 2).</p><p>&quot;Santa Clause is real&quot; is such a base premise (basest of basest, as premises are actually conlusions themselves formed from sub-premises, and so on and so forth until we reach statements like X is true). Most just shorten this argument to &quot;Santa Clause&quot; and the &quot;is real&quot; is silent (and assumed). Obviously, &quot;Santa Clause&quot; lacks meaning, it does not align with reality. This is what dad must mean by semantics. In virtue of a distortive, ambiguous, or meaningless word(s), one or more premises is false, thus the conclusion isn't justified. Clearly, this is simplified, but every &quot;semantic&quot; argument MUST boil down to something of this nature.</p><p>I think I prefer just to say that a premise is false. It is clearer to think in this fashion, but much more difficult because we will be asked to show which exact premise is false and why (something we aren't always capable of doing). Saying &quot;semantics&quot; is short, but not very descriptive when you haven't fully fleshed out its meaning to your audience. I think we should leave the meaning of &quot;semantics&quot; as it is...a purely good and reputable idea. An undeniably true and necessary concept. The denial of true semantics is the denial of form and absolute, DISTINCTIVE truth, which is just relativism (which I've deduced is undisciplined thinking in any respect). Dad, of course, would never deny true semantics. He has the same passionate hate as I do for poorly made, ambiguous, and especially deceitful arguments that justify corruption, sin and irrationality. Semantics is clearly necessary, it is the basis for all argument, as we cannot have premises without words and absolute meanings to construct those arguments. So why do we say &quot;semantics&quot; instead of just explaining why an argument is wrong?</p><p>Clarity and distinction are not some unnecessary hairsplitting. They are required. Unfortunately, it can take a great deal of time and effort.</p><p>I think sometimes calling an argument &quot;semantics&quot; can be used in situations where we don't have the exact reason why we believe a conclusion isn't justified and we don't want to spend the time to find one.√Ç Both dad and I sometimes refer to things as &quot;semantics&quot; without fully having justified what we mean or why we think an argument is false. Often, this is because don't know the end answer, or because we can't articulate the answer, or because don't have the patience to truly dissect an opposing argument correctly. We have to be careful in how we dismiss arguments, sometimes we haven't dug deep enough to honestly make those claims.</p><p>Lol, wow, this brings back memories. I remember before dad left for Thailand that he offended me one day by saying I was just using semantics. Of course, as a philosopher (and somewhat of a literalist), I took that as an unfair dismissal of both my argument and even my life-pursuit. I don't think dad meant the latter. But, I'll be glad to clear up what he means by semantics.</p><p>Even the subject of &quot;philosophy&quot; is a shrouded mystery with my dad. Sometimes he likes it, other times he treats it as heresy (I'm no different). He is a pragmatist. (strawman?) I think he doesn't always see the point in pursuing ideas if it doesn't show obvious physical results. The actual pursuit of truth for the pursuit of truth may not always seem reasonable to my dad. And why wouldn't he think so? Ideas need to be useful to a utilitarian! =) Ah, but that is another topic for another day.</p><p>Now, of course, I do not want to be accused of grandstanding or limiting what is posted on my blog to only my arguments without giving anyone a chance to disagree. I don't mean it as some unfair exhibition of my thoughts. Honestly, I write whether anyone reads or not just so I can organize my thoughts (although, I do a piss poor job). Feel free to post replies!</p><p>Oh yeah, Umlaut is a funny word. I think of a german thug bellowing it. Wittgenstein was a thug. Ghett-o-matic.</p></div>
