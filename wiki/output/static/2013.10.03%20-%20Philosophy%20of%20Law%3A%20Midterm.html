<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Part I </p><p>1.</p><p>Pre-legal societies have (at least) three critical defects which prevent them from having genuine legal systems, and secondary rule (which pre-legal societies lack, but are found in genuine legal systems), are the solution to those defects.</p><p>The first defect is that pre-legal societies are bound to be uncertain about primary rules. People may not know what the primary are or what the rules mean. The secondary rule of recognition corrects this defect. The rule of recognition is a secondary rule which is foundational to a genuine legal system, as it gives some set of officials the power to decide what are valid legal rules. The rule of recognition contains a certain hierarchal set of criteria which outline the validity of laws. When the rule of recognition is practiced and accepted by officials (which is the only time there is a rule of recognition), any rule which satisfies the criteria contained in the rule of recognition is a valid law in the legal system. The rule of recognition is supposed to diffuse defects of uncertainty concerning validity of law to some significant extent, but in practice, it doesn‚Äôt completely resolve all uncertainty. Genuine legal systems, with the rule of recognition, do seem at least better (to some extent) than pre-legal systems with respect to the problem of uncertainty.</p><p>The second defect is that pre-legal societies are static. There aren‚Äôt mechanisms for changing laws. These mechanisms are necessary, on Hart‚Äôs view, to have a genuine legal system. The secondary rules of change correct this defect by giving some group of officials the power to change the duty imposing rules. We should note that this rule of change is connected to the rule of recognition because if you give a group of officials power to change primary laws, then you have to recognize that these legislators are a source of legal validity. If they follow the right procedure, then they‚Äôve created new or different rules of our legal system.</p><p>The third defect of pre-legal societies is decentralized enforcement, as they lack effective, efficient, and consistent interpretation of laws. The secondary rules of adjudication correct this defect by granting judges the power to adjudicate or settle disagreements or disputes over laws. Like the rules of change, the people with this authority to adjudicate are recognized as a valid source of law, and hence it could just be seen as a complex expression of the rule of recognition. When a judge issues a decision resolving a dispute, that interpretation is a valid law (or modification of law, etc.).</p><p>Thus, in a sense, these defects which prevent pre-legal societies from having genuine legal systems are corrected by the use of a complex rule of recognition (which expresses all the secondary rules). Ultimately, pre-legal systems lack a fully expressed rule of recognition. These societies cannot answer the question: ‚ÄúHow do you go about figuring out whether or not a rule is valid or not?‚Äù The inability to answer that question is the critical flaw of pre-legal societies, and the solution to that flaw, which is part of definition of genuine legal systems, is the reason why genuine legal systems might be seen as better than pre-legal systems.</p><p>Pre-legal systems are not genuine because they lack secondary ‚Äúpower-conferring‚Äù rules, even if they possess primary ‚Äúduty imposing‚Äù rules, and thus they lack the necessary union between primary and secondary rules which Hart requires for genuine legal systems. Most importantly, pre-legal systems lack a fully expressed rule of recognition and the corresponding officials who practice and accept it. These pre-legal societies cannot answer the question: ‚ÄúHow do you go about figuring out whether or not a rule is valid or not?‚Äù Genuine legal systems, by definition, can answer that question.</p><p>Only (1) when the rules that are recognized as legally valid by the officials are genuinely complied with by everyone in the society, and (2) when the complex rule of recognition (which expresses of all secondary rules) is accepted and practiced by legal officials, does a genuine legal system exist. These conditions are not satisfied by pre-legal systems, and thus these primitive societies don‚Äôt have genuine legal systems, according to Hart.</p><p>2.</p><p>The general population need not take the valid laws of a genuine legal system to be rules for themselves, as in, they don‚Äôt have an internal perspective of these laws. Obeying laws, not as rules, in this sense is sheep-like.</p><p>It is possible for there to be a genuine legal system where the officials are all engaged in this social practice (as to how they identify what counts as a valid rule), and they make immoral laws, and the ordinary citizens might be ignorant of the secondary rules (don‚Äôt now much about the legal structure), and they may only comply because they fear punishment (not because these laws are rules or reasons for their own actions), and so the masses of the citizens can be like sheep. They don‚Äôt know how it works, and they can just comply out of fear of punishment, and this is unhealthy. Yet, it is valid.</p><p>In pre-legal societies, the standards of behavior are generally accepted and practiced, often from an internal perspective. If they didn‚Äôt, then those wouldn‚Äôt be the standards of behavior in pre-legal societies. Pre-legal societies are far less likely to incur this cost of having an unhealthy, sheep-like population.</p><p>In addition, the ‚Äúcost‚Äù or risk that one runs from stepping up from pre-legal system to a genuine legal system is that officials can have legal power to oppress the population in cases where pre-legal systems relying upon primary rules alone would not. Primary rules in pre-legal system often seem to require the general support of population who follows these primary rules. This need not be case in a genuine legal system. I believe pre-legal societies have a greater chance of having moral norms match primary rules, and perhaps seeing fewer deeply immoral rules (such as what might come out of a Nazi regime) than genuine legal systems.</p><p>3.</p><p>The rule of recognition is a secondary rule which is foundational to a genuine legal system, as it gives some set of officials the power to decide what are valid legal rules. The secondary rules of change are connected to the rule of recognition because if you give a group of officials power to change primary laws, then you have to recognize that these legislators are a source of legal validity. If they follow the right procedure, then they‚Äôve created new or different rules of our legal system. The secondary rules of adjudication also confer power, namely giving judges the power to adjudicate or settle disagreements or disputes over laws. When a judge issues a decision resolving a dispute, that interpretation is a valid law (or modification of law, etc.). Like the rules of change, the people with this authority to adjudicate are recognized as a valid source of law, and hence it could just be seen as a complex expression of the rule of recognition.</p><p>The rule of recognition, at least on Hart‚Äôs view, does not impose duties on those who are given power. If an official doesn‚Äôt follow the correct procedure for generating/modifying/adjudicating a law, then they have just wasted their time (and probably the time of other officials). They aren‚Äôt necessarily duty-bound to follow that procedure though.</p><p>4.</p><p>In the practice theory of rules, officials are cooperating together. Their work is highly integrated, and so Coleman seems to think something more arises out of this, in terms of expectations, than Hart. Hart doesn‚Äôt think power-conferring rules impose duties. We can think of the process for generating laws as a kind of hypothetical imperative - if you want to make this valid law, then follow this procedure. Officials have power to follow the procedure, to satisfy the hypothetical imperative, but they don‚Äôt have a duty to do so. Coleman disagrees. He thinks the rule of recognition and power-conferring rules do impose duties. The idea is that you have a duty to exercise your power in the proper way. If you didn‚Äôt do your duty, you‚Äôd be punished by the other officials. This adherence makes sure everyone is cooperating and following precedent. Note that Coleman can do that without saying that officials have duties to make morally good laws, rather they just need to make laws.</p><p>5.</p><p>We must always remember that the existence of genuine government, according to Hart, rests upon two minimal necessary and sufficient conditions (I‚Äôm going to repeat myself on this test, I fear). Only (1) when the rules that are recognized as legally valid by the officials are genuinely complied with by everyone in the society, and (2) when the complex rule of recognition (which expresses of all secondary rules) is accepted and practiced by legal officials, does a genuine legal system exist.</p><p>In the case of a foreign invasion, many problems might generate grey, unclear areas, and we might not easily be able to identify whether or not these 2 conditions are met, and essentially, whether or not there is a genuine government.</p><p>People might not be following the laws in general that are recognized by the foreign government. This would make it so the first condition isn‚Äôt satisfied.</p><p>To what extent do these people need to follow the laws in order to satisfy the first condition? I have no idea.</p><p>Who are the real officials? The locals in exile or the foreign officials?</p><p>What if the both sets of officials generated exactly the same primary laws (but each had their own different rule of recognition), and the people followed those laws? Are there two governments over the same region (unlikely!)?</p><p>Normally, we‚Äôd expect a transition in officials to require certain secondary rules which enable or specify that transfer of power. That isn‚Äôt what is happening in this case. Would it be valid for new legal systems to just simply ‚Äútake over‚Äù? I think this is connected to the problem of how legal systems even come into existence. It is unclear which comes first, officials or the rules which make them officials. We need a timeline to make sense of this, but it is quite unclear.</p><p>I honestly don‚Äôt know how to tell if a government has been restored other than pointing to the two conditions. If the two conditions are met, then I have to say that on Hart‚Äôs theory, a genuine legal system has been restored.</p><p>Part 2 (1st question set)</p><p>The rule of recognition is a secondary rule which is foundational to a genuine legal system, as it gives some set of officials the power to decide what are valid legal rules. The rule of recognition contains a certain hierarchal set of criteria which outline the validity of laws. When the rule of recognition is practiced and accepted by officials (which is the only time there is a rule of recognition), any rule which satisfies the criteria contained in the rule of recognition is a valid law in the legal system. The rule of recognition is supposed to diffuse defects of uncertainty concerning validity of law to some significant extent, but in practice, it doesn‚Äôt completely resolve all uncertainty.</p><p>The rule of recognition is ultimate in the sense that there is nothing behind it which validates it, at least on Hart‚Äôs view. Every other rule can trace their validity to the rule of recognition. We might ask why X is a valid rule, and point to Y, and then we might ask why Y is valid, and so on. The rule of recognition is the stopping point (so we don‚Äôt hit a regress). The rule of recognition sits at the foundation of legal validity. Apparently, we can‚Äôt effectively ask and answer the question, ‚Äúwhat makes the rule of recognition legally valid?‚Äù.</p><p>As to how we know when there is a real rule of recognition, there are two perspectives one may take to examine it. One perspective is external, descriptive, and concerned with objective observation of practices of officials, and the other is internal, subjective, and reflective (from the view of the officials). These dual perspectives are significant to the rule of recognition‚Äôs existence. If officials don‚Äôt accept (from an internal perspective) or aren‚Äôt engaged in the practice of the rule of recognition (from an external perspective), then it doesn‚Äôt exist.</p><p>I said before that we can‚Äôt find any other law which validates the rule of recognition. Given this claim, I‚Äôm not really sure that we can claim the rule of recognition is a valid law, at least not directly in the same way (or for the same reasons as why) we think of non-ultimate laws as valid laws. It seems to have a lot of characteristics of laws, but the ultimacy issue makes it quite unclear. My charitable intuition is to say that the rule of recognition is a valid law, even though it isn‚Äôt validated by any other law. After all, it would seem odd to trace the validity of all others to a rule which wasn‚Äôt itself a valid law. I think we don‚Äôt know why the rule of recognition is a valid law in Hart‚Äôs theory other than explaining how integral it is to the very concept of law. Perhaps the officials validate the rule of recognition, but then a lot of worries come out of this. If the rule of recognition is what makes the officials official enough to validate laws, and officials are what make the rule of recognition valid, then it isn‚Äôt clear which comes first (or how genuine governments can begin).</p><p>Setting that matter aside, while the existence of the rule of recognition is foundational to genuine legal systems, a bit more is required in order to have a genuine legal system. Specifically, only (1) when the rules that are recognized as legally valid by the officials are genuinely complied with by everyone in the society, and (2) when the complex rule of recognition (which expresses of all secondary rules) is accepted and practiced by legal officials, does a genuine legal system exist.</p><p>One interesting problem which falls out of these conditions is that there can be valid duty imposing laws, which are rules in the eyes of the officials, which are not followed by the general population. We must remember that a valid law comes from a genuine legal system. A genuine legal system can validate many laws. As long as this set of valid laws is generally followed, even if a particular law isn‚Äôt generally followed, then the first minimal necessary and sufficient condition will be met. Assuming both conditions are met (and I think we should assume the second condition is met, else we couldn‚Äôt call these valid laws at all), then the genuine legal system remains intact, and thus the law it validated, which is not obeyed by the general population, remains valid.</p><p>I said before that the rule of recognition contains a set of criteria for determining what counts as a valid law. Crucially, these criteria can conflict with each, and in order to make them coherent and resolve these conflicts, there must be a hierarchy to them, a priority generated by the highest criterion. The supreme criterion is contained in the rule of recognition; it is (as its name suggest) the criterion with the highest priority; and it is the final deciding criteria for sorting out conflicts amongst the other criteria.</p><p>The rule of recognition and the supreme criterion of validity peel become distinguished more clearly in some cases than in others. In the case of Austin‚Äôs sovereign, these concepts are tightly knit, but in the case of the U.S., we can see how these concepts peel part. For the U.S., the rule of recognition is a combination of the internal beliefs and the external practices of U.S. government officials in a very broad sense. The supreme criterion, however, is far more specific. The constitution serves (arguably) serves as the supreme criterion for the U.S., since all other officials and laws are (eventually) limited, prioritized, and shaped by it.</p><p>It is, however, clear that the U.S. has a supreme criterion, although it doesn‚Äôt have a sovereign (by Austin‚Äôs definition). This is the a major reason as to why we can separate the rule of recognition so clearly from the supreme criterion in the case of the U.S. Austin‚Äôs sovereign, because it requires a sovereign, does not make this distinction as clearly. Before I go any further in explaining why the U.S. legal system doesn‚Äôt have a sovereign, I need to define the Austinian sovereign.</p><p>Austin‚Äôs sovereign is a legally unlimited entity (person or single assembly of people) with the power to issue commands or coercive orders which impose legal duties or obligations on individuals in a particular geographical region. On this model, every genuine legal system has a sovereign, and everyone in the sovereign‚Äôs domain or region habitually obeys the sovereign, but the sovereign does not habitually obey anyone else. A sovereign seems to be the minimal necessary and sufficient conditions for a genuine legal system in this model.</p><p>The U.S. doesn‚Äôt have an Austinian sovereign (although, I think a good case could be made that there is a non-Austinian sovereign). Nobody meets those conditions in the U.S. The U.S. doesn‚Äôt have a sovereign at its foundation ‚Äì Hart thinks something else is at the foundation.</p><p>Unlike the Austin‚Äôs model, Hart‚Äôs theory does not take this narrow conception of a sovereign to be necessary for genuine legal systems or laws. On Hart‚Äôs theory, laws are not simply the coercive commands of a sovereign; rather, legal obligations originate in social rules (where ‚Äúrule‚Äù is a technical term of art for Hart). Further, while laws can impose duties or obligations (which is the only possibility in Austin‚Äôs model), they can also confer power (which is not accounted for within Austin‚Äô model). Genuine legal systems can‚Äôt exist on primary laws alone (which is the only kind of command given by a sovereign), as there must be power-conferring rules which enable laws to be created, changed, abolished, adjudicated, and validated.</p><p>Hart‚Äôs unified rules and rule followers (especially the officials), replace the sovereign as the foundation to genuine legal systems. A genuine legal system or law, on Hart‚Äôs theory, stems from the union of two kinds of rules ‚Äì primary, duty imposing rules and secondary, power-conferring rules. As I said before, only (1) when the rules that are recognized as legally valid by the officials are genuinely complied with by everyone in the society, and (2) when the complex rule of recognition (which expresses of all secondary rules) is accepted and practiced by legal officials, does a genuine legal system exist. So, instead of a sovereign being at the foundation of what might be minimally necessary and sufficient to a genuine legal system, Hart substitutes an entirely different set of conditions.</p><p>He would say the U.S. doesn‚Äôt have a sovereign, but it does have a genuine government, and thus it meets his conditions. There are officials who accept and practice the rule of recognition, a supreme criterion in that rule, namely the constitution, and the U.S. population generally follows the primary laws made by those officials. The foundation of the U.S. government is thus not a sovereign, and on Hart‚Äôs view, it is instead replaced with these other more nuanced concepts.</p><hr><p>1. In his book The Concept of Law, HLA Hart distinguishes between habits of behavior and rules. Briefly explain the distinction.</p><p>Habits of behavior are a convergence or pattern of people‚Äôs behavior. Breaking a habit of behavior does not result in criticism. For example, eating pizza on Friday‚Äôs might be a habit of yours, but if you break that habit, you won‚Äôt be chastised for it. A habit is not something we need be conscious of, taught, or pressured into conforming to.</p><p>In contrast, Hart‚Äôs rules are the kind of social conventions which would be seen as wrong to break. Breaking a rule is met with punishment, criticism, and/or pressures to obey. For example, taking candy from a random child on the street would break some set of social rules for which one would be criticized or punished. We should take care to recognize that this is rule breaking in a legal positivist context, and so this example isn‚Äôt necessarily an issue of immorality, but rather breaking a widely recognized social convention.</p><p>While both habits of behavior and rules seem to demonstrate a general convergence of behavior (which may initially make them appear similar), descriptively-speaking, we feel normatively bound by rules in a way that we are not bound in the case of mere habits of behavior.</p><p>Following a habit is, in some sense, an unreflective procedure which can be predicted, described, or understood entirely from an external perspective. In contrast, rules are more than mere habits, and must be understood, evaluated, and followed from a critical reflective attitude, an internal point of view. The rule follower feels justifiably criticized when deviating from a rule because they feel they ought to follow the rule. Again, this is not a moral realist claim that the person is actually obligated (which is against the logical positivist thesis), rather it is just a description of how the rule follower feels or believes.</p><p>In contrast to mere habits, having the right kind of motivation is key notion for defining Hart‚Äôs idea of a rule. The rule follower, according to Hart, is not motivated simply out of fear of punishment; rather the rule follower sees the rule as being normative in itself (I don‚Äôt think this is so obvious). Hart wants to distinguish doing something as a result of feeling obliged out of notion of self-interest and doing something because you feel you ought to do something (what he thinks is a genuine obligation). Maybe this distinction isn‚Äôt really successful.</p><p>Psychopaths, who presumably lack the kind of reflective, internal point of view and motivational requirements for being a rule follower, seem to be an interesting case in which to distinguish habits of behavior and rules. If a psychopath can‚Äôt enter into this internal attitude (as some folks argue), and he doesn‚Äôt take the rule to really be normative, then it isn‚Äôt a genuine rule for him. He cannot adopt rules, but he can, however, still have mere habits of behavior. He could appear to be following rules, but since he lacks this internal perspective, his behavior would amount to, at best, a habit.</p><p>The rule of recognition is that social practice and accepted set of beliefs of officials which make them officials.</p><p>2. A key element of the simple imperative theory of law, which Hart rejects, is that a sovereign always lies at the foundation of any legal system, Define what is meant by the &quot;sovereign.&quot; What replaces the sovereign in Hart‚Äôs own theory of law?</p><p>The Simple Imperative Model‚Äôs sovereign is a legally unlimited entity (person or single assembly of people) with the power to issue commands or coercive orders which impose legal duties or obligations on individuals in a particular geographical region. On this model, every genuine legal system has a sovereign, and everyone in the sovereign‚Äôs domain or region habitually obeys the sovereign, but the sovereign does not habitually obey anyone else. A sovereign seems to be the minimal necessary and sufficient conditions for a genuine legal system in this model.</p><p>Unlike the Simple Imperative Model, Hart‚Äôs theory does not take this narrow conception of a sovereign to be necessary for genuine legal systems or laws. On Hart‚Äôs theory, laws are not simply the coercive commands of a sovereign; rather, legal obligations originate in social rules (where ‚Äúrule‚Äù is a technical term of art for Hart). Further, while laws can impose duties or obligations (which is the only possibility in the Simple Imperative Model), they can also confer power (which is not accounted for within the Simple Imperative Model). Genuine legal systems can‚Äôt exist on primary laws alone (which is the only kind of command given by a sovereign in the Simple Imperative Model), as there must be power-conferring rules which enable laws to be created, changed, abolished, adjudicated, and validated.</p><p>Hart‚Äôs unified rules and rule followers (especially the officials), replace the sovereign as the foundation to genuine legal systems. A genuine legal system or law, on Hart‚Äôs theory, stems from the union of two kinds of rules ‚Äì primary, duty imposing rules and secondary, power-conferring rules. Only (1) when the rules that are recognized as legally valid by the officials are genuinely complied with by everyone in the society, and (2) when the complex rule of recognition (which expresses of all secondary rules) is accepted and practiced by legal officials, does a genuine legal system exist. So, instead of a sovereign being at the foundation of what might be minimally necessary and sufficient to a genuine legal system, Hart substitutes an entirely different set of conditions.</p><p>In my opinion, the real heart and soul of the foundation to Hart‚Äôs notion of a legal system rests upon how we understand and define the rule of recognition in relation to the beliefs and practices of the officials. All the dirty work and heavy lifting happens at that crux; it is what so distinctly sets his theory apart from the classical legal positivists; and his theory lives or dies by the viability of the concept of the rule of recognition. That is the essence of the replacement occurring.</p><p>3. According to Hart‚Äôs analysis, why is a primitive society, in which most people accept customary rules as standards of behavior and fulfill the duties distributed by the rules, a &quot;pre-legal&quot; system rather than a genuine legal system?</p><p>Pre-legal systems are not genuine because they lack secondary ‚Äúpower-conferring‚Äù rules, even if they possess primary ‚Äúduty imposing‚Äù rules, and thus they lack the necessary union between primary and secondary rules which Hart requires for genuine legal systems. Most importantly, pre-legal systems lack a fully expressed rule of recognition and the corresponding officials who practice and accept it. These pre-legal societies cannot answer the question: ‚ÄúHow do you go about figuring out whether or not a rule is valid or not?‚Äù Genuine legal systems, by definition, can answer that question.</p><p>Only (1) when the rules that are recognized as legally valid by the officials are genuinely complied with by everyone in the society, and (2) when the complex rule of recognition (which expresses of all secondary rules) is accepted and practiced by legal officials, does a genuine legal system exist. These conditions are not satisfied by pre-legal systems, and thus these primitive societies don‚Äôt have genuine legal systems, according to Hart.</p><p>4. Briefly explain what Hart means by a &quot;rule of recognition&quot; and the sense in which it is an &quot;ultimate&quot; rule of a legal system. How can we tell if a rule of recognition exists?</p><p>The rule of recognition is a secondary rule which is foundational to a genuine legal system, as it gives some set of officials the power to decide what are valid legal rules. The rule of recognition contains a certain hierarchal set of criteria which outline the validity of laws. When the rule of recognition is practiced and accepted by officials (which is the only time there is a rule of recognition), any rule which satisfies the criteria contained in the rule of recognition is a valid law in the legal system. The rule of recognition is supposed to diffuse defects of uncertainty concerning validity of law to some significant extent, but in practice, it doesn‚Äôt completely resolve all uncertainty.</p><p>The other secondary rules can be expressed by or compacted into the rule of recognition. The rule of change is connected to the rule of recognition because if you give a group of officials power to change primary laws, then you have to recognize that these legislators are a source of legal validity. If they follow the right procedure, then they‚Äôve created new or different rules of our legal system. Like the rules of change, people with the authority to adjudicate law are also recognized as a valid source of law, and hence rules of adjudication could just be seen as a complex expression of the rule of recognition. For example, when a judge issues a decision resolving a dispute, that interpretation is a valid law (or modification of law, etc.).</p><p>The rule of recognition is ultimate in the sense that there is nothing behind it which validates it, at least on Hart‚Äôs view (he is wrong though!). Every other rule can trace their validity to the rule of recognition. We might ask why X is a valid rule, and point to Y, and then we might ask why Y is valid, and so on. The rule of recognition is the stopping point (so we don‚Äôt hit a regress). The rule of recognition sits at the foundation of legal validity. Apparently, we can‚Äôt effectively ask and answer the question, ‚Äúwhat makes the rule of recognition legally valid?‚Äù.</p><p>There are two perspectives one may take to examine the rule of recognition. One perspective is external, descriptive, and concerned with objective observation of practices of officials, and the other is internal, subjective, and reflective (from the view of the officials). These dual perspectives are significant to the rule of recognition‚Äôs existence. If officials don‚Äôt accept (from an internal perspective) or aren‚Äôt engaged in the practice of the rule of recognition (from an external perspective), then it doesn‚Äôt exist.</p><p>5. Hart argues that a legal system provides at least three major benefits as compared to a pre-legal primitive community. Briefly describe the three ways in which a legal system is clearly better than a pre-legal system.</p><p>Pre-legal societies have (at least) three critical defects which prevent them from having genuine legal systems, and secondary rule (which pre-legal societies lack, but are found in genuine legal systems), are the solution to those defects.</p><p>The first defect is that pre-legal societies are bound to be uncertain about primary rules. People may not know what the primary are or what the rules mean. The secondary rule of recognition corrects this defect. The rule of recognition is a secondary rule which is foundational to a genuine legal system, as it gives some set of officials the power to decide what are valid legal rules. The rule of recognition contains a certain hierarchal set of criteria which outline the validity of laws. When the rule of recognition is practiced and accepted by officials (which is the only time there is a rule of recognition), any rule which satisfies the criteria contained in the rule of recognition is a valid law in the legal system. The rule of recognition is supposed to diffuse defects of uncertainty concerning validity of law to some significant extent, but in practice, it doesn‚Äôt completely resolve all uncertainty. Genuine legal systems, with the rule of recognition, do seem at least better (to some extent) than pre-legal systems with respect to the problem of uncertainty.</p><p>The second defect is that pre-legal societies are static. There aren‚Äôt mechanisms for changing laws. These mechanisms are necessary, on Hart‚Äôs view, to have a genuine legal system. The secondary rules of change correct this defect by giving some group of officials the power to change the duty imposing rules. We should note that this rule of change is connected to the rule of recognition because if you give a group of officials power to change primary laws, then you have to recognize that these legislators are a source of legal validity. If they follow the right procedure, then they‚Äôve created new or different rules of our legal system.</p><p>The third defect of pre-legal societies is decentralized enforcement, as they lack effective, efficient, and consistent interpretation of laws. The secondary rules of adjudication correct this defect by granting judges the power to adjudicate or settle disagreements or disputes over laws. Like the rules of change, the people with this authority to adjudicate are recognized as a valid source of law, and hence it could just be seen as a complex expression of the rule of recognition. When a judge issues a decision resolving a dispute, that interpretation is a valid law (or modification of law, etc.).</p><p>Thus, in a sense, these defects which prevent pre-legal societies from having genuine legal systems are corrected by the use of a complex rule of recognition (which expresses all the secondary rules). Ultimately, pre-legal systems lack a fully expressed rule of recognition. These societies cannot answer the question: ‚ÄúHow do you go about figuring out whether or not a rule is valid or not?‚Äù The inability to answer that question is the critical flaw of pre-legal societies, and the solution to that flaw, which is part of definition of genuine legal systems, is the reason why genuine legal systems might be seen as better than pre-legal systems.</p><p>6. Hart points out that, although a rule of recognition specifies a supreme criterion of legal validity, this does not imply that a sovereign exists at the foundation of the legal system. Briefly explain how there can be a supreme criterion of valid law without there being any sovereign. Illustrate your explanation by giving an example of a legal system that has no sovereign.</p><p>Hart‚Äôs rule of recognition can be the practice (external) and normative beliefs/motivations (internal) of a complex government that does not fit Hart‚Äôs narrow definition of sovereign (he‚Äôs addressing Austinian-like models which have simple sovereigns). Hence, there can be a rule of recognition, (supposedly) the source of this supreme criterion of valid, without a sovereign (as defined by Hart).</p><p>Hart believes we can‚Äôt always find a sovereign in some genuine legal systems. Take our written constitution - there are parts that are exempt from the article 5 amendment formula ‚Äì e.g. we can‚Äôt amend that a state gives up its two senators unless by the consent of that state. Imagine an unamendable constitution; since the constitution legally limits all other people‚Äôs powers, then there is no one or entity with unlimited power. We have a supreme criterion of valid law, but no sovereign (on Hart‚Äôs definition) in this example.</p><p>We might argue that whoever wrote the constitution and validated it would be the sovereign, and/or we might argue that this is just a case of popular sovereignty. Hart doesn‚Äôt buy that line of reasoning. Hart wants to draw a sharp line between popular sovereignty and a real, unlimited sovereign as found in the Simple Imperative model. To be honest, I really don‚Äôt see why he should be allowed to make that move. So, my explanation is that Hart has stated this distinction as a brute fact.</p><p>He‚Äôs right that we can‚Äôt always find a simple sovereign, e.g. a dictator or a single assembly, in all genuine legal systems. At first, this does seem to be a reasonable criticism of the simple imperative model. However, even this may not be true. For example, maybe there is a specific group of individuals that, if they came together, could decide to change the constitution (e.g. get rid of the 1st amendment). There seems to be a concentration of power in these people that might seem to look like Austinian sovereignty, even though there are intermediate steps.</p><p>Ultimately, sovereignty may just be more complex than Hart is willing to accept. It is far from obvious that the criterion of validity of law can really be distilled from all reasonable definitions of sovereignty.</p><p>7. Explain why a particular rule that is not followed by anyone can nevertheless be a valid law according to Hart‚Äôs theory.</p><p>A valid law comes from a genuine legal system. A genuine legal system can validate many laws. As long as this set of laws is generally followed, even if a particular law isn‚Äôt generally followed, then the first minimal necessary and sufficient condition will be met, so the unfollowed law remains valid.</p><p>There are two ways for a rule to not be followed. One, it isn‚Äôt a rule, and it is merely a law that is obeyed out of habit by the general population. A rule then isn‚Äôt being a followed at all, but it is still a valid law. This meets the first and second conditions.</p><p>The second way for a rule to not be followed is for</p><p>Valid laws only come from genuine legal systems. By Hart‚Äôs definition of a legal system (necessary and sufficient requirements), the rules generally must be followed. Is this the rules as a set, generally must be followed? Or, each law, individually, generally must be followed? I take it as the former.</p><p>I think this is tricky. The initial definition of ‚Äúrule‚Äù seems to be a modification of habits of behavior, where rules are a ‚Äúconvergence of behavior‚Äù + the internal perspective requirements and implications. I suppose the convergence part is really not all that important (except for the rule of recognition, in the case of officials). If that is the case, then it is at least possible for unfollowed primary rules, in particular, to actually be rules (as long as the internal components are maintained). Then it is just a matter of making sure that a rule is a valid law.</p><p>A valid is law is whatever the officials following the rule of recognition validate. Those governed by this law may take the law to be a rule, as in: they find it to be normative for them from critical reflection. And, perhaps all of these people will choose, nonetheless, to not follow the rule, despite believing they deserve criticism for doing so. Thus, it is actually rule which is not followed and also a valid law.</p><p>8. Hart argues that a legal system potentially involves major costs in addition to benefits as compared to a pre-legal primitive community. Indeed, he says that a legal system can exists in an unhealthy society which is &quot;deplorably sheeplike; the sheep might end in the slaughter-house.&quot; Explain why a legal system might impose serious costs which are not found in a pre-legal primitive society.</p><p>The ‚Äúcost‚Äù or risk that one runs from stepping up from pre-legal system to a genuine legal system is that officials can have legal power to oppress the population in cases where pre-legal systems relying upon primary rules alone would not. Primary rules in pre-legal system often seem to require the general support of population who follows these primary rules. This need not be case in a genuine legal system.</p><p>Maybe Nazi Germany is an example of genuine legal system wherein officials were able to abuse their power and legally slaughter many people. Genuine legal systems aren‚Äôt necessarily healthy, and they don‚Äôt necessarily bring about morally good laws ‚Äì they simply have a specific kind of structure. That structure can incur certain costs or risks by generating morally repugnant laws which could be less likely to be present in a pre-legal system that might tie primary laws closer to moral norms and the support of the people (rather than the rule of recognition as the source of validity and the support of officials).</p><p>Laws can be obeyed out of fear, and laws won‚Äôt be rules for the general population. Sheep. It is possible for there to be a genuine legal system where the officials are all engaged in this social practice (as to how they identify what counts as a valid rule), and they make immoral laws, and the ordinary citizens might be ignorant of th the secondary rules (don‚Äôt now much about the legal structure), and they may only comply because they fear punishment (not because these laws are rules or reasons for their own actions), and so the masses of the citizens can be like sheep. They don‚Äôt know how it works, and they can just comply out of fear of punishment, and this is unhealthy. Yet, it is valid.</p><p>You can have valid governments and laws which are terrible governments by the standards of the general population.</p><p>9. For Hart, what are the minimum necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a genuine legal system?</p><p>A genuine legal system or law stems from the union of two kinds of rules ‚Äì primary, duty imposing rules and secondary, power-conferring rules. The minimum necessary and sufficient conditions are this union. When primary rules which are validated by the supreme criterion of a legal system (and generally followed? This is far from clear), and when the complex rule of recognition (which expresses of all secondary rules) is accepted and practiced by legal officials, then a genuine legal system exists.</p><p>This is tricky though, since in class, you did say that while these may be necessary, it isn‚Äôt clear that it is sufficient. There may be more required.</p><p>10. Hart argues that there are situations such as revolutions and foreign invasions in which the existence of a legal system is uncertain or dubious. Suppose a foreign invasion occurs and the leaders of the domestic government are driven into exile. Using Hart‚Äôs theory, explain why the existence of a legal system is unclear in this situation. How can we tell if a genuine legal system is restored?</p><p>The existence of genuine legal system seems far easier to establish in Hart‚Äôs theory than the creation or restoration of one. My honest answer: I don‚Äôt know how we can tell if there is a restoration of a genuine legal system on Hart‚Äôs theory. I‚Äôm not sure we can. Even if we assume the foreign invaders had the necessary primary and secondary laws, and the required officials, instated in the invaded territory, it is unclear to me that a genuine legal system has been restored.</p><p>The ultimate problem: you need laws to confer power to officials, but then you need officials to make laws. You can see how both co-exist (sort of). It makes sense to talk about how secondary laws specify the transfer of powers from one official to his replacement. You can see how officials make, modify, extinguish, and validate laws. You can but you can‚Äôt really see the system begins though. How do you move from pre-legal to legal (whether from primitive societies to civil, or in the case of restoring legal systems)?</p><p>We can say the foreign invaders are the officials, and the foreign laws are the new laws. Problematically, who or what made these invaders the officials? Nobody and nothing! You need secondary laws to do that. The old secondary laws and exiled officials didn‚Äôt allow for a legal, hostile takeover, presumably. Our intuition should be that only those secondary laws and officials could possibly validate or enable the restoration or wide transition of one domestic government into a foreign one.</p><p>We could argue that the laws of the foreign government are what support the transition to the newly formed foreign control over a land. This very much goes against my intuition, but I think it is the only move one can make. If this is true, it seems to me there are tertiary rules which talk about the validity of secondary rules in the cases of radical legal transitions, including the formation of new systems and the forced replacement of others.</p><p>Uncertainty is in this.</p><p>11. Suppose a revolutionary war occurs, for instance, America‚Äôs war of independence against Britain. Using Hart‚Äôs theory, explain why the existence of a legal system becomes uncertain during the period of revolutionary war. Once America achieved independence, how did the new legal system differ from the old one?</p><p>People might not be following the laws in general that are recognized by British Officials</p><p>Who are the real officials? The local American or the British?</p><p>If it is the American, how did it begin? How does one become and official without rules that confer that power to them, and how could there be those power conferring rules without the officials?</p><p>New legal system has different officials, a different rule of recognition, and a different supreme criterion (not the British parliament).</p><p>What if English and American officials had the same primary laws, and the people obeyed both coincidentally. Who are the officials? That‚Äôs what matters.</p><p>Can you establish the two minimum criteria? How do we get there?</p><p>12. In his Postscript, Hart tells us that his theory of law is a version of &quot;soft positivism.&quot; Briefly explain what he means by &quot;soft positivism&quot; and why he thinks it is consistent with his analysis of a legal system, in particular, his description of the benefits provided by a legal system as compared to a pre-legal primitive community.</p><p>Uncertainly doesn‚Äôt seem completely removed, but Hart seems okay with that.</p><p>13. In his Postscript, Hart says that he defends a &quot;practice theory of rules,&quot; which he says is &quot;a faithful account of conventional social rules.&quot; Using Coleman‚Äôs arguments in Lecture 7 of his text, briefly clarify the practice theory. In particular, clarify what the practice theory says about the reasons for action which are provided by conventional social rules.</p><p>When an official chooses what rule, they have a cooperate social endeavor or practice. Adherence to a rule of recognition that imposes a duty (the conventionality thesis). You want to make sure everyone is cooperating with each other, and you have to make sure you following precedent,</p><p>14. According to Hart‚Äôs theory, is the general point or purpose of the law to provide the best moral interpretation of the community‚Äôs understanding of justice and the legitimate use of state coercion? Explain Hart‚Äôs view of the functions of the law.</p><p>No. Law guide our conduct and offers the standards of criticism from the internal perspective of the officials.</p><p>Justice for Hedgehogs.</p><p>15. Clarify what Hart means by the &quot;minimum content of natural law.&quot; Since he admits that this minimum content is an element of &quot;common sense&quot; in the natural law theory, is he therefore admitting that he is not really a legal positivist because there is no logical separation between law and morals? Discuss.</p><p>Natural law helps humans survive. Nazi‚Äôs are legal systems. Morality is disconnected.</p></div>
