<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>It's always sad to see that Orwell and Huxley can both be at least half right at the same time. I tend to cover the Orwellian perspective the most, especially since I consider it the most coercive. But, that is not a complete story. Huxley's vision has enormous explanatory power as well. Huxley was right about the way in which humanity continues to trend towards pleasuring ourselves. His understanding of the systematic effect of the mix between technology and egoism on the world at large was prophetic, even if not always accurate.</p><p>As someone who has emerged from severe depression (or still is emerging), I can completely see the moral and prudential viability of taking <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Cypher's%2520Choice.html">Cypher's Choice</a> in The Matrix. Embedding ourselves in experience machines is arguably what we are all trying to do in the first place. However sad it may be, it appears to be a morally permissible (if not obligatory) option. Arguing against experience machines, in my experience, rests upon unjustified intuitions and assumptions. I've yet to see an argument that remotely comes close to diffusing the virtual bomb against reality.</p><p>Seriously, what is the purpose of life? To be happy. Right? We're going to beg the question here; it's innately axiomatic (I am fully aware of the is/ought distinction, and I still take this argument to be valid). Any sufficiently advanced species in the universe has likely been egoistically motivated through evolutionary processes. I don't mean this as a natural fallacy either. Surely we can be justified, insofar as metamodern justification is even plausible, in at least many cases of building things around us that augment and replace reality. I think you already accept this to some degree, you just don't realize the implications of taking your principles to the Nth degree. We maximize our utility through tools, avoid danger and pain, and pay the lowest cost for the highest systematic pleasure returns. Virtual reality seems like an obvious space in which to live the kinds of lives we want to live without paying the physical costs (many of which are impossible to pay) of making such a world &quot;real&quot; in the flesh. </p><p>It is far more price-efficient to derive meaning and satisfaction from virtual reality than reality itself. Our species is evolving to short circuit the evolutionary drive for survival and pleasure through standard, brutal reality. Instead of accepting and living in bare reality, we use drugs, tell stories, play games, live in virtual worlds, etc. to replace our usual lives. We've been making experience machines for ourselves for a very long time. Psychotropic drug use is older than written history, even the lower animals play games (and use drugs!), stories might just definitionally be the human experience, and religion is also an experience machine (an opiate of the masses). As we evolve and innovate, we discover more effective and efficient pleasure chemical inducing practices. </p><p>Experience machines are the potent means to our ends as a species. The grass can always be greener, that is the essence of hope. Hope is the belief that this is not all there is, that we can be happier, more purpose-filled, meaningful, content, joyful, and satisfied. Experience machines provide the firmament for worlds with greener grasses. This is what enlightenment is actually pursuing. Use tools to make life easier and avoid the hardships of nature. Take your Soma because you seek bliss. Immerse yourself in virtual worlds, in soap operas, in games, in religion to be happier. Perhaps it will only be a matter of time until we have the technology to rig our brains with neural laces or a brain fungus to permanently exist in a state of sublime orgasm.</p><p>I've given you the theory, now let us inspect the application we see today. Video games are but one profound example of this systemic contemporary Brave New Experience Machine which devours our first-world youth. Now, growing up, I heard plenty of bullshit about the futility and uselessness of video games. The truth is more complex than that.</p><p>I think video games are wonderful tools. Video games are microcosms. They even teach us about the real world, give us narratives and other worlds to explore,  provide us characters and communities of RL people with which to empathize and connect to, and even improve dexterity, problem-solving, and technical skills. Hell, I'm literally trying to play life like a video game, that's how convinced I am by the positive influence that video games can have on our lives. I was a proponent of video games long before they were completely mainstream,<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> but even I'm willing to point out their flaws.</p><p>Like any drug or skinner-box activity, addiction is a fundamental problem. If pleasure is fundamentally what drives us, the shortcut that video games provide to pumping the pleasure center of our brain can easily warp our behavior so as to provide us short-sighted, instant-gratification driven, poor executive functioning. It's hard to be wise when you can merely push buttons for pleasure. It's hard to engage in longer-term thinking. However, I want to point out that while video game addiction is quite real (you're listening to a survivor), more and more I see video game dependence as not being negative (standardly addictive) because it is literally the best utility-generating option for too many people.</p><p>Many rational utility seekers (to various degrees) are withdrawing from society to play video games. They do not participate in our economy. It is sad that the best method for them to maximize their utility is through our poor experience machine video game bubbles. I'm not here to victim blame though (I think it would border on fundamental attribution error). There is something logical about their approach, a utility-maximization we should appreciate.</p><p>The fact is that work is generally a means to an end in our world. Few have jobs they enjoy or find intrinsic value in. Thus, for most folks, the end is all that matters. The means is variable. If being unemployed can achieve acceptable ends, then why work? Again. I'm not claiming they are &quot;lazy bums&quot; or some other conservative lunacy (I say it again to you conservatives: please KYS; we'd all be much happier without you). Not working means you have more time to enjoy the luxuries you do have. I see these brave souls as sucking the marrow out of life, of making do with their predicament. These are utility-maximizing rational tradeoffs.</p><p>No doubt, the long-term consequences for their lives and our human capital will be severe. I think this is the hikikomori hope though, however bleak it may be. The game of life is rigged against us, and the end appears to be coming. There is a threshold at which it is hard to justify empathizing with your future self or humanity. Assuming we will fail as a species, I guess I'm saying: we need radically better experience machines. I'm coming out as a transhumanist in prescription, but not as predictive description for the masses.</p><p>Huxley, yet again, was a visionary.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> I don't mean this as some useless hipsterism or appeal to authority.</sub></p></div>
