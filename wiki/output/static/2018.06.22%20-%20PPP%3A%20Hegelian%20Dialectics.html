(PhG ¬ß79) 
</p></blockquote><p>The Stanford piece is excellent, as usual.</p><p>I want to be ridiculously specific, and I think I need to understand how Turing machines logically relate to the Hegelian Dialectic. Dialectic may itself be a problem, and that's why it expands into Triad, Triplicity, or perhaps even Trialectic. But, why do we stop there? One answer might be the collapse of second-order logic into itself. What about metalogic can we cleanly relate to this?</p><p>If phenomenology is autistically attending to our perceptions in search of the model, then structuralist approaches might be imposing our schizophrenic model onto our perceptions. You need both, of course, to have have knowledge. All uncertain, non-apodictic, must-be-justified by something outside it, externalist, non-faith-based, empirical knowledge is going to rely upon that kind of computation (and perhaps all knowledge is the result of this process if we take Hegel's Dialectic seriously enough).</p><p>Again, I suggest that there is faith deep down in Hegel's rabbithole. He cannot show how the triadic-Dialectic method applies to the notion of telos, of purpose! This is a huge fucking deal to me, since I take <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> just to be that thing. To be unable to explain your way from and to that thing is to not have a theory of philosophy at all. </p><p>Being vs. Meaning (The Good) seem to be the fundamental dialectic to me. It's not Being vs Non-Being, unless we are talking about the fundamental ontological dialectic. The fundamental epistemic dialectic is Meaning vs. Non-Meaning. No, the real struggle is always Being vs. Meaning, the epistemic vs the ontic, the perceived vs. the real. They form something special against each other.</p><p>One thing I truly do not understand is time's role. Dialectical sublation of Being and Non-Being just is the Becoming. Becoming contains and preserves what it has sublated. Processes require time. Time is always a fundamental part of the computation. I do not understand what timeless computation means, but in a sense, that's just part of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> to me. </p><p>One nice thing about binary formats is that they can be used to represent data of trinary formats, etc. The limits to infinity can probably handled. Again, I cannot begin to conceive of what infinite computation looks like, for all I know, it is just a contradiction I take on faith. The 0's and 1's don't do anything by themselves. The is and is-nots, there is a negative space created, it allows for algorithmic sculptures to arise from the flat hierarchyless nothing abyss. </p><p>To my eyes, we do not give a &quot;Being&quot; to Non-Being, but rather a meaning to non-being. The meaning of non-being then does appear to have a being. They aren't opposed to each other though. What is the being of meaning and non-meaning though? It seems like either &quot;Being&quot; or &quot;Meaning&quot; must be the master in the dialectic, but the Bayesian is looking to make them equal. That is the pursuit of philosophy, of knowledge itself? </p><p>It seems to me that there can be no meaning without being and no being without meaning. </p><ul><li>There is the FO binary format: [meaning] vs [non-meaning]</li><li>There is the FO binary format: [being] vs [non-being] </li><li>?There is the SO sublator format of:<ul><li>[meaning of meaning] vs [non-meaning of meaning]</li><li>[meaning of non-meaning] vs [non-meaning of non-meaning] </li><li>[meaning of being] vs [non-meaning of being]</li><li>[meaning of non-being] vs [non-meaning of non-being]</li><li>[being of being] vs [non-being of being]</li><li>[being of non-being] vs [non-being of non-being]</li><li>...</li></ul></li><li>?There is SO sublator format of:<ul><li>being and non-being of becoming<ul><li>Computed being</li></ul></li><li>meaning and non-meaning of thinking<ul><li>Computed meaning</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The Triad sublator of FO and SO:<ul><li>The Unity of the Becoming of Thinking.</li><li>The Disunity of the Unbecoming of Thinking.</li><li>The Unity of the Becoming of Non-Thinking.</li><li>The Disunity of Unbecoming of Non-Thinking.</li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/turing-machine/one.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/turing-machine/one.html</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?InfiniteStateMachine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://wiki.c2.com/?InfiniteStateMachine</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_opposition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_opposition</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism</a></li></ul><p>???

One nice aspect of the physical theory of relativity for me is that I still believe in objective reality after it. There is a truth to the matter still, and I'm not bothered by contextualist and particularist worries. Relativity universalizes non-relatively, or so it seems.</p><p>Alright, so a 3 symbol turing machine is fascinating: </p><p>Blank is &quot;There being a non-meaning&quot; and Non-blank &quot;there being a meaning&quot;</p><p>There seem to be two kinds of meaning, 1 and 0. </p><p>The meaning of the computation is an emergence from the turing machine.</p><p>Time to process is another player in this game, and it's a matter of faith. Perhaps it is just the inductive step.</p><p>It seems to me the the dialectical move of positing a limit and then something outside that limit should be an inductive step for us. When I get caught with my pants down in a proof, proof by contradiction is inevitably my only way out 99% of the time. Is the dialectical inferentialism captured by any logical operation? I don't know how it works, but it seems like it's trying to swallow FO, SO, and metalogic all into one thing. Formalization of Hegel's logic may appear impossible, but what can do we to make sense of it before we say, and &quot;here&quot; is the impossible step?</p><p>In a sense, I suggest that the speculative realist, the dialetheist, the paraconsistent or intuitionist logician, they are all trying to contain the absurdity into a box. They aim to make as much of the world as real as possible while finding a Transcendental Pandoran Container. </p><p>I don't know what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is.</p><p>Why can't the skeptic say there's no necessity in stopping the infinigress? If there is necessity, we get Hegel's structure, but we may eventually arrive at the infinigress anyways, where thereby there is no need to stop the infinigress (I suggest as both beginning and end, inside and out).</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youtu.be/HIjmR1dpW8E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/HIjmR1dpW8E</a></li></ul><p>This appears to the commentary I've been looking for. It's too much to write about! I'm barely able to take it all in. 54.4.</p></div>
