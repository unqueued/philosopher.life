<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Installed Ad Nauseum for the umpteenth time. Let's see if it has the functionality of actual uBlock Origin this time. I fear it doesn't. That's okay. I very much like what it stands for.</p><p>I couldn't get my VPN connections working. Digging, I realized I fucked up by not restarting immediately after a kernel update. I should have known better, but I didn't do it. My kernel modules were messed up. Also, I had some VM problems. I fixed it, but I literally don't know how or why. I cleaned out my old kernels, ran an update and restarted, and it magically worked. </p><p>Oh, so yeah, I now have at least one set of my VPNs up.</p><p>Trying out Resilio Sync Pro. It's meh thus far.</p><p>Also, I just realized I made about 2 grand this year from cryptocurrency investing. I should have just gone with my gut on zCash. I can see I was right about about it from before it was even released. I should have poured a ton into it.</p><p>FUUUUUUU...HTPC static-shocked me again. Fans are whirring for no reason. Temps look good. Something is still wrong. I think I've got a short somewhere. I'm grounding myself against the mini-fridge now before I touch it. Seems safe so far. Maybe it's just me.</p><p>I had to enable uBlock Origin again. Ad Nauseum can't be used alone.</p><p>aMule setup. Sharing snaphots. Also Soulseek.</p><p>Setup DNScrypt. Seems to have a lot of dirty cache.</p><p>Ricochet setup, again.</p><p>Perfect Dark attempted in Wine. It's been a while! =) No Go, btw. I could VM it, but I don't think it is worth the work. I've run across a couple Japanese undergrounds, but I can't read Japanese (which hurts). This was an interesting tool, but meh.</p><p>EiskaltDC++ took fucking forever to compile. Went with another version. Need to set that badboy up.</p><p>My daughter has been having a rough time with Resilio on massive amounts of files. It eats up 6-8GB of RAM. That really is absurd. We're going to try a more standard sync procedure at this point.</p><p>IPFS setup. I'm considering putting the sit on it as well, but eh. For now, I'll be fine just keeping the snapshots.</p></div>
