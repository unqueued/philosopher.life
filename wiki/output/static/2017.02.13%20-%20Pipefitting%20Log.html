<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today I took a test on power tools. I tend to read ahead in the book. My teacher gives us a study guide, and I carefully study those particular sections. I make A's on tests, but sometimes I miss a couple questions. My teacher seems unworried by it. But, this is a culture which is fine with C's and B's. I will force myself to retake the actual pipefitting exams until I can get them all right though.</p><p>Since I took my test early in the day (Mondays, from what I've gathered, are days where people sit on their asses and pretend to study while the teacher screws around), I was given something cool to do. I had asked about pipebending (since my brother talks about it often). Apparently, it is very uncommon for a pipefitter to do, but it does happen. So, I wanted to learn. We happened to have a giant programmable pipebending machine. We dusted it off (cleaned it and the area around it too) and started using it. I got to work with black iron pipe for the first time, and I also got to use the giant pipe cutting machine for the first time (super easy to use). Apparently, we are making 90s for the welding shop to use that day. /shrug, cool with me.</p><p>The pipebending machine hasn't been used for a year. My teacher had to bring out his calibration notes and the manual for the machine. We kept being 13 degrees off on our 90-degree bends. We cheated to make the bends (try squaring it by hand until we got it &quot;good enough&quot;). This didn't satisfy any of us. My teacher couldn't figure it out, so he let Keith and I figure it out. We watched the manufacturer's video, read the documentation, and messed around with it. It started working correctly for us, thankfully. I hate to say that I don't fully understand why we got it working when my teacher couldn't. It was kind of baffling. My suggestion, that we weren't initially mounting the pipe at a perpendicular angle (which is necessary) was turned down. I am quietly suspicious that I'm still right about this, but I can't say that I know that I'm right. I could easily be wrong.</p><p>I've been studying CAD prints. There is a lot of information on them and tons of objects I've never seen before. It looks doable though. From what I understand, the foreman (and/or pipefitter) interprets the prints and gives instructions or simplified isometric drawings to his underlings. A student who has been in the field (although, I suspect he doesn't have the drive or wisdom to know how to maximize his upward mobility) says that I wouldn't see those plans for at least 3 years as an apprentice. My teacher says a good journeyman or foreman would take the time to show me (and that I should definitely seek to understand them). I can only assume I will need to be excellent at it. My teacher walked me through a bunch of problems/questions I had about the prints he lent me.</p></div>
