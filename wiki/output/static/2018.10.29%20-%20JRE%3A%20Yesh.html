MON 5:59 PM
Was weird being forman.  Really wanted to just tell one of my guys to let me do his stuff cause he was so slow, but had to spend a lot of time tracking down materials
MON 9:02 PM
=)
MON 9:02 PM
Few more years of it under your belt, and it will feel normal.
MON 9:02 PM
You ok?
MON 9:03 PM
Yeah, I'm good. lol. =)
MON 9:04 PM
Saw your post from our last phone call
MON 9:04 PM
Ah, yes. That questions makes sense now.
MON 9:05 PM
If you think something is wrong, then that is good cause for me to think there is something wrong.
MON 9:05 PM
Just sounded stressed
MON 9:06 PM
That I am. But, my rash is dissipating. I think it is getting under control.
MON 9:06 PM
Off the record
MON 9:09 PM
Stress is the enemy of our success
MON 9:09 PM
hehe
MON 9:09 PM
It definitely can be.
MON 9:10 PM
How often does he get paid?
MON 9:10 PM
I have no idea.
MON 9:10 PM
He cancelled on me today :disappointed_relieved:
MON 9:10 PM
=(
MON 9:10 PM
He hasn't responded to me either.
MON 9:11 PM
I'm not sure what's up.
MON 9:11 PM
Got ghosted by his boo
MON 9:11 PM
Oh
MON 9:11 PM
Shit. That sucks.
MON 9:11 PM
He must be drunk out of his mind.
MON 9:11 PM
Said he really wanted to get wasted, but was gonna cook a meal for his roommate instead
MON 9:12 PM
So hopefully not
MON 9:12 PM
I'm surprised he didn't say anything to me about it. Was waiting on him to talk to me after the date.
MON 9:13 PM
Yep yep
MON 9:13 PM
Hard to know if it was my brother or not on the phone, I'm not great at telling
MON 9:14 PM
lol
MON 9:14 PM
That's such an interesting way to phrase it.
MON 9:14 PM
Lil word salad, but not full blown, overall good convo really
MON 9:14 PM
He was supposed to send me pics of his hair care products and routine... his hair is crazy nice for our family
MON 9:15 PM
I told [[AIR]] long ago that sober [[AIR]] is a beautiful person, complex and lights up the room.  I also told him drunk [[AIR]] is kind of a dick and I don't really want to hang with him
MON 9:17 PM
Obviously, when he overmedicates, he is still my brother, just dont have to like him then
MON 9:17 PM
Love != Like
MON 9:18 PM
as you point out
MON 9:18 PM
Shit. I'm still shocked by it.
MON 9:18 PM
We were talking about Jay basically every day last week. I don't understand why full-blown ghosting.
MON 9:18 PM
Shocked by how nice that mofo's hair is?
MON 9:19 PM
His hair is nice.
MON 9:19 PM
Didn't see it with product, but he brought the Bear necessities.
MON 9:19 PM
Bam, another way to find your identity... oldest brother of three, middle bro electrician, younger bro hair most excellent
MON 9:20 PM
They are closin in
MON 9:20 PM
lol =)
MON 9:20 PM
Got frozen gnocchi bag from trader joes the other day.  Has sauce and cheese frozen with it.  Eatin it now. Shit is delicious
MON 9:22 PM
Doesnt touch the stuff [[AIR]] made in new orleans
MON 9:22 PM
That sounds good.
MON 9:22 PM
Yesh
MON 9:22 PM
lol
MON 9:22 PM
Gabagool
MON 9:23 PM
What did we say about yep...
MON 9:23 PM
Lol
MON 9:23 PM
Reb was just watching casino night
MON 9:23 PM
Surprised i haven't ruined the show for her
MON 9:23 PM
It's so rewatchable, I think it might be impossible to ruin that show.
MON 9:24 PM
Gotta jump on dishes and fold some laundry
MON 9:24 PM
k
MON 9:24 PM
Lets get some wow talk in tomorrow
MON 9:24 PM
Also, love watching that with [[1uxb0x]]. He literally flees the room during cringe scenes.
MON 9:24 PM
Same with a number of shows.
MON 9:25 PM
Eager to hear about the efficacy of that particular drug and its tolerance curve
MON 9:25 PM
Lol
MON 9:25 PM
Ah
MON 9:25 PM
Scotts tots is the fuckin worst
MON 9:25 PM
I love/hate it so hard
MON 9:25 PM
It's fun to see him understand what's actually happening socially in the show and realizing in horror what it means.
MON 9:25 PM
I'm having a hard time coming up with anything as horrifying as Scotts Tots
MON 9:25 PM
It might be on it's own level.
MON 9:26 PM
Anyways, get some sleep. Hope your foreman work kicks butt.
MON 9:26 PM
Yeah, i have watched almost the entire show 4 times through, and watched many episodes above and beyond that, but i have only gotten thru scotts tots start to finish 2 times
MON 9:27 PM
Love yah, sleep well, don't let the wolf try to wrestle you too much</code></pre></div>
