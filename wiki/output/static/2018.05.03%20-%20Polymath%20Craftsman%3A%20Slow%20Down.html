<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Arrived earlier than the boss, which is all that matters (on time, of course). He didn't seem very psyched. I think he actually kind of hates his job, even though that is lal he does with his life. That's pretty sad, and it is obvious to me that wealth enables people to actually live their lives rather than slave away for someone else, enabling them to live their lives. </p><p>We dug out the last ditch, the nasty one, in no time. Colton was surprised. But, I was resolved to just get it out of the way. We did the wire pulls and poured the concrete for the remaining 2 poles. We filled in the trenches, and we got it hooked into the box. </p><p>I'm on my first break at 10, and I'm thinking we are almost done with what we set out to accomplish today. I believe we will get everything set and cleaned up on this row of houses. The goal is to make it look perfect, like we were never there, to be satisfied with it entirely, and hopefully, if we are lucky to just go home early. I'm hoping that since it is Thursday, the last day of this work week, that we will able to nudge Colton into letting us leave early. He does have to travel all the way back to Knoxville. </p><p>Hmm...I somehow lost some of my work here. I do not understand what has happened. Perhaps I'm not booting down correctly. In any case, It doesn't matter though.</p><p>We spent hours doing bullshit work. Colton could have let us out by 1pm, but he tried to drag out the day. I do not understand this. It's dumb. I am now in full doubt that he would allow us to leave early in the last week. I will be taking it slow from now on. He is a &quot;suck ass&quot; who is attempting to climb from the near bottom of the ladder in his contractor company. This is dumb. I guess it is better than working though. I can see that he doesn't really mean to let us go early when we don't have work to do. I'm glad I was able to test him.
