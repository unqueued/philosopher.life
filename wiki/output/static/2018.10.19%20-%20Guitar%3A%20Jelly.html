<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="title.Title.html">title.Title</a> per request of my daughter. </p><p>I'm still polishing my favorite Celtic pieces and shotgunning for more candidates. There are some small parts of these songs which I can play now better than I ever have, imho (or I can't trust my memory?). </p><p>We jellied today. My son and I played <em>Minuet in G</em>. We have the first page at a low speed, and we played it endlessly to the point that I can think outside the music as I'm playing it (that's what's supposed to happen!). I can feel the practice he has put into his chords. I'm glad. I continue to have to get him to focus on practicing. If I don't hear him playing, he's screwing up. I tried to give him something to imitate as I practice (though, admittedly, I'm not actually going 100%). My son's fingers are still feeling the heat, but I hope with more practice it will subside for him. I understand that being autistic can make it very difficult to dim or turn off those sensations. I'm proud of him for trying and pushing through the annoyance and pain.</p><p>My daughter is off in her own world, but she's clearly making progress. Jumping into a canonical Banjo piece in your first week playing a Banjo is no small task. A month of practice, and she may have that song down. I continue to walk through small tips and the notion of practicing on purpose with them. </p><p>We took an hour today. I relinquished a 30 minute chunk of CS for it.</p><p>Since my daughter has a page, I need to join her. I've never played the guitar's half of this song, and I think I need photo copies (since we both rely upon seeing the music [though, she has memorized quite a bit]).</p></div>
