I had no idea what to expect, lol.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#181223%20%E2%80%93%20Awareness%20Log%3A%20Feedback%20Loop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#181223%20%E2%80%93%20Awareness%20Log%3A%20Feedback%20Loop</a></li></ul><p>This is a heavy log. You are tackling crazy hard problems in here.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>&quot;The key is to be able to step outside of that feedback loop,&quot;
</p></blockquote><p>I sometimes think those thought loops are part of the process of what makes me good at analyzing things. They can be detrimental though. Breaking out of thought loops is hard work. This is part of why I'm trying to learn how to meditate. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I don't know if writing them down will get them out of my head, so to speak, or if it will be like pouring fuel on the fire and giving them legitimacy.
</p></blockquote><p>I have found that some get worse and some get better with writing. I don't know the rule.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I feel afraid of all the uncertainty that comes with being human and having the freedom to make choices and weaving my life in with other humans who also have that freedom and those choices.
</p></blockquote><p>I have had professors who didn't believe they phenomenologically experienced real freedom more than a handful of times in their lifetime. I'm curious to know if you have incompatibilist tendencies.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I don't know how to listen and believe or trust myself because what if it's all just hormonal emotions and doesn't mean anything???? What if it's just the oxytocin bond ‚Äì and what if the limitations of my brain make it so I can't imagine anything different than my current situation and make it so I don't want to give up my comfort and I confabulate that into being &quot;the voice of my inner self&quot;?
</p></blockquote><p>Oh. Now that is a fantastically difficult problem. Absurdly hard. I have no acceptable answer for myself. I think shooting to become a compatibilist might help you. I tried and failed, but some people seem to be able to make the jump. Start looking around. I don't know how deep down that rabbithole you want to go. I can't speak to how the frontal lobes play into this one for you.</p><p>I take my freedom on faith at this point. It's paranoic and sometimes I don't want to feel free either. </p><p>Let me say: this was the redflag for me. It's one of the reasons I left academic philosophy. I am not sure if I am of use to you or not. Unfortunately, my style of philosophy remains deconstructive and not nearly constructive enough in this area. I am working hard. </p><p>One thing is clear: you care about your life much further down than most people I know. These are not questions they ask themselves (which is insane to me). I think it's important to remind you that sensitivity is linked to intelligence. You are going to have strong emotional reactions that others aren't going to have because they simply weren't aware of the problem in the first place. It's easy to hold yourself to too high a standard here, imho. <code>/hug</code></p><p>This awareness log is amazing. You post so few of them! Ofc, Mazeway and Awareness logs are my favorite. I can't help it.</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#%F0%9F%93%9D%20coding%20logs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#%F0%9F%93%9D%20coding%20logs</a></li></ul><p>I'm hoping to eventually see your take on various dark patterns.</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://sphygm.us/#190115%20%E2%80%93%20the%20archive%3A%20digging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sphygm.us/#190115%20%E2%80%93%20the%20archive%3A%20digging</a></li></ul><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>the religion screams out and burns me. Those do not feel like my words; I can only see the fervency as a coping mechanism.
</p></blockquote><p>Do you still believe in metaphysics? I am interested to know if you still consider yourself religious or spiritual. It may be part of the freewill wrestling you have, on top of trying to give an account of your <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a>.

For as far as the eye can see, there is nothing but sky and dirt. The cracks at our feet spread in all directions, and the howling wind lifts loose dirt up and flings it across the landscape. Suddenly, we stumble onto what seems to be a path. All the cracks have been filled, and the dirt is tamped down firm. Each side has been carefully lined with stones. We walk along the trail for hours. Where does it go? Does it ever end? Finally, we see a speck in the distance. As we get close, it becomes a small hut made of stick, with the cracks filled with mud, and the roof of dry grass, woven together...
