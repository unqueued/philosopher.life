<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I arrived a bit early. Bull and Jaye showed up within about 10 minutes. I finished off my <em>Revisionist History</em> podcast before walking in.</p><p>Jaye had to put caps on our pipe, and I set up for the tie-in. We did the fitup for the short piece I had to cut yesterday for Room #2's return. He welded that as well. I ran around making sure it was ready. </p><p>My lovely wife was kind enough to fax and email my documents to the HR rep of Yates. I then had a flurry of e-mails, texts, and voice messages with my teacher and the HR rep. I kept losing signal, so I had to do it asynchronously with them. I sent a pic of my ID to the HR rep. I think we are in good shape. I believe I have this job.</p><p>We mounted the two L's pieces after the break. Bull did the dangerous part without a lift, harness, etc. That was some nasty work. I went top side, but Kevin had already lifted to go topside (Bull and Jaye were on the bottom). I had to scramble for a ladder, and by the time I got there, he was already mounting the first. It was off. I obviously did something wrong /nightmare. It's okay, I'm only human. Bull said nothing (which isn't necessarily a good thing), except that we'll loosen the bolts up top to force it into place and tack it. It's forcible (ugh, but I thought it had it!).</p><p>The hard piece with 45's fit like a fucking glove though. I got a high five for that from Jaye. </p><p>On the way back down, I didn't want to go in the lift, which was very poorly positioned. It required a small leap that I didn't want to take. I just used the ladder. I'm skeered. =)</p><p>I talked to my teacher at lunch. He said that SMS didn't treat me write on the pay cut without telling me beforehand and that I should say that (in addition to the fact that the job is closer to home and I get paid more). The job doesn't start this coming Monday, but the one after. That sucks. I'm still grateful.</p><p>After lunch, Jaye and I mounted the bottom half of Room #2. They went up with some work. The small piece I had to do solo up 12-15 feet in the air, which was nerve-wracking. The big piece we got up (with great effort, and then found the wall hole wasn't big enough for the flange. So, we took it down, got a sawzaw (sp?) and cut it larger. The big piece went up without a huge struggle on the second time. </p><p>Jaye, of course, likes to make fun of my safety concern, until he doesn't. Sometimes, he wholeheartedly agrees. I will take the teasing as a compliment, honestly. I know it won't make me popular, but that's fine. </p><p>Afterward, we went up top to measure the top half of Room #2. We did what we could. Jaye left at 3. Bull left at 3:15. He gave me the keys and told me to bring them tomorrow. I think this is a show of trust.</p><p>I did the math, cut the pipe, prepared ourselves for tomorrow, and cleaned up.</p><p>In the evening, I received word from Johanna that my tools arrived. Huzzah! The only problem now is getting them. I've already got a very full Saturday, and I have to squeeze it in. We have to buy a car, and I don't want to feel rushed. This kind of sucks. My wife has mapped out where we'll be visiting so we can go boom, boom, boom to find the car we want asap.</p></div>
