<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">About:</h2><p><em>I'm so proud of you that it makes me proud of me. I need you to know: whenever you believe I am disappointed with you, it is because I am disappointed in myself. I am never ashamed of you; I am ashamed of myself. My behaviors and beliefs are never, ever your fault. Whatever you do, don't waste your time forgiving or justifying me: instead, find happiness with or without me, whatever it takes. My goal is to chase your happiness, son, because I owe you that as your creator. You owe it to yourself to wisely pursue happiness because you are worth it.</em></p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>What was silent in the father speaks in the son, and often I found in the son the unveiled secret of the father.
</p></blockquote><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Our%2520Son%253A%2520The%2520Conqueror%2520of%2520Happiness.html">Our Son: The Conqueror of Happiness</a></li></ul><p>To the best of his abilities, my son empathizes with everyone, even when it requires sacrificing empathizing with himself. To my existential horror, sometimes empathizing with me requires not empathizing with himself. I must admit that his viciously<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> altruistic character is learned behavior. My son often doesn't empathize with himself. He objectifies himself, and that is no accident. It is the result of feeling:</p><ol><li>it necessary to compensate for being autistic, for both the genetically and memetically caused atypical neural activations in his rTPJ.</li><li>he hasn't earned the right to love himself, as if he deserves to hate himself. </li></ol><p>I am responsible for this. He learned it from me.</p><p>He was genetically predisposed, from my genes (and my wife's), very clearly. But, more tragically relevantly, I am memetically, environmentally, and parentally responsible for the fact that my son does not love himself. My son does not respect himself in a consistent manner, does not recognize his own dignity in a fitting way, and dehumanizes himself when he is saddest. </p><p>I am responsible for this. He learned it from me.</p><p>I do this to myself sometimes, so I'm not a good role model, but more damningly, it is my psychopathy<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button> that has damaged him. My son has seen the monster inside me moreso than any human alive. This innocent child who could not understand what torments and twists me was subject to it, unshielded. I have failed to respect my son's dignity time and time again. </p><p>I am responsible for this. He learned it from me.</p><p>Violence begets violence; abuse is cyclical; and, my son pays for my mistakes. I pass my demons on. My son has not appropriately loved himself because I failed to love him. I have been a terrible father.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> I cannot undo what I have done. I would end my life to undo his suffering without a second thought, but that does not restore my son. Therefore, I must give my living life to him, enslave myself to his happiness, as that is likely the best chance of restoring him. There is yet time to build towards his happiness.</p><p>My son didn't speak until he was 4, and it has been a torturous uphill battle to help him become functional. I am afraid for him; I'm afraid of what his life will be like. I desperately want him to have the tools to be self-sufficient, to avoid persecution, and to be happy on his own terms. He fills me with hope when I watch him make quantum leaps I did not realize he was capable of. He is clearly intelligent, even if unpredictably and perplexingly so. I should not underestimate my son, but I also should not apply too much pressure. It is a difficult balance to strike. It is not my goal to duplicate myself in my son, but I hope to give him what tools I have (and beyond) that suit him. Every day is uncharted territory with him, and we will seize that opportunity. Life gets better for my son; I have seen it. </p><hr><h2 class="">Principles:</h2><ul><li>I must help my son love himself. It is the only cure.</li><li>I must be a good rolemodel for him and empathize with him deeply. </li><li>I must give him hope, protect him, listen to him, and cultivate him. </li><li>I must help my son respect himself, to avoid being overly self-critical, to forgive himself, to never give up, to make the best of what he has available to him, and to program himself wisely. </li><li>I must help my son master himself, pass marshmallow tests, identity with his future, and ultimately empathize with himself.</li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Focus:</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="1uxb0x%253A%2520Unschool%2520Ideas.html">1uxb0x: Unschool Ideas</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="1uxb0x%253A%2520Woodworking.html">1uxb0x: Woodworking</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Daily%2520Stack.html">Daily Stack</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Current%2520Stack%2520Example.html">Current Stack Example</a></li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Vault:</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Planning%2520Future%2520Gameplan%2520for%2520Homeschooling%25201uxb0x.html">Planning Future Gameplan for Homeschooling 1uxb0x</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Old%2520Gameplan%2520for%2520Homeschooling%25201uxb0x.html">Old Gameplan for Homeschooling 1uxb0x</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.04.14%2520-%25201uxb0x%253A%2520Gameplan%2520for%2520Homeschooling.html">2017.04.14 - 1uxb0x: Gameplan for Homeschooling</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="1uxb0x's%2520Wiki%2520Log.html">1uxb0x's Wiki Log</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="1uxb0x%253A%2520Post-Secondary%2520Education.html">1uxb0x: Post-Secondary Education</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="1uxb0x%253A%2520Homeschooling.html">1uxb0x: Homeschooling</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="1uxb0x%253A%2520Grandmaster%2520Electrician.html">1uxb0x: Grandmaster Electrician</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="1uxb0x%253A%2520Gameplan%2520for%2520Homeschooling.html">1uxb0x: Gameplan for Homeschooling</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Mathematics%2520Tutoring%2520Log.html">Mathematics Tutoring Log</a></li><li>Retired:<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.09.16%2520-%2520Retired%253A%25201uxb0x.html">2017.09.16 - Retired: 1uxb0x</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.11.17%2520-%2520Retired%253A%25201uxb0x.html">2017.11.17 - Retired: 1uxb0x</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 class="">Dreams:</h2><ul><li>When my daughter can't come up with practical objects to make or fix, I give her ideas.

So much do I not want to say these words, but I should not get in my own way of saying them. I mean viciously here not in any moral failing sense. Do you understand? I mean something incredibly technical right now, so pay attention. While incompletely MacIntyrianly virtuous in the practice of altruism, my son is MacIntyrianly vicious at the practice of achieving eudaimonia, of life itself, of the means to that end, empathizing with himself in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> We are all on the spectrum, Romans 3:23.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">3 : </span> Romans 6:23</sub></p></div>
