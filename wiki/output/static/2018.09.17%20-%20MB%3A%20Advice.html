Sep 7 7:05 PM
 Hey! It goes well. Working on some Christmas presents today. Trying to get a head start before fall madness sets in.
Sep 8 3:28 PM
 Yay =)
Sep 8 8:09 PM
 how goes it? =)
Sep 11 1:09 PM
 your X-mas presents coming along nicely?
Sep 11 1:09 PM
 What you making (I assume, as a craftswoman/artist, you are making them)?
Sep 11 1:09 PM
 how goes it?
Fri 2:12 PM
 How's your week, and what you up to this weekend?
Sat 12:16 PM
 Hey, how's it going? =)
Mon 9:58 AM
 I'd like to call in a favor:
Mon 1:53 PM
 I am considering reaching out to my donors. Not sure if I should, and I'm not sure how I should do it. I'd like your digested advice. Give me something to think on. Be prepared for me to wrestle with your claim, please. Take your time in formulating your thoughts. You've listened to me many times about it, and I'd like to see it through your eyes.
Mon 1:55 PM
 Hey [[h0p3]], sorry I've been MIA. My grandpa had some health problems and I had to come home to MS a few days ago (long story short: alzheimer's combined with possible prostate and brain cancer, not good). My phone hadn't been sending me your messages and so I didn't know you had contacted me until I randomly opened the app to give yall an update.

In regards to your parents, before I give an opinion or advice: What is the reason you are thinking of reaching out now? That way I'll know how to approach this. 

And sorry if I dont respond immeidately. We've been in an out of hospitals all over like 3 different counties the last week and to say cell signal is poor here is the understatement of the year.
Mon 6:14 PM
 Donors*
Mon 6:15 PM
 I'm sorry about your grandpa. It feels like you have had to head back to MS multiple times in the past year. I totally understand the phone thing (that was my assumption :P).
Mon 6:17 PM
 I think the Golden Rule might require it of me. I think it would heal a lot of damage, a giant rift, in our family.
Mon 6:17 PM
 I am, not by choice, kind of the leader of the younger generation. How they interact with me is the signal to everyone else.
Mon 6:18 PM
 I would be seeking for written communications over my wiki with them.
Mon 6:18 PM
 Several strangers I trust and my family (and you if you wish) will be observing. I want to demonstrate to myself that I've openly tried to bridge this gap.
Mon 6:19 PM
 that said, i do not think I will succeed at all
Mon 6:19 PM
 Do you feel that you have the emotional stamina to begin the project of re establishing contact with them? Or would this be something at the expense of yourself for others?
Mon 6:19 PM
 I think it is a risky thing to do. I anticipate it will damage me.
Mon 6:19 PM
 I see
Mon 6:19 PM
 What do you anticipate happening if you just decide not to engage with them at all? What, for you, would be the worst case scenario?
Mon 6:20 PM
 I think our relationship will continue to sour.
Mon 6:21 PM
 They have accused me of being a drug-dealer (which, I wouldn't have an ethical problem doing, ofc, but I've never actually done it) in front of family and friends. I consider them extremely manipulative people.
Mon 6:22 PM
 Those who know me know better though.
Mon 6:22 PM
 I fear that my children will not see the truth of who these people are in the end.
Mon 6:22 PM
 I think worst case scenario is an attempt at forced visitation rights, maybe even a surprise social services attack.
Mon 6:23 PM
 What has [[k0sh3k]]s input been?
Mon 6:37 PM
 She does not know.
Mon 6:38 PM
 I see why you'd consider re establishing contact now. How is the relationship between them and [[k0sh3k]]? I'm wondering if there is a way to establish a mediator, so that there is contact but maybe not always directly through you, so that you dont have to take on so much emotional damage?
Mon 6:45 PM
 sorry, afk
Mon 7:07 PM
 I'm not sure who is qualified to mediate
Mon 7:07 PM
 I'm not sure this can be mediated either
Mon 7:07 PM
 What are your brothers relationships like with The Donors?
Mon 7:15 PM
 non-existent  for [[AIR]]; 13 foot pole for [[JRE]]
Mon 7:17 PM
 Man, that is a crossroads. The only thing I feel in my gut is to talk it over with [[k0sh3k]]. I dont mean that as a cop out. After asking about the parameters of the situation, if I were in your shoes, the thing I'd do is talk it over with A. And that's the most honest advice I can give... the advice I'd give myself.
a day ago
 You talk it over with [[k0sh3k]]*
a day ago
 Because what I'd do is talk with A*
a day ago
 aye, I appreciate that, thank you =)
a day ago
 we will continue to talk about it quite a bit
a day ago
 I skipped a whole paragraph going from thought to typing, lol.
a day ago
 Keep me updated and come at me playing devils advocate. I'm happy to be a sounding board and helping you talk this through!
a day ago
 I appreciate it! =) I will.
