<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>After visiting the Pipefitters and Plumbers Union, I found out that the earliest I'd be able to join would be in 6 months. So, I decided to go back to the technical school. Serendipitously, I came on the day they started class. They still had my application from when we first moved here, and even knew me by name (which is impressive after only having met me once or twice). They just changed me from Machining (they didn't find a teacher for this class until a couple weeks ago) to Pipefitting in the system, I paid for my tuition and went straight to class. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>: The fellows I'm working with are salt of the Earth. Poor misfits, rough living, etc. I fit in fine if I hide amongst them, which isn't really fitting in. I'm not very good at hiding. I hope defensively-positioned or preemptive kindness will be enough. My sense of humor, my appreciation of substances, an ability to be a librarian for them (which I am happy to do for people), listening without judgment, and perhaps the value they may see in networking with me will be enough to at least have positive relationships with most of them (can't please everyone). 
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>: My brother says I will be an alien among them. He is right, or at least partially right. I do not deny my weirdness. My goal will be to network, specifically ensuring I have the space and freedom I need in my life (political, financial, and social autonomy) without burning bridges. It will be difficult. Here I feel <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="KIN.html">KIN</a>'s pull very strongly. We both build on the Marxist ground (which is obviously practical; it is innately a Redpilled theory [which can be twisted for 'evil' prescriptions]). 
</p></blockquote><p>I barely slept (I was excited and had a lot on my mind) last night. When I got there today, I was taken straight to a computer lab. I'm not even supposed to be in the shop without safety training (although, it seems to be an unenforced rule). Further, I have a ton of timesink busywork they've handed me on the computer. I'm smashing through it though.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> I've jumped ahead with pre-testing, but the rest of the work they let you do either in their lab or at home. I've figured out that they only care about your tests in the computing part, so that's what I'm gunning straight for. I work much faster at home, especially since I have music, a chair that doesn't kill my back, and more tools available to smash. </p><p>Passing all the pretests in a day (or a few hours) is rare. Finishing the entire computer-based learning program in a weekend will be a record at the school. In addition to just catapulting me closer to the actual Pipefitting part of the education (which is why I'm there), I'm hoping it will put me in good graces with the staff (I see that it affects funding/scholarship options). </p><p>My teacher is both made fun of (a functional alcoholic who barely spends time in the shop) but also somehow respected by the students. It will be interesting to see how much he will be able to help me. I'm going to talk to him about a co-op situation where I get to work and go to school. I desperately need to start acquiring work experience in the field. Not only is it crucial practice at the trade itself, but a chance to network, build rep, feel my way out through organizations and the landscape. I do intend to try to get on with the union. I may need to feel out first how he even feels about the union. That said, I don't even know how much his reputation matters or what social capital he has. I have to assume, at least for now, that he is an asset to me (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="RPIN.html">RPIN</a>: &quot;that is a planning issue, not an empathy one. Obviously, I'm looking to preserve my bridges and empathize with the man.&quot;). </p><p>Two guys, Keith and another (don't know his name yet; I forgot!), go out of their way to talk to me. It's nice. One is brand new, the other has been an apprentice for 6 years(didn't move up though, and he says he needs to come back to school to do it [I don't know if this is true]). They've been guiding me about the structure and social norms of the shop and school. They are helping to orient me. I'm glad I have people that I can talk to there, and especially to have people who will try to answer my questions (I have so many that I have to hold it back; it annoys people when I ask too many). </p><p>I may not be going tomorrow. Very likely snowday. Fridays are apparently very relaxed too (heard they just clean the shop and leave at noon). I hope that I will have the chance to push myself hard and become adept at the technical aspects (giving me time to figure out the non-technical aspects in the field with more attention). </p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Yay, my booklearnin' has been useful</sub></p></div>
