<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I met Jaye at the Bojangles near my residence. He then wanted to take separate cars? I asked him why we met in the first place. His answer was to show up at the same time? Hilariously our GPS units took us different routes, and we didn't arrive at the same time. However, we did find the work site together. We were late. I wasn't happy about that.</p><p>We met the main guys. Bull, Spaz (the 65-year-old welder), and Aaron (not a fitter). There is a helper too, but I forgot his name (not a standard name, I believe).
 
We talked to my foreman, Bull. Huge guy, &quot;bull&quot; is for &quot;bullshit&quot; I believe. Very easy going, and he loves to talk. I can let him talk. I was, of course, nearly silent as the other men talked. I observe, and I know I can't join in the small talk fittingly. Bull compliments me, saying he thinks I must spend time lifting weights. I smile. I had told my brother I was looking buff (although, I was joking about it). It's just my new shirt that tricks you into thinking I'm stronger than I am.</p><p>Bull showed us around, and the first job he wanted us to work. It's was a couple of pipes that needed to go up through 2 stories. We only have ladders to work with =(. I hate heights. I'll get used to it though. It's about not empathizing with the &quot;falling&quot; or &quot;scared&quot; you, in a sense. You grow to ignore that part of you. Do it wisely. I asked him how long it would take him to do the job. He said 2 days. Wow. That is fast. I do not feel confident that I can do it nearly that fast, and I told him.</p><p>He then thought about putting us on throwing flanges on the nipples out of the machine. He gave me two wrenches and a flange. I didn't immediately understand what he meant by backup wrench (until he handed me the pipewrench). He meant counterweight. After the misunderstanding, he decided to give an even easier job to me. We went up a 20-foot ladder and hit all the sites on top. I just needed to read the direction flow, mark the pipes, and measure to find out how many flanges he needs of each size. </p><p>We did as he asked, but couldn't reach one of the sites because there was no access. We took a break, got some water, took a piss, then on our way to borrow a boom lift to hit that site, we spotted bull. We talked, and I told him what we had. He seemed happily surprised, I think. I also told him that all the pipes would need to be about 23-24&quot; long if they are going to be 8&quot; off the backside (like he wants). He saw that I knew what we were doing, and we talked about the upside-down L shape we're running off the spigots. </p><p>He then decided to have me plan the parts list and structures for all 14 sites. He showed me the parts he had. My goal is to plan it all, find what parts we need, and have them ordered. We had to hit the roof again to matchup the spigot sizes. I'll need reducers, and I need to know where.</p><p>Jaye and I talked about his parole officer (from the messages and context, I deem her a bitch). He has a lot of problems to work through. It's a good thing he's a skilled welder. He also is the only parent who is willing to work (his wife refuses). I have to say, my life is considerably easier and more interesting than his. I feel bad for him.</p><p>We went to find Bull to see how lunch works. We're getting our bearings around here, understanding where things are, what to do, how they are done, conventions, etc. We ran into the other guys, and I'm told they leave at 3 and then get clocked at 3:30 for driving time. Sounds good to me! </p><p>At lunchtime, we talked. His daughter sounds intelligent and compassionate. He thinks she's a mess, but she sounds wonderful to me. Poli-Sci + social work, well-traveled, social justice work, etc. </p><p>He knew I had only been fitting for 6 months and went to school, but asked me anyways to see what I'd say. Establishing that I'm trustworthy and that I'm humble is important. I explained that I knew I was new at this, and that I was inexperienced. I told him I was here to learn. He said he was glad to hear it, and he would be everything he knew. Cool.</p><p>Bull agreed to give me overtime. He only works 8's, but I'll be working 10's. </p><p>After everyone left, I cleaned up our spot. I went to chiller room #1. I tried taking measurements, but I couldn't really. I don't know what to do here. Hopefully, I think of it on the way there, and perhaps Bull can help. I moved the welding machine to where Bull suggested. I drew up the isometrics for the spools we'll need. I grabbed the fittings and flanges we'll need. </p><p>I took my tools back, and I cleaned my bag out some. I'm trying to limit how many tools I actually carry with me. I can leave many in the car until I actually need them. I had to fill my tires up. I think the heat and weight aren't doing well for them. I just need this car to last for a couple more months. That would do us wonders.</p><p>Also, I took my THC test. I failed it. It's been 72 hours, so I'm not surprised. There was a very faint outline of a line beginning. It is possible that I'll be able to pass it on Friday. I'm hoping so. I think I should wait to take cannabliss until I can pass this test. I need to know my baseline. I should ask my brother about his as well.</p></div>
