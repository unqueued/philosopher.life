<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>In memory of Dr. Bowman.</em></p><hr><p><em>“All women are psycho, all men are jerks.” –Kurt Vonnegut</em></p><p><em>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” - Galatians 3:28 (NASB)</em></p><p>Ancient women, as found in the Old Testament and Euripides’ plays, were not treated with equality. Women are naturally weaker in physical strength. We find in the ancient cultures of the Hebrews and Greeks that women were also viewed as weak in many other aspects of life. They were considered immoral creatures, driven by passion, representing the ‘lesser’ side of humanity. Women were not treated with equality in both the Old Testament and Euripides’ plays, they slaves and second class citizens.</p><p>Ancient societies were patriarchal societies. Men ruled the house, men ruled the state, and men controlled the market. Men were allowed to have polygamous relations; while women were whores and unclean if they were polygamous. Both the Old Testament and Euripides’ plays express obvious patriarchal societies as the setting. Women were treated as objects and property. They were the vessels of shame and misery. They followed the male head of the household or they died. Women were slaves. Some women were referred to as servants and concubines and mistresses, but we should be deceived. Since these women still did not have choice/power in how they wished to live their lives, they were clearly slaves—property to be ordered around. The similarities between the rights, liberties (or lack thereof), and treatment found between women and slaves are astonishing. Women at best were second class citizens—a true citizen actually has power of him or herself.</p><p>A person reading the book of Genesis could easily read that women were responsible for the “fall” of mankind. Adam said, “’The women whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate’” (Genesis 3:12). The Lord asks Even, “What is this that you have done?” in a very accusatory tone, as if the woman was completely at fault for the “fall” (Genesis 3:13). The Lord answered in retribution towards all women, “yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you” (Genesis 3:16b). The Hebrews had justification for their treatment of women. The Hebrews could simply say that the Lord made it such that women were to be subservient to men. Obviously, the text appears to promote a patriarchal slavery of women rather than an egalitarian view.</p><p>Euripides portrays women as crazed, jealous, emotional, backstabbing sex-fiends. In the eyes of the Greeks, women are seductive, highly sexual, immoral predators. However, Euripides was ahead of his time. To his credit, Euripides was generous enough to actually even consider displaying the experiences of women. A normal Greek would not have been as concerned with the feelings and experiences of the women found after the Trojan war. So, in a sense, Euripides was promoting the value of women more-so than a normal Greek would be expected to uphold.</p><p>The relationship between Sarah and Hagar, of the Old Testament, is very similar to the relationship of Andromache and Hermione, found in the Euripidean play Andromache. Although slightly different, these two stories offer a distinct parallel between how the two cultures perceived women and how women ‘supposedly’ interacted with each other.</p><p>Sarah is the wife of Abraham. Hagar is the concubine and slave of Abraham. Sarah is unable to bear children and therefore goes and gives Abraham her hand-servant Hagar. Abraham conceives a son, Ishmael, with Hagar. Sarah becomes jealous of Hagar. Sarah conceives evil plans for Hagar, and eventually is able to banish Hagar from Abraham’s household.</p><p>Hermione is the wife of Neoptolemus. Andromache is the slave and mistress of Neoptolemus. Hermione is unable bear children. Andromache bears a child for Neoptolemus. Hermione becomes jealous of Andromache. Hermione conceives of evil plans for Andromache, wishing death upon Andromache.</p><p>Comparatively, these stories reflect the jealousy found between wives and concubines. As Hermione states, “it is not decent for one man to keep two women in the reins of marriage. No, the man who wishes to live with propriety is content if he looks to a single loved one in his bed” (Morwood 81). Sarah hated Hagar just as Hermione hated Andromache. Sarah and Hermione played the desperately jealous, evil, and conniving wives, while Hagar and Andromache appear to play more innocent roles. Hagar and Andromache were forced to sleep with their owners; Sarah and Hermione always wanted to sleep with and bear children for their husband/owners, but were unable. </p><p>Out of both the Old Testament and the Euripidean plays, we find an emerging concept of women’s roles: they were to have sex, have kids, and raise the children. But, there appears to be slightly different slants on perspectives on women as a sexual being in these two texts.</p><p>In contrast, women of the Old Testament were not seen as the same sex-fiends as found in the Euripidean plays. Old Testament women were portrayed more as weak-willed and immoral, failing to fear the Lord. Lot’s wife and his daughters both showed a lack of will power to fear the Lord and abstain from incestual relations with their father. Sarah laughed at the Lord. Eve was the first human to sin. The main perspective on women was that because they were immoral and weak-willed they were, under the Lord’s command, to be subjugated under males. It seems that at first women became slaves of men because the Lord commanded it. However, it appears that the subjugation and demeaning treatment of women in Euripides’ plays was always the accepted opinion of the Greeks. The enslavement of women seems to be based on two different ideas. Women were enslaved for Hebrews because the lord commanded it, while the Greeks enslaved women because they absolutely felt females were a lesser class of humanity. It is more difficult to infer that the Hebrews explicitly felt that women were not equal—whereas we could easily infer that women were not equal to men for the Greeks. The basis of inequality separates these two cultures. The Hebrews may not have believed women were unequal to men, they simply treated women unequal because the Lord commanded them to do so. This is far different from the explicit degradation and lower value of women found in Euripidean plays.</p><p>Women in both the Old Testament and Euripides’ plays experienced very similar circumstances. They were servants, slaves, concubines, and wives. They were seen as immoral and weak. They were second-class citizens of humanity. Women were not equal to men; this may have been the greatest tragedy in both the Old Testament and Euripides’ plays.
