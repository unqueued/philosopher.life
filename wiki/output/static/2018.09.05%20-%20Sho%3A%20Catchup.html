 sorry for delay

 if you're not offended I might just copy/paste smoe stuff here from an email i just sent a friend who I was also owing a catch-up message to lol
5 hours ago
 Hey man

Sorry for delay. As you can imagine we've just been trying to get along from day to day, here. All this stress and shit, we had some communication breakdowns and tension and whatnot; took Monday off cause it was meant to be a nice day and went down to Harris, but that just ended up with us having a wee breakdown and then ed went in the sea and i went to the far end of the beach and cried on a rock for a couple of hours, begging it to open up and swallow me into the earth, but it didn't. Anyway, after a whiley Ed came over and we talked and I cried a lot and i think whatever was going on came to a head, finally, we've been okay since. Had a smoke and a wander up to an amazing standing stone after (I think Ed put a few photos on his facebook if you've not seen them). Anyway, I took yesterday for cleaning and sorting some filing (STILL working through my music collection to edit out all the shite I've accumulated over the years that I don't actually like/want) and similar today. Fuck it. What is being self-employed about if not to take time when you're losing your shit thus ensuring losing your shite somewhere down the line from money shortages but anyway, c'est la vie :P
5 hours ago
 Currently looks as though we'll be heading back down to fife (in caravan) for the winter, probably leave in a month or so give or take. We'll know more in another week or twa after Ed's got the council cuntybaws out to tell us the details about the ways in which they're going to try to ruin our lives, waste the very little money we have for no good reason, all under the threat of eviction from a property that we actually own. The plan is to find out all that shite, get the advice needed etc., then Ed will have to organise putting in an application for building warrant etc. So, the hope is to come back here in spring with permission to live in the caravan and the building warrants/plans issued so Ed will know exactly how to go about things (and how not to get in trouble with the legal bastards during/after). So, not only does that postpone our living here a lot, which is gutting emotionally as well as mentally really destabilising :P but it also means at the end we may not have a finished house. We may have just enough to get the basics of the house built and then live in an unfinished house for the foreseeable future. You ken, no proper walls or floors or any of that. Not sure when we'll be able to get a boiler and heating system in. Etc. And this is all assuming the cunt doesnae turn up next week and tell Ed the gable ends are no good (of an old style of construction they definitely dinnae use anymore) and have to come down, in which case we're fucked because there is nowhere near enough money to demolish what's here and start from scratch. One of the reasons this place was attractive, in that sense, was because it had a house on it already so didn't need planning permission. Turns out planning is just the tip of a big fucking bullshit iceberg, and we MAY be the Titanic. We just dinnae ken, yet. 

Ed said if they won't let us live here then we're buying a big van to live in a plot of land in portugal. 

I hate the idea of leaving Scotland but fucking hell, if it becomes that necessary... sigh

Fun times!

 i love copy/paste. now you're caught up lol

 god damn, that sucks =/

 Regulatory Capture designed to squeeze the poor for everything they are worth
2 hours ago
 I'm no libertarian, but I legit don't see a moral reason you shouldn't be able to live on land you own as you intend when it clearly endangers no one.
2 hours ago
 well, if you do the portugal thing, be sure to doxx and burn the houses down (those without children) before you leave as a departing gift to those fuckers
2 hours ago
 haha, the folk who live here are helpful as fuck
2 hours ago
 it's just the whole 'law' thing
2 hours ago
 i mean, i get some degree of oversight is necessary
2 hours ago
 most esp to protect the environment
2 hours ago
 but it is pretty fucking bullshit crazy how far they go
2 hours ago
 as far as to say you can't put your bathroom here because then tall people can't pee comfortably
2 hours ago
 it's like, IT'S MY HOUSE AND I'M NOT TALL
2 hours ago
 ken what i mean?
2 hours ago
 and like, the fact that we cannae live here bc there's no sewage
2 hours ago
 even tho we have legal/safe ways to dispose of our nasty
2 hours ago
 that is not how and why such laws are wielded here in the states; I assumed too far, I take it
2 hours ago
 can just take it to the public toilets down the road
2 hours ago
 what, you mean you didn't think the laws were legit about protecting the environment?
2 hours ago
 to a small degree they are and that's the degree i'm ok with
2 hours ago
 but i do think ultimatley it is far more about disempowering people and keeping t hem under control, under the thumb, under watch
2 hours ago
 and as poor and stressed and scared as possible
2 hours ago
 i mean, apparnetly we'd not be allowed to stay in OUR HOUSE
2 hours ago
 because it has no heatin gsystem, as a for instance
2 hours ago
 well, isn't that our fuckin gproblem?
2 hours ago
 what the fuck do they think people did before there were central water boilers?
2 hours ago
 i mean, some of it it is in the name of 'safety'
2 hours ago
 and of course bc weather here can get quite severe they want to make sure folk aren't putting up some house or living in a caravan that will get blown over
2 hours ago
 but people have done all of the above for years
2 hours ago
 it's more recent they're more strict
2 hours ago
 personally I think t he thing against caravans is because they don't want the place looking like it's full of tinks when the rich southern tourists come up on their holidays#
2 hours ago
 honestly, i think that's a huge part of it
2 hours ago
 bingo
2 hours ago
 being in a caravan here can be dangerous, but it never stopped people for the decades previous
2 hours ago
 there are ways of securing them
2 hours ago
 it's also that thing of oh, you all must be too stupid to build something safe to live in
2 hours ago
 not that i think most people aren't stupid
2 hours ago
 but i also think it's their own damned business if they build a house and the roof gets ripped off in a storm
2 hours ago
 it's not like the govt helps people in that situaiton, anyway, financially
2 hours ago
 then there's the occasional argument around, because we have a public health service, things need to be more controlled
2 hours ago
 like seatbelts
2 hours ago
 i always felt that was a personal choice
2 hours ago
 but considering that here, if you are fucked upb ecause of not wearin ga seatbelt then the taxpayers have to pay for your care...
2 hours ago
 i can kind of see that
2 hours ago
 but at the same time, what about people who smoke/drink too much/eat too much sugar/caffeiene etc?
2 hours ago
 it's just all a bit silly
2 hours ago
 plus, what the fuck is insurance for?
2 hours ago
 i mean, it costs a bomb, surely there is SOME purpose to it? :P
2 hours ago
 so, i dinnae ken
2 hours ago
 when ed said yestrday they dude may say we cannae live here at all, like, at all
2 hours ago
 i started thinking about killing him
2 hours ago
 so i started thinking about something else instead
2 hours ago
 sigh
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 i'm really sad about leaving
2 hours ago
 it's JUST STARTING to feel a bit like we live here
2 hours ago
 but also we're having to prepare to go
2 hours ago
 i fucking dinnae want to live in fife
2 hours ago
 fuck fife

2 hours ago
 which is just as well eh lol
2 hours ago
 even if he'd wanted to, we could never afford it
2 hours ago
 the village/area he's from has been MEGA uber gentrified
2 hours ago
 in fact it's another downer about being there
2 hours ago
 because it upsets ed, seeing how things have gone
2 hours ago
 how tehre are almost no locals left
2 hours ago
 the school struggles to stay open#
2 hours ago
 no shops to buy things in locally
