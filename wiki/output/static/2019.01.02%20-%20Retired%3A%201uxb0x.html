</p></blockquote><p>My son is my enigma. I continually fail to model him. He surprises me all the time. Sometimes my autism makes it so that I know exactly where he's coming from in a uniquely difficult way to appreciate, but sometimes I'm completely at a loss. I do not know how to be a good rolemodel for my son because I do not sufficiently understand him. I race with everything to find him in the desert!</p><p><strong>I am coming, son!! Keep doing your best!!!</strong> My wiki will reach you. I will build a literary structure unlike any in history to reach you.</p><p>We must rapidly build common ground and build towards his happiness. It is crucial to me that I prevent an uncrossable gulf from forming between us. I think our wikis will be the most important communications tools between us. I'm going to build a wiki that my son can use to model me and teach him how to model himself and others. </p><p>1uxb0x is exceptionally altruistic, kind, and profoundly concerned with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>. My son is perhaps the most moral human being I've ever met, except to himself. My son does not respect himself in a consistent manner, does not recognize his own dignity in a fitting way, and dehumanizes himself when he is saddest. Like every terrible father: I pass my demons on. I must teach him to love himself as best I can. My son deserves my respect, and I must teach him to seek his own approval as wisely as possible. Empathy is a complex problem for autists, and I will use everything in my power to help him accurately model and identify with his <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="4DID.html">4DID</a>.</p><p>My son didn't speak until he was 4, and it has been a torturous uphill battle to help him become functional. I am afraid for him; I'm afraid of what his life will be like. I desperately want him to have the tools to be self-sufficient, to avoid persecution, and to be happy on his own terms. He fills me with hope when I watch him make quantum leaps I did not realize he was capable of. He is clearly intelligent, even if unpredictably and perplexingly so. I should not underestimate my son, but I also should not apply too much pressure. It is a difficult balance to strike. It is not my goal to duplicate myself in my son, but I hope to give him what tools I have (and beyond) that suit him. Every day is an uncharted territory with him, and we will seize that opportunity. Life gets better for my son; I have seen it. </p><hr><h2 class="">Principles:</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Be%2520A%2520Good%2520Dad.html">Be A Good Dad</a></li><li>Find practical activities my son benefits from.
