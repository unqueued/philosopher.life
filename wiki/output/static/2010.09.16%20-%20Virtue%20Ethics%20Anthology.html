<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Chapter 8:</p><p>1 – pg 164 – It seems exceedingly difficult to show (and therefore the point is not clear)how the virtues are beneficial. We have serious problems like: “to whom are the Virtues beneficial?” and “Are Virtues always beneficial, or just on average beneficial?” and “How is this any different from Utility?”</p><p>2 – pg 165 – This seems patently false. I believe that being “just” or “charitable” doesn’t benefit me always (rarely even), but rather detracts from my finances and overall-wellbeing. Unless we want to claim that having these characteristics innately makes me “happier” or “better” in the same way the psychologist egoist might claim, we’ll have to admit that Virtues don’t directly benefit the Virtuous as much as another theory (“Look out for #1” Utilitarianism) might.</p><p>3 – pg 165 – I can’t help but wonder if a purely naturalistic account of Virtue might not also speak of “excellence” of the physical body, and thus also not about “excellence” over that which we might have more/full control over. Thankfully, the author here makes the distinction.</p><p>4- pg 165 – Surely we must be talking about that for which we are ultimately responsible. Libertarian Freewill is the very basis of the will, and thus also the basis of moral responsibility. Without the Will, we would not be having a discussion about ethics at all, only determined bits of matter doing as they must, as opposed to doing as they chose to do while having the actual potential to do otherwise. Either it will be the physical laws (or the creator of such laws) that is responsible for what you do, or you yourself, as an unmoved mover will be the cause of your actions and thus also ultimately responsible for what you chose to do.</p><p>5 – pg 165 – We would cite these “failures” intentionally choosing to be ignorant or indifferent. So, if you lacked an intention where you should have had one, there was a previous choice in which you chose to be indifferent to circumstances for which you should have had a particular intention.</p><p>6 –pg 166 – Let us also argue that insofar as we have control over our phsyio/biological desires and how they impact our thoughts we are responsible for it and it must be part of the account of the Will.</p><p>7 – pg 166 – If Wisdom is a sort of knowledge, why can’t think count as a type of Virtue? It is a belief. Virtues are beliefs that you Will from and upon; Wisdom seems perfectly capable of this.</p><p>8 – pg 167 – This is exactly what Utility is doing. Wisdom IS the decision procedure in Virtue ethics. All other virtues flow from it, and all other Virtues are defined and understood through Wisdom calculations.</p><p>9 –pg 167 – This is a good way to define wisdom, especially as it is distinct from cleverness or even some generic intelligence. Wisdom requires knowledge of WHAT is good and bad, while intelligence just knows how to get to any end, not necessarily good ones. Wisdom is then a special type of Knowledge, and by far, the most difficult in the Utility calculation. Intelligence is distinct from knowledge. Wisdom then can be distinct from Intelligence. The Will chooses to acquire more wisdom through intelligent processes. You must have a starting set of “wisdom” and belief about value to even go on to pursue it at all. This is the axiomatic and begged “value theory”.</p><p>I think therefore I am; I think there is value, there it actually does exist; If there was no value, then I couldn’t have thought about it, and I wouldn’t be able to pursue it.</p></div>
