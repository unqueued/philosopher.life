<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><pre><code>    Reading – A brief summary of the issue.

    Examples of storage and distribution technologies

    DRM (Digital Rights Management) – prevent unlawful use, access, or distribution

        Encryption

        Proprietary formats &amp; codecs

        Activation keys &amp; serials

        Hardware keys (dongles)

        Digital watermarks

        Moving away from ‘sale’ paradigm to ‘licensing’ paradigm

        Aggressive anti-hack policies (world of warcraft) – reading/searching memory and current programs – slurping and analyzing your information - losing rights to your own hardware and software

        Is this a failure to understand that the business model is obsolete? Server-end content (mainframe/cloud mentality) vs. client-end content. WoW private/live example.

    Legal concepts of Intellectual Property (as being distinct from philosophical/ethical concepts)

        Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks

    Reading – Copyrights

        Can’t protect concepts or principles

        Protects computer databases &amp; programs because they exhibit authorship and original expressions of ideas.

    Reading – Patents

        The lines between copyright and patents blur when it comes to software. They are both inventions and objects with authorship/expressions of ideas.

    Discuss Patents for Algorithms, mathematics, software, symbolic logic.

    Read – Trademarks

        Infringement &amp; Dilution

    Digital Millennium Copyright Act

        Interpretation is ongoing.

        Computers and logic can do anything, and that makes interpretation very difficult. There are seriously unintuitive results of this law.

        From my experience, those judges and legislatures (even with a lot of help) are not technically qualified to realize all the essentials and salient features of these ethical problems to make sound decisions.

        IP Rights, particularly patents, are bought defensively. Motorola/Google. IBM is one of the few patent companies that have shown some serious altruism (and not because they are innate market disruptors like Google) – do not expect others to do this.

        Law is not what we have written down – it is what is practiced. I lived in Thailand for a few years, and while it was ‘written in the law’ that one must obey traffic signs, lights, and markings, the fact is that it was never enforced or even taken seriously (except in rare circumstances). If law is what is practiced, then this document doesn’t really cover what is ‘legal’.

        ICE (US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement) takedowns

        Lack of due process

        Defamation

        SOPA, PROTECT IP Act, ACTA

    Reading – ‘Fair Use’

    Reading – ‘Nature of software piracy’

    Reading – ‘Case against piracy’

        Claim: Software piracy is increasingly engaged in for profit by professional thieves. Again, software piracy, by legal definition, is not theft. This is a complicated claim. What stage of the piracy are they talking about?

            Piracy is a group effort. There are literally teams (clubs if you’re are german ;P) and digital reputations. Teams do not really make money at piracy.

            There are the hackers and crackers who break the DRM, make keygens, steal keys, get around security features, and sometimes break into corporate networks to grab information. (not just software, I remember reading the last Harry Potter novel a week before it came out; I remember “Minutes to Midnight” Link park album a month before it was officially released). These tools generally become free to the public a while later (depending on how big it is).

            There are people who essentially do marketing for the teams, and those who design software and aesthetic pieces for the team, and there are those who work on the releases and distribution. The releases are free and traded for either other pieces, but generally just improve a type of reputation.

            Piracy is largely free and not done for profit, by and large. There are people who can make money, off advertisements, but most cases, it isn’t. There are poor nations around the world, like Thailand, where you can buy pirated software. This accounts for but a fraction of the actual piracy happening in the world.

        The impact extends far and wide, harming economies worldwide, diminished taxes, revenues, and lost jobs. This is an empirical claim which is not in his favor. Most of the stats you’ll see are underwritten by copyright holders. Independent studies do not suggest this at all.

        ‘remove the income, remove the incentive’ – a supreme failure to understand human arts and production in history, and also a failure to understand the history of computer science. The most widely used computer software is free software, by miles. GNU licenses and free software movement. Stallman, linux, etc. incentive is there – economists are wrong to assume there is no altruism in the world. They are also wrong to assume the free-software model isn’t a working business model. Even large software developers contribute to free software/open source – Microsoft and Google for example.
