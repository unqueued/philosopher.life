<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Respond to the following gem:</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>We have to understand very clearly that there's a man in our community called a capitalist. Sometimes he's black and sometimes he's white. But that man has to be driven out of our community because anybody who comes into the community to make profit off of people by exploiting them can be defined as a capitalist.
</p></blockquote><p>This is a fascinating in/outgrouping prescription here. I love how profoundly broad and accurate he's constructed the description of a capitalist. I believe exploitation and slavery extend much further than most people will openly recognize or even attempt to imagine. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a> particularizes to our context all the way down, and it generates exceedingly complex Hohfeldian rights clusters and relationships. I am continually dismayed to see even learned people fail to appreciate both the detail and expansive scope of the moral fabric of our lives. This quote is such a strong claim, and I suggest it is gettin' after it.</p><p>It's a fact: we have to punish those who aren't aiming to be just. That is justice. It is retributive both as a means to restorative justice and for pre-emptively reinforcing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. Not all identities, desires, and beliefs are equal; some are just plain wrong, destructive, and require us to respond. Evil is a disease that grows in each of us, and we each have a duty to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a> to implement, legislate, enforce, and adjudicate <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> qua <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>.</p><p>It is all too easy to be wrong, to be spiteful, to be malicious, to be unjust in the appearance of serving justice. This is why when <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="IA2DYJ.html">IA2DYJ</a>, I try to be hedged-conservative. I need buffer. I cannot say I draw the lines well enough, but I am doing my best.</p><p>What I appreciate about the quote is how decentralized networks of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> will filter out and defeat those who play worse than <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T4T.html">T4T</a> (and apply pressure to be forgiving to those who otherwise wouldn't). The best way to ensure that people are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="good.html">good</a> persons is to hold each other accountable. We see this behavior in smaller groups and close geographic proximity; we've evolved to exhibit the behaviors of vulnerable primates in up-close-and-personal physical settings (to varying <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>). This becomes harder as we virtualize our relationships. I suggest, however, that feasible a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a> principle still exist. Admittedly, it takes more cognitive effort to train empathy in such practices, but it can be done. We have to understand how we project ourselves into virtual mediums, and the consequential and instrumental reasoning necessary for being conscientious <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a> becomes radically more abstract. I say this as a man who is obviously <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> and hypocritical.</p><p>Indeed, the quote extends well beyond what Hampton initially envisioned, imho. I recognize a number of schools of thought which seek to deny it. One such group are the effective altruists, the self-styled neo-rationalists whom I take to be egoistic empiricists (which is hilarious to me). I have seen it dismissed as mere culture wars. Mmmhmm, OK. I see what that's code for.</p></div>
