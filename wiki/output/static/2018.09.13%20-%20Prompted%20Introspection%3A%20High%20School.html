<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What's your most treasured memory from high school?</h2><p>I have different memories I treasure for different reasons. </p><p>I wasn't in high school very long. In my middle schools, they'd send me to high schools for band (national marching band champs) and mathematics. It was cool. I hung out with burnout seniors. They could not have been more hospitable to an outsider (they called me &quot;the pre-freshman&quot;). They really taught me something important! I was a tiny middle schooler too; I looked like I was 10. I miss those guys; I'm gonna bet life didn't turn out great for them. =( It's a bittersweet memory.</p><p>Mary Joy Manalastas, a fucking 9 (she's still ridiculously hot), chose to sit next to me in a couple classes. I generally didn't know which or why any girls liked me (most wouldn't be caught dead with me because I was one of the poor kids), and I generally didn't know anyone liked me until someone told me (same story with my wife; I'm blind as fuck). Maybe Mary Joy was just fucking with me (how would I know?), but looking back on our times together, I think she was flirting with me often enough.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> I still look back fondly on her vivid descriptions of her masturbation sessions (even had the lipbiting faces to go with it!). What the fuck was I doing with my life? /facepalm. Oh, yeah, I &lt;3 computers.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">m1</sup></button></p><p>I was bored in school (I wish I went to a real school), and that's what got me into hacking. This was two decades ago: statute of limitations, I was a minor, and I'm not that person anymore. I stumbled onto a nice little hack to run software on their NT machines (they were decently locked down). Gave me an idea. I ended up bringing some skiddie tools from astalavista/neworder/10pht to access and break password files. Started cracking them at home. One particular day in social studies the teacher walked out for 5 minutes, I was a teacher's pet, and my work was done, so I could do whatever. I kept my floppies handy and grabbed her passwords. I had enough logins to eventually remote deep into the Board of Education (56k modems were still the bees-knees to me). Teacher's email revealed network-wide e-mail to all teachers with the ADMIN password (still remember it: <code>@@@</code>) to the STI program (grading). Of course, I never damaged anything and I don't change grades because that's not fair. Curious, stupid kid (maybe I've learned nothing?). Anyways, two &quot;friends&quot; of mine ratted me out. Ended up making peace with one. Hell, I ended up making peace with some teachers because I jumped into college and afterwards started teaching high school alongside them; it was a weird experience.</p><p>What can I do to ensure these years are amazing for my children too? <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h.html">j3d1h</a> starts high school in 2 years!!</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">m1 : </span> I saved for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Monster-%25CE%25A6.html">monster-1</a> for years. It was such a badass machine, and a failure too...lol.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">a : </span> I had a cool jacket in 9th grade, just got over my skater/bmx thing, and I was a pokemon god!...I've still done things I've never read about anyone accomplishing in that game (my full defense Chansey could take 6 hacked lvl 255 Mewtwos). So cool. Lol. Needless to say, I'm actually a very ugly and uncool man (surprise!). </sub></p></div>
