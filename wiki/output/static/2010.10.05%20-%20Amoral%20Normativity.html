<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Goals are to be understood as a holistic relational set of subgoals which taken together are thought to bring about the endgoal1. Evaluating subgoals becomes somewhat complicated by holism. The probability of subgoals actually bringing about endgoals may influence how we can define rationality as well. Assuming no problems arise in these issues, Okrent believes these subgoals (and likely the endgoal as well) are normative. This is essential to his theory. He explains that a “norm is a standard, model, or pattern that is used in an evaluation.”2 Standard normativity words, such as ‘ought’, ‘should, ‘good’, and ‘bad’ can only be understood after an objective evaluation of an object or event with its appropriate norm. Physical objects like apples and salt water are subject to normativity, and, more important to Okrent’s larger argument, events are subject to normativity. As Okrent severs the actual effects of an event from the goal(s) which led to those effects, he believes that the effects of events are evaluated by the intended holistic goals as the norm.</p><p>The effects of subgoals are normatively evaluated by the subgoal as the standard norm. The effects are compared to the expectation of the agent. Insofar as the effects brought about the intended subgoal, they are ‘good’. Normative evaluation of effects is relative to the subgoal which brought about those effects. In the eyes of Okrent, for one to fail in the pursuit of a subgoal does not prevent an agent from maintaining the intentions of the endgoal.</p><p>In trying to make better sense of his argument, I believe that an agent’s initial selection of the subgoals for the endgoal (as a holistic procedure) is subject to Okrent’s normativity. As the effects of subgoals are normatively evaluated by the corresponding subgoal, subgoals are normatively evaluated by the holistic endgoal. Subgoals are themselves normatively evaluated to how effectively they work in tandem with the holistic set of subgoals to bring about the endgoal. You may, for example, select a normatively wrong subgoal required in the holistic relationship to arrive at the endgoal. This subgoal selection process isn’t a one-time deal, either, and thus there will be multiple stages of evaluation.</p><p>At each subgoal step, depending on what subgoals have failed and succeeded, the normative route an agent ‘ought’ to take on a decision-tree of possible subgoals will be a rubric by which an agent is responsible for adjusting their actual subgoals. An agent may normatively be wrong (to some extent) in these subgoal selection processes and still be said to intend the endgoal. I do think Okrent is required to give an account of the percentage of this subgoal selection process which must be ‘normatively correct’ in order for the agent to be said to rationally be goal-directed. Otherwise, the object which the field teleologist is observing simply isn’t adaptive or rational enough to be said to have a goal.</p><p>Also, note that even the endgoal may fail to come about in Okrent’s world. This failure makes the instance normatively ‘bad’ compared to a successful rendering of the endgoal. Nevertheless, Okrent will maintain an agent’s intentionality and goal-directness, even when the endgoal itself is not brought about.</p><p>I hope I’ve been fair to Okrent’s argument because, if I have understood him correctly, then I really question whether it has captured the fabric of moral experience (which is paramount in my view). Here’s the kicker - I have a fundamental disagreement with Okrent about what it means for something to be normative. Pressed to answer, I think Okrent doesn’t mean moral normativity; he’s talking about some sort of amoral normativity. My claim (some will find it controversial) is that there is no such thing as normativity outside of morality. I believe the words ‘ought’, ‘should’, ‘good’, and ‘bad’ entail moral normativity. Our disagreement here has profound implications to his theory.</p><p>Take for example what it means for physical objects to be subject to normativity. What does it mean for an apple to be good? By Okrent’s account, it is ‘bad’ or ‘good’ as a result of its evaluation against the norm of ‘appleness’. So, we are forced to ask, how does one construct norms in Okrent’s world? How can we come to understand the objective nature of these norms? Okrent explains that “most uses of evaluative terms are relative.”3 The best way I can make sense of this is to say that an object’s normative evaluation is relative to the circumstance, and, in at case, ‘appleness’, as a norm, is the sum of the simultaneous subnorms regarding different possible circumstances for an apple. Here he can maintain both the overall objective evaluation and the relative value of apples in different circumstances. So, what is my problem with this?</p><p>Apples aren’t moral agents. They don’t make moral choices. Apples only have value insofar as they pertain to moral agents making choices. Without moral agency, apples have no meaning. Without relating to a moral agent, it is mere happenstance and circumstantially amoral and non-normative for this apple to be different from that apple, or this apple to causally bring about this circumstance where another apple won’t. If it isn’t moral, why should the apple have these features instead of those? It wouldn’t matter. The apple’s features only matter in relation to the choices of moral agents, and because of this, apples aren’t normatively evaluable in the way that intentions are evaluable (Okrent disagrees). Intentions can carry meaning independently; apples can’t. I can’t make sense of one apple being ‘better’ than another, except in how these apples define the circumstances in which a moral agent finds himself having to make a choice.</p><p>If I’m starving, the rock in my hand is not very valuable, but an apple would be. Any attempt at normativity of the class of rock really fails hard here; it is because the rock is not like the apple that it isn’t valuable. This is directly against Okrent’s understanding of normativity of objects, as he thinks objects are evaluated by classes or types4 rather than circumstances and choices of the moral agent.</p><p>Some might explain that we make ‘normative statements’ about objects all the time. To this I say, we can certainly be wrong when we talk about an amoral thing as somehow being normative. We are just confused when we do that. Take this statement: ‘The car should start when I turn the key in the ignition’. The car itself isn’t an agent responsible for starting, obviously. I might, however, be opining about the moral obligations of the engineers of that car – that is, my statement really means, ‘The engineers of this car should have arranged for the car to start when I turn the key in the ignition.’</p><p>The normativity of intentions is something to which I will agree, but not in the same way that Okrent views it. Consider how Okrent’s theory will approach the following example: If a person maliciously intends to destroy a building with people inside it, then he should do X, Y, Z, and detonate explosives at certain points in the building. The endgoal is the destruction of this building, and the subgoals are X,Y,Z, and the detonation, all which are holistically related and probably going to bring about the endgoal. Normativity begins with the effectiveness of bringing about the endgoal. Normativity is relative to the endgoal. And, here, Okrent has truly failed to capture the essence of normativity. Normativity is objective.</p><p>Why ‘should’ the agent pursue X, Y, Z, and detonation? Is it because it brings about the end-goal? Okrent has failed to identify whether or not the agent ‘should’ pursue the end-goal at all. ‘Should an agent destroy the building’ will affect whether or not ‘the agent should detonate explosives’. The normativity of the subgoals rests upon the objective normativity of the goal. Is it a goal worth pursuing? If it isn’t (as in this case), then the goal is bad, and so are the subgoals.</p><p>Okrent has conflated the aretaic concept of ‘virtue of the practice’ and moral virtue, taking virtue of the practice as being normative in a meaningful sense. The vast majority of normative ethics (and frankly any adequate view of normativity) severs these two ideas, whereby only ‘moral virtue’ actually has moral worth and meaningful normativity. Virtue of the practice lacks meaning and value outside of moral virtue – at best, it is merely a slave to moral virtue. Even then, I think it is an uphill battle to suggest that success and failure of actions in probabilistic causal circumstances actually have moral merit (even utilitarian decision procedures must take into account the odds of an action failing in a circumstance before it can render judgment).</p><p>1 Mark Okrent.
