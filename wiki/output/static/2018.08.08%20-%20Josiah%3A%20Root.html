<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>Que s√ßay-je?</em></p><p>Hey Josiah,</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I read a lot of your wiki. Its interesting because its &quot;prolix&quot;. By which I mean the thoughts develop though iteration. Its one of the very few wiki I ever bothered reading through.
</p></blockquote><p>Thank you for reading and making sense of it. That's one of the reasons <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Root%2520Users.html">you have root</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">r</sup></button> I want to say I appreciate your positive spin on that word &quot;prolix,&quot; which is often a word that has negative connotations.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">p</sup></button> I talk about the negative side of it often enough.</p><p>Iterative development is exactly what I'm forced to do. I'm still looking for ways to improve on this front as well. Currently, I'm migrating {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Axioms%2520of%2520h0p3.html">Axioms of h0p3</a>} into {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>}. I believe it will take many years to have something stable and relatively clean (or, I hope so). Growth is a process, and I'm glad to have a flexible tool for it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It is different than much stuff on the net which tends to &quot;the statement&quot;, not &quot;the exploration&quot;.
</p></blockquote><p>I consider that high praise, thank you. I also think there's a fundamental problem of philosophy embedded in it which I can't quite tease out (although, I'm working on it). It may be another way of talking about the dialectic. The exploration is the statement, and perhaps we hit a kind of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="infinigress.html">infinigress</a>. Maybe one can be primitive to the other. I actually do <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> to have a statement that acts as a reasonable foundation for myself in the end.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You writing style very much reminds me of writer-philosophers who consider self-reflection the essence of both life AND writing.</p><p>The closest analogy I can think of is Montaigne.
</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, that is what I hope to practically teach my children too.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">c</sup></button> Iteratively building ourselves and self-reflective tools in order to model ourselves and the world with increasingly accuracy is <em>how</em> we find out <em>why</em>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">e</sup></button> <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.08.08%2520-%2520PPP%253A%2520Montaigne.html">Montaigne</a> is a rolemodel; I do want to be myself for a living. He seemed to think his writing and himself were unified in a profound way. </p><p>Do you think I should make a special study of his writing? I finished <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Infinite%2520Jest.html">Infinite Jest</a>, and while I see some commonalities, I hope to escape some of those trappings (he never did defeat the postmodern beast, I fear). I want to improve at my art, and looking at close analogies may be useful to me. I want to learn from their successes and mistakes.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Your approach is really good. You comments, at points, about some people who &quot;don't get it&quot;, are accurate. But, IMO, you don't need labour those points. Readers will get it. People not into it are unlikely to ever get it.
</p></blockquote><p>I will refrain then. Thank you for the saying this (you have a right to speak more forcefully and negatively if you wish). There's a weird problem which arises in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">Find The Others</a> that makes me feel obligated to apologize and explain that problem (pretty often). I also think it's important that I lay out the rules and justifications for myself. I have gotten far enough. I'm probably going to have to come to grips with the need to lower my expectations/predictions/hopes on this front.</p><p>Part of the issue is that I hope to build a bridge back to family who really haven't taken the time to get to know me. They really might not ever want to &quot;get it.&quot; I will try to find the center of your advice here. I appreciate your willingness to give it.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>On the tech side, maybe, in time, you could offer visitors a notification system for updates they could sign-up to?
</p></blockquote><p>You're not the first to ask for this. I responded to this request before <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.07.09%2520-%2520Mark%2520Slater%253A%2520RSS.html">2018.07.09 - Mark Slater: RSS</a>. Perhaps this is a sign that I really don't understand what I'm making or my process, but I'm having a hard time understanding what kinds of updates would be worth notifying others about. I mean, I know what excites me, but as an autistic person, I'm pretty awful at making that determination for others often enough. There's 10-15 <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a> and twice many which have been edited each day. Should I just give then an RSS firehose they regex through? I suppose I should think about it and plan: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="h0p3's%2520Wiki%2520Updates%2520%2526%2520Notifications.html">h0p3's Wiki Updates &amp; Notifications</a>.</p><p>Once again, thank you for taking the time to speak with me about this. On a side note, I was wondering if you had any wikis (of yours or others) which I can or should learn from. I can't say I'm the best learner, but I will give it my best effort.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a></p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">r : </span> I will pick up every thread you lay down, root user. Please, don't feel obligated to do the same with me. You do you, boo boo.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">p : </span> It might even border on worries of a private language.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">c : </span> They've been working on their wikis for a year or so. This is one of the primary avenues through which they generate evidence of their growth.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">e : </span> Well, at least on the empirical end. There are some other good worries I can't resolve.</sub></p></div>
