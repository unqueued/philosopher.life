<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The dirtier part of my mind hopes for some rule34 action.</p><p>Yeah, I think I really only care about the overtly philosophical aspect of the book. The narrative wrapped around it isn't so great. Maybe it's because I'm an old fart or something.</p><p>I appreciate the glossing over of science, physics in particular. It's a non-trivial problem.</p><p>The menstruation and motherhood reveal is odd. </p><p>I need my children to read this book.</p><p>The smackdown on Berkeley is fucking hilarious!</p><p>I adore the Kant section.</p><hr><h2 class="">For my notes:</h2><p>Hegel criticized the Romantics for having the wrong kind of &quot;world spirit.&quot; The world spirit Hegel has in mind is every word spoken by every human (Dasein is better here). There exists a kind of unattainable truth. All knowledge is human knowledge. Hegel has a method for understanding the progress of history. It teaches us how to think productively. The other methods sought the eternal criteria of how to think. The basis of human cognition changes from one generation to the next, according to Hegel. There is no universal that ties them all, on his view. The only fixed point is history itself. </p><p>History has the causal flow, and the history of reason/thought, are washed along like a river and help to determine what happens downstream. The thought may be correct from where you stand. As regards philosophical reflections, reason is dynamic...there is no objective standpoint from Hegel's point of view? Human knowledge is constantly expanding and progressing. The world spirit has progressed; there is more water in the river. The world spirit is expanding towards knowledge of itself. History is the story of the world spirit gradually coming to consciousness of itself. </p><p>How can he have uncovered law's of the spirit without turning to something external to him? He clearly is seeking the ideal. </p><p>Hegel's theory is a Memetic Survival of the Fittest position. This can be described in evolutionary psychology. The &quot;is/ought&quot; problem arises very quickly. He does not give us any underlying ideal, and if he wants to say it makes sense, I think he must take up the faith of an external standard.</p><p>We are children of our time. </p><p>Something &quot;Becoming&quot; both &quot;is&quot; and &quot;is not.&quot; It resolves a problem of being and non-being. A description of reality is constantly filled with opposites (concept dialectics require it). </p><p>Individuals are an organic part of the world spirit at large. Reason manifests itself in language. It is the language which forms the individual, that is how the individual is expressed. </p><p>Hegel didn't like those who were part of the state. I agree to The Stack. The state is more thant he sum of its citizens, and you cannot resign from society. It is not the individual that finds itself, it is the world spirit. The spirit returns to itself in 3 stage:</p><ol><li>Conscious of itself in the individual (subjective spirit)</li><li>interaction between people (objective spirit)</li><li>Self-realization in absolute spirit, part religion and philosophy, the highest form of knowledge, reflects on its own impact on history. Philosophy is the mirror of the world spirit.</li></ol><p>Pantheism, one big ego, Romanticism (but also Hegel, Romanticism done well). </p><p>Kierkegaard, truth for me. Aims to destroy Hegel's lack of individual responsibility and context. </p><hr><h2 class="">Back to the book:</h2></div>
