2 HR AGO
Yup. They are off playing in the bell choir for two services today, but it's good otherwise. We're doing our schoolwork, playing magic for math, etc.
2 HR AGO
My wife is severing a church tonight and kiddo is going to play and see the service. I have opted out. Went to church yesturday but just kept falling asleep during the sermon.
2 HR AGO
I'm gonna take the few hours at home alone to wrap some gifts and relax without noise.
2 HR AGO
I have the opposite reaction in church. It's like PTSD. I hate every human in the building when I stand in it.
2 HR AGO
I have spent a great deal of my life in church, of course.
2 HR AGO
I prefer my desk. =)
2 HR AGO
But the girls put on all their make up and the mini skirts.
2 HR AGO
Porn is better.
2 HR AGO
(although, both my girls did their makeup today, and that is a fine thing ;P)
2 HR AGO
Lol. My wife is a bigger girl. And doesn't bother me a bit. But some of those skinny girls. Just use church to show off their outfits. Guys the same way. Wearing their name brand north face vest blah.

I agree we conceptually cannot escape virtue-signaling to ourselves or some ideal judge/standard; I think most people are lack introspection about it (they are not rigorous in their reasoning).
1 HR AGO
Do you think your picture is a virtue-signal? =)
1 HR AGO
It's a nice desk.
1 HR AGO
You make me think to much. I have to re read what you wrote and then try to make it make sense.
1 HR AGO
I appreciate every ounce of effort you spend!
1 HR AGO
Indeed. I dunno if I woukd call. It virtue signaling. A laymen term would. Be showing off their success, attire, thee attempts at impressing people.
1 HR AGO
I am very guilty of this, especially with automobiles and showing off my toys, tools, and skill.
1 HR AGO
If anything, what should we virtue-signal and why?
1 HR AGO
I suppose my judgment is hipocritical.
1 HR AGO
Virtue signal love and desire to serve other. Is what you probabaly would say?
1 HR AGO
I am not sure I can reduce it nicely.
1 HR AGO
But when I Walk in the bank to get a loan. I'm virtue signaling moneymaking cause I want a lower apr on my loan. Hahaha
1 HR AGO
Indeed.
1 HR AGO
Ruduce it nicely?
1 HR AGO
You have full access to be honest and blunt.
1 HR AGO
I am not sure I can give you a short and sweet articulation of the morality behind virtue-signaling. You offered what I would probably say; I don't know how to say it all in a neat package (I meant nice as neatness here).
1 HR AGO
I see.
1 HR AGO
Your bank example is a fantastic one.
1 HR AGO
virtue-signaling can be on purpose and sometimes it's not on purpose (at least not directly). Insofar as we have direct or indirect control over this signaling, it is a moral question (something we are morally responsible for).
1 HR AGO
Sometimes we must lie, deceive, misdirect, and play games of imperfect information.
1 HR AGO
Your. Mind works too . Hard.
1 HR AGO
I've taught my daughter to wear makeup directly because the lizard-brained limbic systems which evolutionarily evolved to seek the shiny symmetries on our faces are a bias that most people never even attempt to overcome. They do not treat the dignity of her personhood with respect. Thus, she is morally permitted to deceive (in many cases, even obligated).
1 HR AGO
Moral life is very hard.
1 HR AGO
Wisdom requires a great deal of thought.
1 HR AGO
It is a moral question. But in face value it is just a decision of showing off or not. I cannot imagine anyone thinks much beyond that.
1 HR AGO
I have taken great strides to tell. My daughter the opposite. That she does not need makeup to be pretty and I control when she gets to wear makeup out in public.
1 HR AGO
Why do you think that is the opposite?
1 HR AGO
https://philosopher.life/#2017.06.22%20-%20Prompted%20Introspection%20Log:%5B%5B2017.06.22%20-%20Prompted%20Introspection%20Log%5D%5D
1 HR AGO
It is a self confidence thing. Many family and friends telling her how beautiful she looks playing dress up and using makeup as a small kid. &quot;oh, my, Samantha, you look so beautiful.&quot; She developed a direct association with makeup. And lipstick  and did. Not feel pretty without it.
1 HR AGO
I'm telling her that outer beauty isn't relevant to what makes her intrinsically valuable. Looking pretty is only instrumentally valuable; it makes it so people enjoy looking at you.
1 HR AGO
I had to go so far as to tell all family and friends they were not allowed to buy her makeup.
1 HR AGO
I think we are both right. It is dependent on how the child responds.
1 HR AGO
Why does it depend on how the child responds?
1 HR AGO
My argument seems sound regardless of how she responds.
1 HR AGO
I actually think I've taken the spirit of the claim you are pointing to and fleshed it out.
1 HR AGO
If my daughter is crying in the bathroom at 6 years old cause daddy said she can't wear lipstick. She thinks she is not not pretty without lipstick. I think giving into societies expectation on beauty and makeup is just steps away from botox and nose jobs.
1 HR AGO
If you cannot feel comfortable. And love yourself without makeup. You never will with makeup
1 HR AGO
I have given you the formal reasoning which backups up that beautiful informal claim.
1 HR AGO
I'm not sure I agree with controlling when she can wear makeup, but I very much appreciate that you do not want your daughter to value herself in terms of how others value her appearance.
1 HR AGO
The source of our value as persons does not rest upon our ability to be useful to others.
1 HR AGO
Right. But if I tell. My child it's only because &quot;it makes it so people enjoy looking at you.&quot; the the opposite must be true that people do. Not enjoy looking at her without. Makeup. Despite my attempts at explaining her value is not. Beauty but what's inside.
1 HR AGO
My 8 year old. Is. Not ready to. Understand that concept.
1 HR AGO
They do not enjoy looking at her as much*
1 HR AGO
I hear that. Virtue requires habituation, training, etc. She will iteratively grow her conception of the issues.
1 HR AGO
I suggest neither of us can give full accounts of this issue either. As I said: I cannot nicely reduce this to a single sentence for you (not even for myself).
1 HR AGO
The source of our value as persons does not rest upon our ability to be useful to others.
1 HR AGO
Moving on. But what dies this mean.
1 HR AGO
Does*
1 HR AGO
=) That sentence is much closer than all the others to the answer. I am glad you picked it out.
1 HR AGO
Why should we respect others? Why do have moral obligations to others at all, and how do we know what we owe others?
1 HR AGO
My mind has difficulty appriciating a useless human beside those that are developmental impaired, old, sick, or handicapped.
1 HR AGO
I can appreciate that.
1 HR AGO
Or a child. A child has a place but not a significant use yet.
1 HR AGO
Some things are only valuable in virtue of being means to some other ends.
1 HR AGO
Some things, however, are intrinsically valuable (rather than instrumentally valuable) because they are valuable even if they are not a means to another end.
1 HR AGO
That is to say, intrinsically value is an end in itself.
1 HR AGO
I suggest that persons have an innate intrinsic value. I will also submit a claim which is very unpopular among some folks: I think some people are more valuable than others, though I am convinced everyone has a minimal value high enough that it generates significant obligations to them.
1 HR AGO
This is what Jesus is telling you in the NT (and I can trace it back to the OT if you need).
1 HR AGO
That Second Greatest commandment is no joke.
1 HR AGO
I suppose. It is the capitolism That has made me monetized value on human skill. And therfore makes me feel. More humans are more valuable than others. I would agree that all humans have a value but I admit some. More than others.
1 HR AGO
Aye. It turns out that capitalism commodifies everything, but it is not an objective (or even a fair intersubjective) measurement of value. Capitalism's evaluations are a function of power not truth. Indeed, it isn't capable of defining intrinsic value.
1 HR AGO
Google. Intrinsic value and most of what you see is related to company stocks.
1 HR AGO
BTW.
1 HR AGO
Not something I. Could research quickly.
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
You are lucky to know an expert.
1 HR AGO
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-intrinsic-extrinsic/
1 HR AGO
That is a fantastic introduction.
1 HR AGO
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value shows the disambiguation to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value
1 HR AGO
I do think you could find it, though not as quickly as you'd like.
1 HR AGO
It is also likely that Google shapes a filter bubble for you that is more economically shaped than ethically based upon a pattern of searches or uses of the web as they track you.
1 HR AGO
I have to read and think more about it. I am not studied on it. And therfore cannot speak About it without insulting your intellect.
1 HR AGO
Indeed. It would. And woukd. Make. More sense for the algorithm of. Google. To. Do. That.
1 HR AGO
At glance I don't disagree with humans intrinsic value as being non useful. But no. Less valuable even in a capitolists perspective.
1 HR AGO
I. Don't. Like. To. Place. Myself. In that light. But I suppose it is how I often feel.
1 HR AGO
Moral value is the only value that matters in itself. Goodwill is like a priceless jewel. All other values are dependent upon it in our reasoning. Even markets only have merit in terms of how they serve The Moral Law.
1 HR AGO
You make me think too much sir. I am. Not that intelligent. I can easily remeber info for Short periods. But I am No philosopher! Lol
1 HR AGO
I am still coming to understand it myself. There's no way you're going to understand all the implications of what I'm saying here in a single shot (and, I'm flawed, finite, and fallible too). We will continue to think about it together. It is at the heart of the matter for us.
1 HR AGO
Agreed. And it. Is. Now time. For. Me. To wrap. Some. Gifts!
1 HR AGO
Have fun! =)
1 HR AGO
I will! You all. Have fun too!</code></pre></div>
