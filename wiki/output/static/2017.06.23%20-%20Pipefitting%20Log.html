<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today's day was longer than usual. I studied for an easy test and nailed it. I have two more tests left in this book. There is only one more book left if we do it. </p><p>Oh, I also helped catch baby ducklings stuck in a very dense thicket/garden of flowers that is walled off in the center of campus. There were several of us working on it. I told empathy and evolution stories to these people of the duckling in this context. Great place to hatch them, except that they couldn't escape. I rarely touch animals except for my cats, especially not of my own volition. It was cute though, and it needed my rescuing. I found the duckling's mom and placed her carefully nearby. The duckling ran to her mom. It was sweet. Furthermore, I believe it endeared me to the staff and admin on campus. I had three people thank me. </p><p>While the teacher was busy, I grabbed a bunch of tools and supplies for next week. Just in case he doesn't show up, I'll have the stuff to work with. It is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission. In a way, when confronted with the liability, responsibility, or possibilities of effort, people are too likely to say no. If they deal with it after the fact, especially if they already like you to some extent, they will be charitable enough to brush it off and think you did what you had to do.</p><p>After school, I went to visit the union. I'm putting my time in. Randy knew my name today. They were working on a neat beveling device, trying to get it working. There were two apprentices with him today practicing. One was an ex-marine who came in as a 4th-year apprentice, a welder. He was practicing TIG. He was okay but didn't belong in the same league as the star pupil of Dale in the TCAT program. The other guy looked like a redneck Cypher from The Matrix (similar personality characteristics too). He joined 6 months ago as a welder. I think he came in as a 3rd-year apprentice. </p><p>Both guys said not to mention the technical school to anyone since it would be held against me. I think that's funny, since I'm very convinced, at least for welding, that the technical school welders, on average, were miles better than these guys were. I watched and talked with both. </p><p>The second guy, Jeremy, was going to show me the ropes of welding. He asked if I could try, but Randy said no to him (while I was gone getting my stuff). He said he'd let me anyway, and to just hand him the welding torch if anyone came by. He talked a lot. </p><p>He said being an apprentice sucks, but the pay is great. He said our union was filled with really good people though. They've helped him out in tight spots and were there for him in difficult social situations. That's good to hear. He also said it is easier to find work as a welder than a fitter, especially if you've studied all the different types/kinds and are certified for it. His claim was that all welders can fit, but after seeing his explanation of the table he created, I'm not so sure he would be able to just whip out serious pipefitting from isometric to spool, nor the rigging and mounting that comes after. He definitely has some shit-talking in him.</p><p>He showed me how to drop stringers and explained his thought process. He had some good points. I then showed him what I was made of. The crust flaked right off, and my gorgeous bead stunned him. He said it was perfect, that they were better than his, and he obviously had nothing to teach me. Said he would kill to weld like that. Mind you, I did give him my absolute best, in my best position, using a temp higher than I normally would. </p><p>He told me to learn to drop roots, practicing just that. He says my hotpasses, fillers, and caps would be amazing if they are anything like my stringer. He's right. Once I master the root, I'll have everything I need to pass the certifications for welding structural plate, imho. In fact, he said if he were me, where I'm at, I should just skip straight to pipe. I really suck at pipe. But, if I could stick weld pipe, I would be in great shape.</p><p>He gave me some parts to practice the walk-the-cup motion on TIG. </p><p>I'm thinking I'll follow my teacher's advice here; maybe I should just weld next week. Although, I need to pass those tests too. I think building a connection alignment pin would be worthwhile. Practicing my roots is really key. So much to do, so little time!</p><p>If I can pass the stick welding tests for both plate and pipe, I will dramatically increase the jobs available to me. I'm not sure how to broach the subject with my pipefitting teacher, nor how to convince AB&amp;T to buy a welding machine for me. </p><p>It's difficult to see the correct direction to take! I have many options. I would be excellent at all of them. Again, the union looks like a great place to continue learning all the trades.</p></div>
