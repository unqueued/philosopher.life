<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Okrent distinguishes merely having goals from intentionality in chapter 5. He differentiates the Sphex wasp from humans on the grounds that one must have reasons and adaptive flexibility to novel circumstances to be said to possess intentionality.</p><p>Let me first say that Okrent and I have starkly different views about where we should employ the word ‘goal’. I oppose the attribution of goals to non-rational, non-moral agents. I don’t think we can conceive of a ‘goal’ outside of moral normativity and reason. I’d like to think goals are always intentional, and Okrent clearly doesn’t. I will try to use ‘goal’ as Okrent does, for the purposes of this paper.</p><p>Okrent maintains some differentiationist aspects to his theory of intentionality (which with I can agree, and may even go beyond what he points out). While I think an account of differentiation is due to both freewill and rationality, Okrent clearly thinks it is singularly rationality which demarcates intentional life forms from those which aren’t. The Sphex wasp does not possess intentionality for Okrent. Its biological behavior is goal-directed, but it lacks any rational explanation. What becomes unclear is why ‘goal-directed’ thinking is really all that essential to his theory. If one can have ‘goals’ outside of reason, beliefs, and desires, and goals aren’t the distinguishing factor, then what is so essential about goals? It seems as if the possession of reason, beliefs, and desires are the important part to his theory.</p><p>Aspects of his differentiation are demonstrated by his fleshing out the meanings and roles of reason, belief, and desire within his account of intentionality. The root of intentionality, as we will see, is the novelty and appropriateness of action (to the goal, I suspect) within varying and novel circumstances which justifies the attribution of rationality to an entity. As Okrent puts it:</p><p>Rational action essentially involves versatile adaptive behavior that varies in response to changing circumstances, responds effectively to the source of the agent’s mistakes, and is novel in relation to the agent’s species-specific pattern of life.1</p><p>Successful “transient intentional states”2 demonstrate ‘instrumental rationality’. Importantly, Okrent believes you can only be rational with beliefs and desires.3 Additionally, in assessing Dennett’s account, Okrent points out the difference between “entities that have ends of their own” and “[entities] which one may assign purposes extrinsically.”4</p><p>This might be the hierarchy of what is occurring in a single instance of intentionality:</p><p>Desire – ‘I want to buy a book today’.</p><p>Beliefs (what I take the world to be) – ‘It is feasible for me to travel to stores, including Barnes &amp; Noble’, ‘I can choose and pay for books at Barnes &amp; Noble’, ‘Barnes &amp; Noble is open from 8am to 10pm’, ‘A book at Barnes &amp; Noble will cost, at the minimum, 10 dollars’, ‘</p><p>Reason/Rationally generated Belief – ‘If I travel to Barnes &amp; Noble, between hours 8am and 10pm’, with 10 or more dollars, then I can buy a book’.</p><p>Intentional End-Goal – ‘I will buy a book today’.</p><p>Sub-Goals (obviously simplified, as there are sub-goals to sub-goals):</p><p>‘I will have 10 or more dollars on my person’</p><p>‘I will travel to Barnes &amp; Nobles’</p><p>‘I will arrive between 8am and 10pm’</p><p>‘I will choose a book, bring it to the counter, and pay for it’.</p><p>The End-Goal corresponds to desire, but it requires rationality to arrive at the intentional state. Sub-Goals correspond to beliefs.</p><p>Notice that that while this is instrumental rationality, the only way to prove that I’m rational, that I possess desires/beliefs, and essentially that I demonstrate intentionality, would be to test me with novel circumstances to see if I have adaptive flexibility of sub-goals. Otherwise, it could be merely an illusion that I’m rational (the alien field teleologist might be xenopomorphizing attributes of rationality onto me, etc.)</p><p>So, let’s say one of my beliefs wasn’t accurate enough - perhaps Barnes &amp; Noble isn’t open on Christmas day (something of which I wasn’t aware at the time), and today is Christmas day. When I arrive at Barnes &amp; Noble, I quickly discover that I can’t buy a book because they are closed. My beliefs about the world adjust; in this case, my belief about the times/dates that Barnes &amp; Noble is open is qualified. My desire and end-goal remain the same. I may need to employ other beliefs and new reasoning to find a new path of sub-goals to my end-goal. Perhaps I know I can also buy books online at Amazon.com. A new series of sub-goals will be reasoned and intended to bring about the end-goal. This is adaptive reasoning; this is instrumental rationality; this is novel action for novel circumstances; this is the basis of Okrent’s intentionality.</p><p>If I’m right about Okrent’s account, the multi-dimensional and extremely nested aspect of sub-goals leads us to question whether or not our so called ‘end-goal’ isn’t itself also just a sub-goal to a larger end-goal. If this sort of reasoning follows, we might deduce a final, axiomatic ‘End-goal’ (or set of them). Perhaps I’m buying a book about how to raise my children. Perhaps raising my children well is a higher goal. Perhaps even raising my children well is a sub-goal to a higher goal, etc. It is a network of holistic reasoning, desires, and beliefs which enable a pyramid of goal-directed intentionality.</p><p>Lastly, I can’t help but wonder: Can you intend something without action? Deontologists and Virtue ethicists would certainly think so. Okrent, as a pragmatist, would seem to deny it.</p><p>1 Mark Okrent. Rational Animals: The Teleological Roots of Intentionality.
