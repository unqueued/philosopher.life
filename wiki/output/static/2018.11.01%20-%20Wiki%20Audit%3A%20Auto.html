<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I still am not happy with the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Autogen.html">Autogen</a> approach. I want fine-grained, detailed control of where objects go, in what order, but I also want to click a button and everything goes to sane default locations. Have and eat it too.</p><p>Now that I'm going the tag based link list route, it's even easier to spin up a thousand tiddlers.</p><hr><p>Added <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Monthly%2520Auditable.html">Monthly Auditable</a> because I want a one-stop shop.</p><hr><p>I switched naming on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="titletag.html">titletag</a>s due to actual tag usage. I don't like that I've lost this complexity and naming, but I think it's the price I'm going to have to pay for now. =( Ugh. You know, if I find this wasn't worth it, I can always just delete the tags quite easily. I can always move back to doing it by hand. I will get used to my power tools.</p><hr><p>Dream for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Wiki%2520Audit.html">Wiki Audit</a>:</p><ul><li>A tool which highlights linkable words or phases in the body of a tiddler, click-activated for formatting as link.</li></ul><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.11.01%2520-%2520Self-Dialectic%253A%2520%252Fb%252F%2520Contra.html">2018.11.01 - Self-Dialectic: /b/ Contra</a> demonstrates to me that I don't have an effective enough method for searching (unless I'm going to bruteforce) for a tiddler which speaks to the relationships between <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a> and {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}. Basically, I think I may have asked some version of this before, but I don't know how to quickly find it. This is a serious kind of problem worth solving on this wiki. I need to become a fucking grandmaster of searching this thing (not just categorizing and linking it together). </p><p>It needs to be more than &quot;contains: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a> + {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}.&quot; That's way too fucking broad. They actually need to be in close proximity. The Context-based search is close to what I'm talking about here. This seems to be a generalized kind of query that I can improve upon and make as a consistently functioning tool, right?</p><hr><p>I'm arguing with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="j3d1h.html">j3d1h</a> about whether or not we should move to another kind of hosting here. Because we serve a single static index.html file, we really don't have to host it ourselves. The work seems largely irrelevant, and I'm not paying more than a buck a month for hosting this. We're going to try hosting it on <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://m6ram.github.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://m6ram.github.io</a>.</p><hr><p>It ended up being a lot easier than I thought it would be. Set ATL to <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://live.philosopher.life" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://live.philosopher.life</a>. It appears the load times are significantly improved. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="m10%253A%2520h0p3's%2520crontab.html">m10: h0p3's crontab</a> now set for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="wiki-live-git.sh.html">wiki-live-git.sh</a> minutely (no room to make mistakes now, lol). At this point, I have little reason not to include the signature within the wiki itself.</p><p>I can't say it's radically faster. I could setup Watch for faster realtime, but a minute is fine with me. </p><p>It shaves off .5s for my desktop, and about 8s(!) for my phone. That's not nothing. There's still improvements that could be made, but not much more. I think the splash screen (<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://tiddlywiki.com/prerelease/#Creating%20a%20splash%20screen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://tiddlywiki.com/prerelease/#Creating%20a%20splash%20screen</a>) may actually work, but I don't understand if gzip really enables that. I'm going to find out, eh? =)...Currently 22MB down to 7.7MB. That's still ridiculously fucking big. ZSTD appears strictly better in my usecase, but I'm also not qualified to say that either. This</p><p>Now, I'm in charge of the backup, and someone else is in charge of the primary. That's fine with me, haha. </p><p>The throughput difference is evident. And, the bandwidth limit is essentially limitless. It's free hosting that I can push a diff to minutely.</p><hr><p>This little jig, <code>&lt;&lt;list-links &quot;[tag[FoobarTag]prefix[2018.10]]&quot;&gt;&gt;</code> is all I need for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Monthly%2520Auditable.html">Monthly Auditable</a>. It does the trick. </p><p>This is yet another strike against the need for hardcoding so much.</p><hr><p>Drunken spree on ASCII and Unicode all up in this bitch. I adore the changes to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-shadow tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%2524%253A%252Flanguage%252FRecentChanges%252FDateFormat.html">$:/language/RecentChanges/DateFormat</a> ROFL!</p></div>
