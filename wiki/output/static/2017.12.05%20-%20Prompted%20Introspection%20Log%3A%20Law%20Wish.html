<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">I wish there were a law that said?.. This would be a good law because?.</h2><p>My Red Woman, you really do love me, don't you? Rub your wish-questions on me. As usual, since I know you are wet with anticipation for my initial response, I must tell how I would wish for infinite wishes. In this case, conjunctions would allow me to agglomerate an enormously large molecular &quot;law&quot; containing all the laws I want to be legislated. </p><p>Alright, so now I need to understand what it means to not be cheaty-faced about this question. Unfortunately, I think almost any significant law is actually logically molecular, but some are simply larger and more complex than others. I am going to interpret your question, in this case, as seeking a particular principle. Of course, I run the risk of truisms like: &quot;maximize the minimum&quot; or &quot;decentralize power&quot; or &quot;structure society such that workers own the means of production&quot; or even &quot;do what is morally right.&quot; These laws simply require us to answer even more questions (which isn't a bad thing, but it makes them poor laws). I suppose, then, that a principle here must be a kind of complete-ish maxim, containing the instructions of the instrumental means to the end, as well as the motivational component for that end. I will give you a well-crafted practical maxim, my dear.</p><p>Before I can do that, however, now I must ask more questions. &quot;Good law&quot; by what standard, or good for whom? Let us sit behind the Veil of Ignorance in the pseudo-solipsistic Original Position engaged in an eternal Metamodern Reflective Equilibrium dialectic for defining <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a>. Oh, I don't have time for that in this space. I must be practical. Let's assume my opinion of what counts as good law for now then. </p><p>Further, is the law one that is obeyed, by whom, to what extent, and for what reasons? How normatively will the law be treated, enforced, adjudicated? Am I able to re-write the fundamental criterion of authority, the basis of the government's power? For what government am I writing the law? What's the scale of it; I'd say very different answers for local, state, national, international, etc. I do not even know, ultimately, how to define law in this case. Will you allow me space to just use my best judgment? Let us say you do.</p><p>I like Lessig's Campaign Finance Reform a lot. But, I don't think it will solve the problem still. I think enforcing net neutrality is critical, but I don't know how to state it well. I think requiring deep investments in infrastructure, free education, maximizing opportunities for the poor, preventing nationalism, and taxing multi-nationals and our overlords are critically valuable. I do not know how to state that cleanly for you though. It's too complex to go here, my love.</p><p>Ugh, this is a hard question to answer. Oh my <em>Statesman</em>, where are you?</p></div>
