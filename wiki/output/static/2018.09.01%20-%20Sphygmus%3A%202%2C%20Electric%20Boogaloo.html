I assumed (!) that I'd remember what password I used, and didn't set a recovery email. sheesh. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson when I lost some very meaningful photos in a mega.nz account that I didn't write down the master key for...</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3.html">h0p3</a>,</p><p>I pasted your letter into my wiki<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">WK</sup></button> and none of the footnotes worked - and then I realized I included TWCode in my first letter without remembering it was my personal code.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">D</sup></button> Having come to this realization, I will be sure to change it before emailing it to you. It is interesting to share a medium that has the same roots, but different branches. We've each made comfortable wiki homes for ourselves, molded in different ways.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">cf</sup></button> I am curious what other interactions of wiki code will come up over time.</p><p>The poetry in &quot;sphygmus&quot; is subsequent to the choice of the word. I had been thinking about how to become visible since I read <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2018.08.23%2520-%2520kickscondor%253A%2520Hyperconversations.html">2018.08.23 - kickscondor: Hyperconversations</a>. I felt called out for not participating in the compact of transparency with you both, and that I needed to acknowledge (thank you.) your influence on the construction of my wiki home. I didn't know what to say<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">c</sup></button> or in what form to say it, and I had to figure out what privacy I wanted and how to implement it. Toward that end, I wanted a pseudonym that would also work as a domain name, separate from the couple I already have.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">URL</sup></button> The .us domain is absurdly cheap on Namecheap right now, and I am drawn to domain names that integrate the TLD into a word; I looked through <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wordfind.com/ends-with/us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a list of words ending in -us</a> and a lot of the words I thought were cool are already (predictably) taken - sphygm.us<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">dx</sup></button> was not. Somehow the word domain holders missed that one!</p><p>It's been...five or six years? since my class with Lisa Ruddick. I recognized her as my former professor through the article by her references to DW Winnicott and Christopher Bolas - the class was about interpreting literature through the lenses of various psychological theories, and we read several works by those theorists. Much of her article went over my head (I'm not embedded in the critical English milieu) but the sense I got from it of the field makes me glad I didn't pursue English further. I'd rather build up our senses of self, rather than tear them away.</p><p>My major went from &quot;interdisciplinary studies&quot; to &quot;visual arts major philosophy minor&quot; to &quot;visual arts major&quot; over the course of my time in Chicago. It's a complicated story<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">s</sup></button>, but I left and went back home with three classes to go before graduating. I'm just this semester taking classes at a different university to transfer back to uChicago to complete my degree.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Antipleonasmic%2520Catholicon.html">That</a> is a directory I haven't explored yet! I shall investigate further. (I have no ideas for a title; just an observation that <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the butterfly effect</a> is linked to our interconnectivity in my mind.)</p><blockquote><p>Who are your mentors, idols, and people who shape you the most? What is most salient to you? Where do you hope to go in the desert, and why, nomad?</p></blockquote><p>I will ruminate on these questions! I want to be sensitive in regards to length (walls of text can be hard to digest) and I think it will be better for answers to develop individually. I'm trying to figure out the balance of dialogue and topicality and exposition here. The process of getting to know someone through the medium of letters seems very different from that of becoming absorbed in personal writings.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pal</sup></button></p><p>Speaking of personal writings, the impenetrability of your top level directories lay in the compounding of personal and specialized vocabulary<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">lg</sup></button> that I didn't/don't fluently understand (salience, qualia, telos, sublator, contextualist, relativist, lexical, Bayesian, etc). I found my way through being curious about how you are actually working with the wiki every day. I've read a lot of the pages in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a>, and explored your higher level pages through them.</p><p>It is significant to me that you described my letter as kind; thank you.</p><p>deeply, s.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">WK : </span> I've only been using it for roughly three weeks now. I'm still very much in the infancy of molding it to my needs, and discovering what those needs are through using it.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">D : </span> I was immensely frustrated by the plugin's design choice to implement two different kinds of footnote pop-ups called by essentially the exact same word, so I changed it. That level of customization is one of the really lovely things about TWiki for me.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">cf : </span> I'm suggesting that you've made the <em>place</em> of your wiki comfortable, fitting the font and the scale to match your screen, however uncomfortable the content may or may not be to wrestle with.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">c : </span> (not that I have any more of a clue now)</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">URL : </span> One of the things I'm thinking about is the idea of a 'portfolio website' and how, as someone sideways stepping towards the label 'artist', I want to approach it. I despise the 'johnsmith.com' trend - it doesn't feel right for me - and yet I want any domain I choose for the purpose to be meaningful or embedded with myself. I've found a solution that fits nicely in large part because it does hold pieces of IRL me. At some point I might feel comfortable working from that domain at large, but I'm not there yet.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">dx : </span> It is also being used as a user name by several other people online, which helps obfuscate any pinpointing attempts.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">s : </span> I'm not averse to sharing - the shift in myself from the time I left until now has been in large part due to accepting and being honest about this experience - but it probably deserves its own letter. My thoughts on occupation, current and future, will also make up an entirely different piece!</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">pal : </span> My best childhood friend was a pen pal and even then to some extent I thought about conversational give and take. I had a formula - a greeting, some paragraph wishing them well, a chatty body section with what I wanted to say, then several closing paragraphs addressing particulars from their letter - and those closing paragraphs were essential to making the connection. I think we are pointing to similar things when you say 'I aim to demonstrate what you say matters to me.'</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">lg : </span> lg ‚Ü£ language! wk ‚Ü£ wiki, d ‚Ü£ design, cf ‚Ü£ comfort, c ‚Ü£ clue, url ‚Ü£ url, dx ‚Ü£ dox, s ‚Ü£ sharing/shift, pal ‚Ü£ penpal</sub></p></div>
