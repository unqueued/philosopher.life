5 HR AGO
I have to finish my homework I started. You?
5 HR AGO
Writing my ass off, as usual. Putting a lot of thought into how I'm constructing the extended cover letter to the EFF.
5 HR AGO
I am so happy you are doing cybersecurity. I hope we get to talk shop (I know I will have a lot to learn from you, if you are willing to teach me).
5 HR AGO
(don't let me bother you btw...I like that we can asynchronously message. I often leave messages knowing it will be a while before anyone can respond)
5 HR AGO
Haha, I hope I learn enough to be able to teach you something. I‚Äôm always down to talk, I don‚Äôt do a whole lot these days.
4 HR AGO
So you stay in touch with anyone else from our college days? T-Money* I know.
4 HR AGO
T-Money, Mick, Dustin and once every couple of years, Ryan
4 HR AGO
I'm sorry, I don't know who Mick is. My memory is not what it used to be.
4 HR AGO
It is in steep decline, imho.
4 HR AGO
Who's Mick?
4 HR AGO
You might not have met him. He was two years behind me and he was my roommate after Jared
4 HR AGO
Ah!
4 HR AGO
Okay, cool.
4 HR AGO
How's Dustin and Ryan doing?
4 HR AGO
What do you think of your gang these many years later?
4 HR AGO
Of all of us Dustin had his shit together the most. Life have been good for him. He‚Äôs got a good career, girl number two is coming within the month, and they just bought a new house north of Cinci.
4 HR AGO
Ryan married some older South American lady he met on the cruise ships were he worked and they have a daughter together.
4 HR AGO
I like the gang, wish we hung out more
4 HR AGO
I am not shocked to hear either of those, lol.
4 HR AGO
Right? He and Natalee have steadily climbed the ranks with their careers.
4 HR AGO
Not sure about Ryan, last I saw he was working at a hotel
4 HR AGO
I am not sure I would be a valuable contributor to Ryan and Dustin's lives. Probably not worth the hangout from what I can tell, though I don't know for sure.
4 HR AGO
Admittedly, you and T-Money were the most philosophical of the bunch.
4 HR AGO
Got a letter from Brandon Love long ago. Apparently he had been hunting for me; he went into philosophy instead of religion as well (he also became a Marxist and went the live in Asia too).
4 HR AGO
I looked him up a while back and saw what he looked like, it makes sense now that you say that. Wow, two of the most religious people I knew at college.
4 HR AGO
Oh, I'm still extremely religious.
4 HR AGO
No one writes 25MB of plaintext in 2 years without being a religious zealot.
4 HR AGO
Lol, that might be true.
4 HR AGO
So what does Mr BJ Love do for a career?
4 HR AGO
He's a philosopher.
4 HR AGO
Ok, let me rephrase that. How does he pay his bills?
4 HR AGO
By doing philosophy. People pay him to do it.
4 HR AGO
:shocked_face_with_exploding_head:
4 HR AGO
He's an academic.
4 HR AGO
There we go. Ok. It all makes sense now.   So, lost another Calvinist. I think last I talked to him he was in seminary and had converted to Arminian beliefs.
4 HR AGO
/fist-pump to Arminianism
4 HR AGO
I‚Äôm still a firm Calvinist.
4 HR AGO
I am shocked.
4 HR AGO
I tell you.
4 HR AGO
=) lol
4 HR AGO
Lol
4 HR AGO
That's cool. I've grown to appreciate it more than I used to.
4 HR AGO
Hey, not everyone can have the right beliefs. Some of us have to be wrong
4 HR AGO
That is the way reality is structured. I perceive it so clearly, so certainly. It cannot be an illusion.
4 HR AGO
It is immutably emedded in eidetic structure of my consciousness. Of course, I cannot see it otherwise.
4 HR AGO
As usual, you are right.
4 HR AGO
Alright,  you gotta tell me about the White Hammer, sir.
4 HR AGO
I am a man deeply invested in names.
4 HR AGO
I gotta know the story you tell yourself through that name.
4 HR AGO
Haha, it‚Äôs quite shallow actually. I was working one day and was talking to this black guy, he was talking about releasing the ‚Äúblack mamba.‚Äù So I asked him what the White equivalent was to black mamba and we went through a few different name combinations and settled on ‚Äúwhite hammer‚Äù
4 HR AGO
rofl
4 HR AGO
Of course, that is perfect.
4 HR AGO
So I threw in some 1337 speak and now you have it
4 HR AGO
:man-shrugging:
4 HR AGO
Well, it might be shallow, but it sounds huge to me.
4 HR AGO
What could be more e-penis-y than your l33t name. I adore it.
4 HR AGO
I just thought it was an awesome name. Especially because people shorten it to hammer. :ok_hand:
4 HR AGO
I did create a couple alt names as well for online stuff.
4 HR AGO
Eventually, we will just roll new hashes. The l33t will brute-sorce search for actual names in those Vanity hashes.
4 HR AGO
I'm q234097asdf09j231458ufdsa here, and 1432poijsfd09823q90qjsadf0 there.
4 HR AGO
My writing name (if I can ever bring myself to write anything) is a combination of ancestors names.
4 HR AGO
Geez man, that‚Äôs a name there.
4 HR AGO
`/squint`
4 HR AGO
Yeah, looks like it.
4 HR AGO
You will have to let me know your writing name when  you feel comfortable.
4 HR AGO
You‚Äôll be happy to know after my last failed relationship I‚Äôm put women to the back of my priorities for a while. I‚Äôm on my longest dry spell since forever and there‚Äôs no water in sight.
4 HR AGO
I am sorry to hear you are so thirsty in the desert, nomad. I can't help you with this one (lol) all my self. I will try to help you find the oasis when you feel you are ready to walk.
4 HR AGO
Ok well Jeremiah London is my online name for fb and shit. I created a fake profile to use some b/s/t forums and don‚Äôt have any friends on there. Calvin Turney Thompson is my pseudonym but when it‚Äôs placed on articles or anything it‚Äôll be shortened to CT Thompson
4 HR AGO
I don‚Äôt care, people will find them anyways.
4 HR AGO
Calvin is self explanatory, Turney and Thompson are former surnames from both sides of my family.
4 HR AGO
I love it. That's cool.
4 HR AGO
I value pseudonymity and anonymity in some crucial ways. I love that you can have a voice and choose your name. I think it is part of moral and political autonomy.
4 HR AGO
Of course, it's part of our online privacy.
3 HR AGO
Our freedom.
3 HR AGO
Sow what's your take on the &quot;right to be forgotten?&quot;
3 HR AGO
This is a complex topic. I'm not going to be able to effectively answer it without including a great deal from moral philosophy. The logic of speaking about &quot;rights,&quot; is something I spend a lot of time thinking about. I'm gonna give you many earfuls for a real answer. Let me TLDR it and say, I don't think we have a right to be forgotten, but we do have a right to be forgiven.
3 HR AGO
So, what does the right to be forgiven include?
3 HR AGO
Ah, you must show me your hand now first.
3 HR AGO
What's your take?
3 HR AGO
I think it's a from of censorship and that if you make it a strict law or human right or even a law to be interpreted by judges then it will be abused.  I could see a political leader or hopeful wishing to have some messy things in their past &quot;forgotten&quot; and then suing for a favorable settlement.
3 HR AGO
Preach.
3 HR AGO
Censorship and a way to basically rewrite history.
3 HR AGO
Re-write the data from which we generate models of history, yes.
3 HR AGO
Like net neutrality it sounds good on the outside but the more you dig into it the more you realize it has a vast potential to be abused.
3 HR AGO
Hrm. Mistaken.
3 HR AGO
Models of history based off of information is all we have.
3 HR AGO
Preach!
3 HR AGO
I so strongly agree to your claim. I cannot tell you how much.
2 HR AGO
Mistaken?
2 HR AGO
You do not know what NN really means, imho.
2 HR AGO
I will walk with you in the desert, sir.
2 HR AGO
lol
2 HR AGO
I will be able to point out very technically to you what it means.
2 HR AGO
From soup to nuts.
2 HR AGO
Inform me o wise one.
2 HR AGO
Lol! =)
2 HR AGO
Keep your nuts away from my soup.
2 HR AGO
Fair enough.
2 HR AGO
Let me say that building censorship-resistance is going to require a form of decentralization that centralized powers cannot control. The necessary conditions for such a network have strong cryptographic properties that ultimately treat others as themselves, as moral equals.
2 HR AGO
The more copies of a document out there the harder it will be to burn them or change them.
2 HR AGO
Net neutrality, insofar as it is concerned with the end-to-end principle, defeating Alice and MITM of all kinds, is the one of the results of an infrastructure (be it physical or virtualized over what we have) that is profoundly censorship resistant.
2 HR AGO
I agree to your copy claim! =)
2 HR AGO
It turns out to be more complicated than that, but that is part of it.
2 HR AGO
Your computer actually has to serve the computers of others.
2 HR AGO
Like torrenting?
2 HR AGO
Or blockchain sort of thing.
2 HR AGO
That is a quintessential case example of doing something right.
2 HR AGO
Blockchain not so much.
2 HR AGO
Blockchains are interested in forming a consensus, defeating sybil attacks through incentives models that ultimately cost too much to run for what you get.
2 HR AGO
My has that complaint with blockchain, that eventually the data will overwhelm the output we can generate.
2 HR AGO
my dad*
2 HR AGO
Seeding past 1 ratio, however, is extending beyond the eye for an eye (Tit For Tat, if you remember our micro class) and into a robust or anti-fragile Tit For Two Tats (when we decide we are not in perfect competition). It's one of the reasons it has been so successful in computing history.
2 HR AGO
Can you be more specific?
2 HR AGO
Torrenting thrives when people turn the other cheek and give more than they take.
2 HR AGO
Automating such behaviors is fundamental to networks which are memetically fit enough to thrive in the State of Nature.
2 HR AGO
I haven't read the same articles but basically he said that the amount of power it takes to verify blockchains is going to exceed what we're physically able to produce/
2 HR AGO
Ah yes, I've never understood those guys who have massive libraries seeding while I download.
2 HR AGO
There are some ways around it, but yes, it will always be price inefficient.
2 HR AGO
Ah, well, you don't understand a great many things. =)
2 HR AGO
Most the times unless it's a new file I delete the seed as soon as it downloads.
2 HR AGO
Yeah, that's definitely gotta happen sometimes.
2 HR AGO
I have hit and run many times.
2 HR AGO
Hit and run, yes I'm vaguely familiar with that. :)
2 HR AGO
It turns out that effectively building Libertarian networks must be done upon collectively using socialist instruments in which we all effectively individually own and share the means of productive
2 HR AGO
production*.
2 HR AGO
And what are these &quot;socialist instruments,&quot; pray tell?
2 HR AGO
Torrents communities are federalist attempts at it.
2 HR AGO
It's why I love your example.
2 HR AGO
I don't see them as socialist instruments at all, [[h0p3]].
2 HR AGO
Decentralizing power, including information power, is extremely socialist. It's one of the reasons I argue so vehemently against intellectual property rights.
2 HR AGO
I can see that. =)
2 HR AGO
They wouldn't be possible without capitalism, people don't produce for the good of others, but for themselves.
2 HR AGO
I agree that T4T gives rise to T42T in the material dialectic. Progress begins with the Ape evolving into a Human. It what makes the New Testament so fulfilling. Yes, the State of Nature begins, and we make progress with an eye-for-eye in perfectly competitive iterated prisoner's dilemmas. Nature must evolve that highly energy-efficient answer to the utilitarian game theory problem. But, it also gives may give rise to accepting turn-the-other-cheeck, Tit For Two Tats of forgiving retaliation, built upon cooperating with others in such a way that we treat them not as mere means but as ends in themselves, we treat them as ourselves with The Golden Rule, we openly have a faith in the other as not being a psychopath or pure egoist, but assume the wanderers in the desert may be angels among us who aren't playing in perfectly competitive games.
2 HR AGO
Yes, Marx in fact says it is impossible for Socialism to arise without Capitalism.
2 HR AGO
Socialism is a game-theoretically evolved response to capitalism.
2 HR AGO
https://ncase.me/trust/
2 HR AGO
Socialism is the step from capitalism to communism.  It's a rest stop on the journey.  It's not a destination, it's an exit on the highway.  There isn't some Socialist Utopia that we will get to when everyone is &quot;evolved&quot; enough to be compassionate and place the good of others before themselves.
2 HR AGO
I still don't believe in ape-human-evolution
2 HR AGO
I predict your prediction as well. Descriptions, however, are not prescription. That is called the Naturalistic Fallacy in some domains.
2 HR AGO
What does the Natural Fallacy have to do with it?
2 HR AGO
What I'm trying to tell you is that just because we predict something is going to happen doesn't mean we have a right to be evil. What &quot;is&quot; and what &quot;ought&quot; have crucial conceptual differences.
2 HR AGO
Who was saying we should be evil?
2 HR AGO
The is/ought distinction is important here. The &quot;ought&quot; is conceptually an axiom that regulations how to epistemically perceive what &quot;is.&quot;
2 HR AGO
I'm saying The Golden Rule is The Moral Law, and it's at the heart of what you say isn't going to happen. I get that. I agree, most people will just be evil, my prediction is catastrophic failures that may wipe out all or most of the human species as the great human pyramid collapses from the bottom-up as self-defeating and destructive result of the contradictions which arise from capitalism which makes no moral progress to the game-theoretic Tit for Tat.
2 HR AGO
Power continues to centralize, and decentralizing it is the only prescriptive answer (no matter how unlikely it is to occur).
2 HR AGO
I appreciate your willingness to wrestle and think with me, btw. I think it highly cooperative behavior.
2 HR AGO
What you're talking about harkens back to the OT and the Israelites.  God set them up to be tribal and to be ruled through local means, but they just couldn't handle it.  So they went to God and asked for rulers, He gave them judges.  They couldn't handle just having judges, so they asked Him again and he gave them Kings.  Yes, tribal decentralized power is the best choice, but ultimately people are stupid and have to be ruled, hence the slide into having kings.
2 HR AGO
It *ought* to be enough to have local tribal leaders to mediate for us but it *is not*
2 HR AGO
In fact, the only way to tax the wealthy, to make sure they aren't playing by a double-standard, where there is justice for us and the legal system for them, is make sure they are (and we all are) equally accountable to the Rule of Law. It turns out the morally justified legal positivist criterion of of a government is based upon a democracy that has decentralized power enough to make sure we rule ourselves.
2 HR AGO
I agree we need to be ruled. We must contruct our own laws. That is what autonomy means!
2 HR AGO
Only through decentralizing power effectively enough (because we live in an oligarchy, quite obviously) can we generate an effective Rule of Law.
2 HR AGO
And, I mean you no offense, but it is possibly you've missed several of my Biblical illustrations here.
2 HR AGO
(same old [[h0p3]] ;P)
2 HR AGO
Ah, but we do have an egalitarian system of law, it's just that with the corruption and class of elite that we have, it doesn't get enforced.  I agree that the law should apply equally to everyone, but I also believe to fix it we should take to more &quot;extreme&quot; means
2 HR AGO
Agreed we must go extreme.
2 HR AGO
If the people would start lynching these judges that aren't enforcing the law, then we wouldn't have this issue.
2 HR AGO
I have given you the game-theoretic answer. I would like for you to defeat it using game theory. I think my math is correct.
2 HR AGO
In order to make sure the wealthy are playing by the same set of rules then you apply the same rules to everyone.
2 HR AGO
Also, I agree violence is going to be necessary in almost all likelihood.
2 HR AGO
That is one place I have changed since we last talked.
2 HR AGO
A uniform tax rate with no loopholes or deductions.  A Justice System that is egalitarian *and* accountable for their actions.
2 HR AGO
How are you going to make sure it is enforced if we don't all control it?
2 HR AGO
We do all control it through the means of voting.
2 HR AGO
They only way to make sure capital doesn't corrupt a government is to have already distributed power.
2 HR AGO
Do you want to continue to hold that position?
2 HR AGO
Do you have any other argument?
2 HR AGO
I'll die on my hill [[h0p3]].
2 HR AGO
You very well may ;P
2 HR AGO
Just because some people have more resources than others doesn't mean that they took those resources from others unethically.
2 HR AGO
I don't think I've made an argument that denies the possibility of economic inequality. Why do you think that?
2 HR AGO
I will argue that resources have been distributed unethically, of course. They don't conceptually have to be, but I take it to be empirically the case for us.
2 HR AGO
But if I read correctly you're basically saying that &quot;we&quot; should have the means to seize property in order to enforce parity
2 HR AGO
I suggest our votes, btw, do not have any real influence on how Democrats and Republican parties have been wielded by those with money to run the government.
2 HR AGO
Should, yes...is that the primary method by which we come to own the means of production? Probably not. In some cases, we will have to seize it though.
2 HR AGO
I would agree with that.
2 HR AGO
To a point.
2 HR AGO
Oh, so you deny our votes have real power from a predictive, empirical point of view?
2 HR AGO
Look at how policies are shaped. What the vast majority of the voter base believes has nothing to do with odds that legislation will be passed, enforced, or adjudicated.
2 HR AGO
However, when you start looking at where power (and wealth) have centralized, you will find their views do alter what happens in politics.
2 HR AGO
I'm not saying that our system hasn't been corrupted, but I am denying that capitalism is to blame for it.
2 HR AGO
I might be wrong. Please show me.
2 HR AGO
lol
2 HR AGO
Oh [[h0p3]].  Still good ol [[h0p3]].
2 HR AGO
I'm giving you an explanation of how capital begeting capital centralizes power to the point that it has taken over our government.
2 HR AGO
Ok
2 HR AGO
As capitalism matures, it's clear to anyone with a thread of financial literacy that most wealth is created through capital gains rather than salary. We're approaching a state (at least in developed countries) where productivity is so high, that you can literally park your money in 500 of the biggest businesses and you're almost guaranteed a 7% annual return (if you hold stocks for the long term). Using the commonly accepted safe withdraw rate of 4%, if you inherit $3 million (which is not even that much), you can safely collect $120,000 of capital gains/dividend income every year without doing anything. This also frees you up to work on other things that will acquire you even more wealth. People whose parents didn't leave them a large inheritance have to rely on salary, which is taxed at a higher rate and more difficult to earn.

In effect, late stage capitalism becomes the anti-thesis of the spirit of capitalism - devoid of competition, free innovation, and upward mobility. In an ideal capitalism society, the most talented should earn the most, but the compounding effect of capital makes it so that whoever holds wealth the longest earns the most.
2 HR AGO
We have to look back to when corruption really started to run rampant with the capitalist system that we had.  It would have been when the robber barons started seizing land from people not willing to sell their land so they could build their train tracks through it.
2 HR AGO
In you're example you're neglecting the fact that this money &quot;parked&quot; in a mutual fund is being reinvested into these companies paying the same salaries that proletarians are slaving away for.  I agree, the tax structure in this country is broken.  It needs an overhaul badly, it's set up in such a way that those with the most and least pay hardly anything and those in the middle are stuck footing the bill.
2 HR AGO
Parked in some kind of fund*, yes. Ah, we do have some common ground.
1 HR AGO
Seizing and decentralizing the means of production is necessary to generate the Rule of Law necessary to overhaul (in legislation), executive, and adjudicate that tax system (a redistribution of wealth and thus power). Yes, it's going to take more than voting.
1 HR AGO
Going to be more than dealing with judges and politicians.
1 HR AGO
Preventing capitalism from infecting justice is only possible when you have evolved out of capitalism into socialism.
1 HR AGO
That is highly unlikely, of course.
1 HR AGO
Evolved out of capitalism into socialism* That's a mighty big assumption you're making.
1 HR AGO
I've given you the game-theoretic explanation. It's the Golden Rule.
1 HR AGO
No it is not.
1 HR AGO
The Golden Rule is do unto others, not to take from others and give unto you
1 HR AGO
Though shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbors posessions.
1 HR AGO
Take from others to give to others, yes sometimes.
1 HR AGO
T42T is about enforcing cooperation.
1 HR AGO
You can't enforce morality, [[h0p3]].
1 HR AGO
It's retaliatory. It's why we get to flip tables. It's why I agree to violent revolution.
1 HR AGO
Define morality.
1 HR AGO
You might be able to enforce moral laws, but you can't enforce the feeling.
1 HR AGO
Oh, you can enforce systems that engender that feeling.
1 HR AGO
The link I gave you above will demonstrate how those incentives are created.
1 HR AGO
Just because you make someone follow a moral path it doesn't mean they're a moral person.
1 HR AGO
I did not make that claim either.
1 HR AGO
It turns out that The Golden Rule means enforcing The Golden Rule on yourself and others as yourself.
1 HR AGO
I can't watch it right now, I'm back at home.
1 HR AGO
Np. Try it when you get the chance. It is an interaction demonstration.
1 HR AGO
interactive*
1 HR AGO
I saw that.
1 HR AGO
You've really moved on to some form of Marxism, huh?
1 HR AGO
To a Neo-Rawlsian and Platonic form, yes. I'm happy to communicate in the language of ~~sinners~~ economists as best I can. There are good mathematical reasons to agree to it. It all depends on whether or not you choose to play games with humans as perfectly comptitive or more cooperative. That's conceptually part of what it means to be moral.
1 HR AGO
I think Marx was good and attempting to provide a pragmatic initial account of human history from Hegel's idealism; he was often wrong, and he lacked a metaethical account to justify why we ought to do as he said.
1 HR AGO
He gets much of the letter of the law wrong, but much of the spirit correct. He also could not have made predictions about the technology we have. Like Adam Smith, he could not see everything.

I think where your argument is lacking is the incentive.  These collectivist philosophies all have the preclusion that everyone is within the  height of the bell curve and there are no outliers.  Capitalism takes this into account whereas any collectivist system does not.  How do you divide the people's resources when you have others that outperform or underperform to the societal standards that have been set?
1 HR AGO
If I knew how to give an absolute account, I would. I'm giving you the correct foundation, but I do not know all of what should be built on it or how. It is clear that government spending have incentivized a great number of things. Sometimes centralized computing is more energy efficient, and sometimes it's not. This is a federalism problem.

I am not claiming all markets are wrong, not at all.
1 HR AGO
In fact, I'm willing to consider radical markets.

But you're saying when they fail, people have the right, nay, the duty to remove resources from the offenders and distribute the resources accordingly.
1 HR AGO
That is a cool book. They might be my frenemies, but I am a huge fan.
1 HR AGO
You are talking about patterned justice. Yes, it must be correct again and again. I do not know how to do it well in all cases. Lockean and Nozickian property theories will always collapse on themselves as power centralizes through monopolistic or oligopolistic control of resources.
1 HR AGO
If you would like a copy of the book, let me know. I think you might enjoy talking about the book with me. Sometimes we agree on the Horseshoe, for example, on the issue of censorship.
1 HR AGO
And, to be clear, having a &quot;fair tax&quot; system is going to &quot;remove resources from the offenders and distribute the resources accordingly&quot;
1 HR AGO
I can tell you this, those who stand behind the Veil of Ignorance, who seek justice when they don't know who they will be in the world, are the only proper wielders of the Ring of Gyges.
1 HR AGO
It turns out that given the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, justice is about constructing, maintaining, and making progress in distributions of power (wealth, information, etc.) decentralized enough that those at the bottom have the most resources given any of the available possible worlds from ours (at any given time slice).
1 HR AGO
[[h0p3]], the majority of people at the bottom are too ignorant to have power.  The fact that we have universal suffrage of those 18 and above shows just how much we've messed up.
1 HR AGO
I agree. You don't deserve a vote compared to me.
1 HR AGO
But, I must educate anways. I don't predict I will succeed.
1 HR AGO
That may be.
1 HR AGO
:shrug:
1 HR AGO
I'm not a property owner, I don't provide anything of value right now, I'm just a little drone bee flying into school and keeping kids awake for 6 hours aday.
1 HR AGO
It is clearly possible to distribution information power. I can see it. Whether or not that will occur is a matter of having a sufficient number of people elect to play by the second greatest commandment.
1 HR AGO
I think your value is not in virtue of how capitalism has commodified you.
1 HR AGO
What is the second greatest commandment?
1 HR AGO
What is our value?  How do we determine that value?  Who assigns us that determined value?
1 HR AGO
Preach!
1 HR AGO
You ask such good questions.
1 HR AGO
Do others get to see this value?
1 HR AGO
What is moral value?
1 HR AGO
The only normative value by definition.
1 HR AGO
All others are instrumental to The End.
1 HR AGO
You must have faith in something being intrinsically valuable.
1 HR AGO
What is it?
1 HR AGO
But see, the only value that matters is the one most impossible to value.
1 HR AGO
Go on.
1 HR AGO
You can't assign moral value, society will never agree to what is moral, and morality comes from God.
1 HR AGO
I agree that we do not construct or invent value, just as we do not construct or invent history. We can only ever construct the information available to us to model what is objectively moral.
1 HR AGO
You agree moral value is assigned in all contexts, right?
1 HR AGO
It is not simply a man-made construction.
1 HR AGO
You and I agree (used to) that murdering babies was highly immoral, but the majority of people in the US believe we are morally inferior for insisting that women not be allowed to murder babies.
1 HR AGO
Define &quot;in all contexts&quot;
1 HR AGO
brb
1 HR AGO
In all possible worlds, categories, set, kinds, and degrees. Take any epistemic or ontic circumstance or perspective, and you have a context.
1 HR AGO
If it's real, then it has some kind of moral value (even if a negative or neutrally permitted one).
1 HR AGO
That is to say, capitalism as a man-made construction does define your value. Something else more objective than egoistic subjectivity defines value, who we ought to be, and what we ought to (and what it means to be morally motivated).
1 HR AGO
doesn't define*
1 HR AGO
Capitalism allows the market (ie the collective &quot;they&quot;) determine what is to be valued and what that value should be based on the supply and demand of the people.  Corporations or by extension the people who run them just can't say one day what has value and what does not.  They can try to persuade people to value certain things artificially or &quot;trick&quot; people by misinformation but they cannot make someone value something on their own.

It is a model built on perfect competition, on T4T. It is not The Golden Rule. It is not the best model, it is not the Biblical model, it is clearly not the principle which the God of the Bible through Jesus has told us to use to empirically discover the fitting distribution of value assignments.
22 MIN AGO
Capitalism attempts to be a heuristic to help us model the objective value assigned by God. It's obviously not the correct heuristic according to the Bible.
21 MIN AGO
It encompasses the golden rule, tit for tat with your best foot forward.  I don't see how you don't think the Golden Rule applies in Capitalism.  Respect others' property, and expect them to respect yours is the basis of capitalism.  Property rights must strictly be enforced for capitalism to function, without them it fails.
18 MIN AGO
The Golden Rule is Tit For Two Tats
18 MIN AGO
It's fundamentally NOT a game of perfect competition. It is collectivist. It is taking the feelings, opinions, desires, and identities of others into our own weighing of who we are and should be as individuals.
17 MIN AGO
The Golden Rule practiced by enough people actually defeats T4T of Capitalism.
17 MIN AGO
And it generates more global utility.
17 MIN AGO
Exactly what counts as the correct state of affairs of the hohfeldian property rights is an empirical matter.
15 MIN AGO
No, no, no.  Feelings, opinions, and desires of others doesn't mean shit to me or the Bible.  The Golden Rule isn't a lovey dovey rule, it's meant to be &quot;deal with others honestly and in a straight-forward manner&quot;
15 MIN AGO
I do believe in respecting property rights of others, including their self-ownership via our collective ownership.
15 MIN AGO
Self-ownership via collective ownership
14 MIN AGO
lol, that's some enslavement speak there.
14 MIN AGO
Yes, your identity is the sum of your beliefs and desires, which is certainly something both emotionally driven by your limbic system and your more rational, conscious frontal lobe (system 1 and 2).
14 MIN AGO
'You can work for yourself all you want, after you work for &quot;us&quot;'
14 MIN AGO
And, I think you don't own yourself all the way down.
14 MIN AGO
That's what it means to practice The Golden Rule.
13 MIN AGO
Not at all, I belong to God.
13 MIN AGO
The girl who is drowning in the pool next to you, and you are the only person who can save her, she has a Hohfeldian moral claim right to your body in that moment.
13 MIN AGO
She owns you!
13 MIN AGO
No one else.
13 MIN AGO
The duty to save her has a corresponding right.
13 MIN AGO
Not at all.
12 MIN AGO
She has no right to claim I endanger myself to save her unless we have a predetermined contract stating that.
12 MIN AGO
I agree, The Good is prioritized over all of us as the first commandment, and from the commandment springs the second: we are all equal bound to each other
12 MIN AGO
Oral or written.
12 MIN AGO
Ah, there you go. You really don't believe you owe any one any thing to any degree without your explicit consent.
11 MIN AGO
It's psychopathy.
11 MIN AGO
If I can't swim and I can't touch in the pool why would I jump in and kill us both?
11 MIN AGO
It's a switch inside you that you choose to turn on and off.
11 MIN AGO
A switch inside of me won't help me swim.
11 MIN AGO
Indeed, you are a computer...and computers are just switches. You can modify your switches.
10 MIN AGO
It's part of being a turing machine.
10 MIN AGO
I reject your claims of ownership over me.
10 MIN AGO
You reject the model, that has nothing to do with the truth. We all share ownership in each other to various degrees and kinds in our contexts. That girl really does own you in that moment.
10 MIN AGO
I'm not guilty of killing junkies by walking by them on the street and not physically restraining them until they get clean.  That is in a sense the exact same as watching someone drown and doing nothing
9 MIN AGO
I will continue to come back to the girl example.
9 MIN AGO
No, she doesn't own me.
9 MIN AGO
At all.
8 MIN AGO
If you think you ought to save her, if it is God's will that you save her, if it is the right thing to do, if you are morally obligated to save her, then yeah...that's what ownership is like. Let us assume saving her in no way endangers you; it just costs you time and the opportunity costs of whatever else you could be doing with your body. I am absolutely convinced that your duty to her is not constructed by Capitalism but by the Moral law which is external to us (one give to us by The Good or God, or whatever we should call it).
6 MIN AGO
Moral property rights are only justified on moral grounds.
6 MIN AGO
I would attempt to save her because it would provide me with a sense of pride, with a sense of decency, but not of obligation.  You cannot say because it would be the &quot;right&quot; thing to do then I no longer own my self or that amount of time.  That is still mine and the choice istill mine, no one else can insist that she owns me or that moment in time.
4 MIN AGO
That is a powerful claim. I appreciate your honesty and approach to virtuous character. I'm going to let you think on it, and I will think more too. I have to AFK for family time.
1 MIN AGO
Have fun, I have quite a few of your words looked up and websites opened to read after I finish my paper.
