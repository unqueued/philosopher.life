<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was a very charged day. </p><p>Nobody went to the computer lab today because the lady in charge had a death in the family. That meant that I didn't get to weld today, and we were all given a project.</p><p>We were tasked with building the second simulator structure (so we'd have two right next to each other for more complex simulator fabrications), as I suspected we might. My worries from yesterday were well-founded. Our teacher obviously expected us to do well on this, since we're using parts he had to go through a bureaucracy to beg to get in the first place. I still think it was a lot to ask of us considering how we've never actually done any buttweld fitting before. Going straight into production may not have been the wisest choice. A few practice constructions would have benefited us considerably.</p><p>Nash and Mel went to carve out and bevel the generic sockolets to make them fit 3&quot; pipe.  I asked Nash and Mel to leave one sockolet for me to try, since I want to have at least experienced doing it. Apparently, you can buy sockolets that are specific, but most people now just get generic ones for a job. This will be useful to know.</p><p>Chris and I went to the simulator to measure it and create an isometric drawing. It took us over an hour. We found that we were off by a 1/4th of an inch somewhere in the height. Our teacher helped us here since he said it was possible that it was off. We checked the level, and we did the measurements again. It was Chris' first measurement that was off. I really hope we got it right, lol, because I drew it up, we did the math for it, and we went straight into cutting the pipe.</p><p>That shit was very heavy. Chris and I made the majority of cuts, specifically on the large pieces (since we couldn't afford to get them wrong due to a lack of materials). I eventually went to shape/bevel my sockolet. It turned out to be easy, although, I didn't put much of a bevel on it. My teacher said that normally a full bevel is applied, although it was just fine for what we were doing. Mine also actually fit the pipe, unlike Nash's and Mel's. They didn't pay enough attention or practice enough when we worked on stainless steel, and it really shows now that it is assumed we can do it. They really do suck at it. Their suckiness played out today.</p><p>We then had to bevel the pipe. I explained how it should be done, even though I've never officially done it for any project. 37.5 degrees. I showed them how to use the bevel angle measuring tool. My bevels turned out pretty good. Their bevels were...not beautiful. Honestly, even Chris' bevels weren't really great. There's definitely some virtue theoretic tricks to it. I hope that I can practice becoming really good at it. It's hard to articulate how to get it right, how to compensate, correct, etc.. Problematically, Nash and Mel did not understand  (even though they should have) that they shouldn't bevel into the inner diameter of the pipe itself since it actually shortens the length of the pipes themselves. Luckily, I gave each pipe a hair more length anticipating the mistakes. </p><p>The teacher noted how deeply they beveled, which thinned the walls of the pipe too much. This made it much harder to tack, as it was very easy to burn holes right through it. Is it my job to correct every single mistake I see? Maybe. It's difficult to have the right kinds of relationships with my classmates if I'm literally their teacher (blind and inexperienced as I am) the entire time.</p><p>We started fitting and tacking. Nash and Mel decided they were going to do the tacking. They wanted to put the pipes/fittings flush up against each other, but I told them we needed a gap. I got a wire for it and showed them how it is done. I even told them that I was required to use an even larger gap, and warned we might burn holes. They didn't even think it was possible to weld it but also felt like they could do it (contradiction). </p><p>Chris did the fitting (which he tends to do well at, even eyeballing). I had to explain that we needed the high-lo's correct all the way around and that it needed to come straight out (I had brought out two squares and a level for this). In addition, we had to use the wire to gap it. This was the first time any of us had actually done any buttweld fitting, mind you. I should not be the one explaining this. The teacher should have been there from the beginning. </p><p>Nash's first tack attempt made a hole, as I suspected it might. I suggested we turn the heat down (this helped considerably for me but not them; note, I had to keep knocking it down). I then asked to level and check it, but Nash wasn't going to have any of it (I probably made him look bad). He went straight into tacking the rest of it. That is to say, Nash went on to very clumsily tack it. Holes were everywhere. He gave up. Mel tried his hand. It didn't go well. I said I could fill them in, but Mel said I shouldn't touch it. I said I was going to try anyway. I turned the heat down again, and I did it. Lickity-split too. I jumped from one tack to other and nailed it into place. Of course, that shut them up for a second. It was obvious that they couldn't use the stick welder on low heat. I know it's hard to strike it, but it filled the holes safely.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was only after my tacking that I took a level to the fitting. I should have stuck with my first instinct and assumed we may not have fit it perfectly (because we didn't). Sadly, it was slightly off. You couldn't see it by your naked eye very well, but the level did not lie. I gave what is at this point my classic &quot;oh shit&quot; facepalm tarnation face, which everyone knows to mean we've made a mistake that is going to cost us. I pointed it out, and Chris saw what I meant. Nash and Mel thought it was fine. I said it wasn't. The teacher came by and said it wasn't right either. He took the squares against the side of the fitting and ran the side along the pipe. It was obviously off. Hence, we had to dismantle it. </p><p>It was only then that the teacher explained we needed to use even thinner wire because the bevels were so deep (I also worry the teacher has given contradictory advice to me over the course of semester on this; I remember taking a trip to Millwright specifically to pick up thicker gauges wire for my welding sessions). In any case, as our teacher informed us again, there is some leeway on the angle of the bevel and the gap which must be decided by the welder's tastes.</p><p>At this point, Mel decided the problem was that we were stick welding (embarrassed by the fact that I could tack a lot better than he can, even though that's all he ever wants to do). He convinced the teacher to let him MIG-weld it instead (any retard can MIG). This was obviously not the problem. I pointed out that welding wasn't the problem, it was the fitting. They ignored me. Fine. So, I decided to let them work on it themselves. They don't have to take my advice or hear my opinion. I just moved onto the other leg of the simulator. They clearly didn't need me, lol. Chris helped cut the piece for them, but saw I was moving onto the second leg. He decided to join me while Nash and Mel did it their way.</p><p>The teacher came to help us now. He explained the proper technique for fitting and told us not to use the jackstand if we could help it (although said that sometimes you can't help it). He said that with time we'd get a feel for the high-los and that if we needed (and when we could), we could look inside the pipe to get the right high-lo's. We fit the fitting on, gave one tack on top, and continue to fit, measure with the square, adjust, and tack it. Voila, done. We then moved onto fitting the second piece of pipe (sitting on the other &quot;C&quot; side of the T). We fitted it and tacked it. The level looked great. Even the square looked fine. Ah, but our teacher came by and explained that we should never use the square (as he had just shown us earlier) on the pipe. He didn't explain why, but my theory is that we can't trust the bevel of the pipe, although I guess we can trust the manufactured fittings to be straight for the square (which is what the teacher had just done on the first leg).  </p><p>The teacher then set two combination squares against each pipe on either side of the T (instead of against each other) and had us measure the distance from the inside and outside of the lengths of the rulers of the combination squares. They were off by 1/8th of an inch. So, clearly, it wasn't good enough. The teacher told us that he thought we should attach the sockolets after these fittings because we already had it set up.</p><p>After the teacher had left, Chris remarked that the teacher should have shown us that from the beginning. Chris was annoyed that the teacher was annoyed at having to show us this. I was annoyed too. Luckily, everything else was clean. I cut the tacks on either side, and we kept knocking it into place and testing with this new method. I then retacked it. </p><p>After tacking it, Mel comes over to me and without saying &quot;sorry&quot; attempted to apologize. He says they really screwed up big time. He said he wanted to work with us all together after they fixed their mistake. I glanced at what they had done. Unfortunately, using MIG puts a shit ton of material down. They had practically welded (not merely tacked) the pipe and fitting together. Unfortunately, they didn't fit it appropriately; it wasn't aligned, level, and straight. They didn't even try to get it right. They just tacked/pseudowelded. Ii looked really bad. He said they were cutting it and beveling it again. Afterward, they were coming to work with us.</p><p>After Mel left, Chris and I gave each other the look. We really don't like working with these clowns. Whatever. We then talked about how to get the sockolets on in the right place. We had measured down to the floor on the simulator, but that included flanges on the bottom (which we weren't going to attach to our leg). We decided to subtract the flange takeout and measure from the end of the pipe we had, marking it with a wrap around. We did it for all three sockolets. We then had to figure out how to center these. My idea was to measure the outside diameter of the sockolets, and then mark the radius from our center point on either side. That way, when we fit the sockolet, we'd know where the edges should be. Mind you, these sockolets were very poorly cut by Nash and Mel; they were wobbly! This meant that we couldn't just nicely apply them and level them. I think they need to be fixed before we do this part.</p><p>It was then that Mel came by a second time. He said that the teacher had come out of his office and taken one look at Mel and Nash's work and shook his head in anger. Apparently, the teacher was disappointed+angry. He was definitely pissed at Mel and Nash. I'm not sure if he was angry with me or not. I think he partially was since he assumes I'm going to force them to do my way every time (although, even my way has mistakes, although generally fewer and more correctable ones). I think my teacher really needed to be a bit more angry with himself though. Ultimately, I am not in control of the class. I give my half-educated opinions, but people don't have to listen to me. Anyways, Mel said they really messed up badly, said the MIG wasn't working out, and he wanted my help fixing their mistake. I gave my condolences and said I'd be happy to help them. Chris pointed out that class was almost over. I said we'd try anyway. I left Chris to it, and I moved to help Mel and Nash.</p><p>I looked at the bevels, and they were fucking awful. They were chewed up and far worse than before. They destroyed the fitting and the lengthy pipe. I took out my measuring tape and an unused fitting. 6-3/4&quot; I believe, and their fitting was now 6-1/2&quot;. Jesus Christ. I kind of panicked for a second. This mistake had repercussions since we couldn't just replace the fitting. But, I realized we could just recut some short pipe for the other side (extending the 14&quot; pipe to 14-1/4&quot;) to make up for it. So, I said we could probably fix it. Mel said he really wanted to fix it today because our teacher was so angry. </p><p>Unfortunately, Chris and Nash weren't going to touch this one. It was me and Mel. I tried to explain to Mel how he needed to hold it while fitting. I wish I could do the fitting, but I needed to do the tacking because I'm the only one who can strike an arc on such low heat and make it a legit tack. He felt he had it right, and I tacked the top. After he took his hands off it, I inspected it. It was way fucking off. The high-lo's were decent enough, but it wasn't even remotely straight. Maybe this shit is really hard, I don't know. I tried to knock it into place, but it was clearly too far off. After knocking it, the high-lo's were off. Thus, I said we couldn't fix it as it was. We needed to cut it and do it again. This dismayed him. Luckily, I didn't even need to cut it. I just bent it off with my hands. By that time, it was close to quitting time. We started cleaning. </p><p>Mel was unhappy that we didn't actually get it fixed. I don't know what to say. They didn't listen to me, and they didn't really try to do a good job. I knew it was going to be a clusterfuck, and so I moved onto a different part of the project. I care about what I put my name on. Don't get me wrong. I definitely made mistakes and had my own hiccups too. Nobody is perfect. This was a kind of &quot;you reap what you sow&quot; moment though. I hope Mel and Nash will, yet again, learn to listen to me more often. They clearly need my help. We'll still have fuckups, but it generally won't be as often or as bad.</p><p>After we finished cleaning, the teacher told us we could go. He didn't seem too unhappy (maybe his Youtube watching calmed him down?). </p><p>I got some gas and mailed my forms to AB&amp;T. I should talk to my teacher about what tools to get with around $200. I want to use those funds up before July.</p></div>
