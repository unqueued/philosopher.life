<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My chillun played against each other. My daughter won. They had a lot of questions. I walked them through the stack again.</p><p>Daughter:</p><p>She mulls. I keep: mountain, port, caverns, vial, 2xleaders, chief. She drops lackey. TOPDECK LACKEY! FUCK YEAH! Only 5 cards in the deck that could save me. She drops another, swing, I block (I just need to buy time). I caverns, vial, pass. She connects lackey-&gt;ringleader-&gt;1x Matron. Ouch. I drop port, chief, pass. She drops a vial, still sitting one land; so much pressure for a single mountain. I drop trashmaster, pass. She cratermakers my vial. I land, kiki-&gt;trash-&gt;swing with clone+chief for 8, and clone shoots her best vial. She vials MWM. I make a leader-&gt;whirler, kiki-&gt;trash, swing for 16, blown up her remaining vial, drop cratermaker. She draws a land and drops MWM. Drop whirler, kiki it, swing for 20. GG.</p><p>Son:</p><p>Mountain, vial, lackey, MWM, 2x chiefs, driver. Uh, yeah, I'll keep that. I go mountain, lackey. He mirrors. I drop vial and pass (inc is a problem, but don't have a bomb to drop to make the risk worth it). He drops driver. I drop MWM for defense. He wastes me and drops another lackey. I can't pay, then waste his caverns. He drops port, pass, EoT-&gt;vial-&gt;driver. Upkeep he ports me (slick bastard). I pass with 3 chiefs and topdecked lackey in hand, wishing I had that mountain, <code>/tear</code>. He drops another land-&gt;matron-&gt;ringleader (can't afford he realizes later), EoT-&gt;Vial-&gt;chief. Draw waste (sandbag him), vial-&gt;chief, drop lackey, swing with all but 2 tokens and lackey, he kills a lackey and loses matron to driver, I waste his port, pass. He cratermakers, pass. I vial chief, drop topdeck leader (for 1 mana, fuck yeah) into...whiff. =(, swing the same, cratermaker takes driver, he takes 8. He drops something. I drop lackey, swing with everything, he loses all but warchief and goes to 1. He whiffs leader. GG.</p><p>Daughter:</p><p>Mountain, caverns, vial, sting, matron, chief, krenko. Cool. Mountain, vial, pass. She goes caverns, lackey. I caverns, sting her lackey. She drops port and MWMs? I ramp, draw leader, and welp, pass. Daughter is easily goaded into play skirk when I say she only has one red mana source: lulz (and I said this as I typed while we played ;P), sac tokens, chief, wastes me. I vial-&gt;chief, matron-&gt;SS (not an easy call for me). She drops lackey. Upkeep ports my mountain, I top deck another, SS, timmy all but chief, vial-&gt;matron-&gt;kiki, swing with matrons for bait (and she doesn't take it, but doesn't know why). She incs SS, I ping her in response, swings with chief into mine (I'll take it ;P). I leader for chief, inc, mwm, leader (rofl), krenko, tap, swing. I only then realize that skirk was what I should have done (because who gives a shit about leader and one of my matrons). She swings lackey-&gt;whirler (mistake number 2 on my part). Ramp, Vial-&gt;kiki, skirk, chief, krenko for 6, sac 2, leader, replace 2 more tokens with lackeys, sac for MWM, sac MWM for cratermaker, kiki-&gt;leader-&gt;(matron,leader,chief), sac tokens for chief then leader-&gt;driver, sac lackeys for matron-&gt;trash and play him, sac matron for driver, sac leader for driver, sac kiki for mana to sac crater to hit her chief, sac leader and krenko to inc her whirler with MWM drawn, sac leader for MWM and MWM and one token to inc her remaining leader, draw and drop my land for the turn, and swing for 34 damage unblocked. Overkill, but we were interested in what maximize damage looked like here.</p><p>Son:</p><p>Mull no lander into: mountain, waste, 2x lackey, inc, crater. Cool. Wish that said Krenki instead because I can guarantee a connect. He mirrors. I inc, connect, crater. He drops MWM. I drop land, vial, lackey. I hold back my skirk and keep my waste open. He drops SS. I swing with crater then shoot SS. He matrons-&gt;krenko. I matron-&gt;inc (he called it immediately too). He whirlers, I sac out to inc the whirler (and draw an inc), and he doesn't attack (with a bad reason). My son drops chief (and says, &quot;how do you like them goblin warchiefs?&quot; LOL), no swing, EoT-&gt;matron-&gt;leader. No upkeep effects, ramp, draw and drop land, leader-&gt;(chief,leader), inc his chief (I know, krenko), lackey, he incs it, pass. He drops lackey, pass. Still no upkeep effects from him, vial kiki, he incs (before priority pass), I matron-&gt;inc in prep for krenko, chief, swing with matron clone and leader, he takes it (wisely), pass. He drops nothing because he's skeered of inc. No upkeep effects, leader-&gt;(matron, lackey, chief), chief, matron-&gt;krenko, swing with leaders and chiefs, he double blocks a chief with tokens, takes 6. He drops land and Krenko. I inc, lackey, krenko, activate, and he concedes. GG.</p></div>
