<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>There is a longstanding debate in this wiki on where to {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Focus.html">Focus</a>} for the long-term. There are many problem to weigh against each other, and I simply will never have enough information to make a good choice. I have made progress on this front, though I still have no decision.</p><p>Postmodernism requires an answer. Shooting for a metamodern foundation is a huge risk. I actually have no idea if I can succeed or to what <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>. Oh, I'm arrogant as fuck, and I throw down like few humans do in this space, but I cannot claim to be able to stand up to the Saints. My verbal reasoning simply isn't good enough. Even with access to more resources than any of those grandmasters, and even if I can recognize some non-trivial portion of what the problem is: I don't have the IQ to answer this problem. Do I take this risk knowing I'm just not smart enough to have a reasonable chance of succeeding? To some extent, I have to do this work for my own {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>}, but there is a difference between building out the explanatory+justificatory work for myself and for others. How far do I go?</p><p>I could also go for the political solution. I've got the chops to defend a Kantian framework, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Original%2520Position.html">The Original Position</a>, and I can communicate it to utilitarians decently enough. I have enough technical prowess to know I have a good idea in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Outopos.html">Outopos</a>. AI, of course, is this giant monkeywrench. I have no idea how to even reason about that effectively enough. </p><p>All of these rely upon people actually hearing me. That is probably never going to happen. I could write to convince academics, but even that is a waste of time; memetic popularity contests aren't going to work here.</p><p>I could also just submit to the claim I will never have any reasonable chance (however slim) to defeat golem and therefore instead prepare my family for a life of incredible sadness. It's definitely the conservative choice, but the assumption doesn't seem justified. I think that's exactly what everyone else is doing in this epic tragedy of the commons.</p><p>I've decided I don't want to live a life in which I'm not trying to practice <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>. Again, I've been arguing about this with RPIN, <strike>KIN</strike>, and ehyeh for a long time. My choices all look like failures. Ugh! I must take risks, even if I'm going to lose, I must attempt to do <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Right.html">The Right</a> thing.</p><p>So, I could choose to go more theoretical or more practical. I realize, most people consider both entirely theoretical, lol. I still don't know. I will continue to wander with aim to find the place for my tentpegs.</p><hr><p>Added nightly version of the wiki to {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Connect.html">Connect</a>}. </p><hr><p>Cleaning up orphans.</p></div>
