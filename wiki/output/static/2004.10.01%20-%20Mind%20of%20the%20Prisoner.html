<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Viktor Frankl in his book, Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning, explores the stages of thought found in the prisoners of Auschwitz. He explains that prisoners go through three phases of mental reactions: ‚Äúthe period following his admission; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine; and the period following his release and liberation‚Äù (26). Frankl examines a variety of mental reactions common through each of these stages. Viktor Frankl holds a numbing of the senses and a deadened morality for the sake of survival as a significant principle that guided prisoners throughout the Holocaust.</p><p>Even from the beginning of a captive‚Äôs imprisonment there is very little consideration of morality or ethical issues. Frankl explains that, ‚ÄúEvery man was controlled by one thought only: to keep himself alive for the family waiting for him at home, and to save his friends‚Äù (23). Although one could make the argument that the concern for one‚Äôs family is an ethical concern, Frankl demonstrates that prisoners were not actually concerned about the morality of whatever it took to save themselves from death. Dawning upon Frankl‚Äôs first phase the prisoner strikes out his or her previous life. The prisoners come to grip their fate, they most likely will not survive the concentration camp, but they should do whatever is necessary to survive as long as possible. Ironically, even thought the majority of prisoners desired to live, supposedly, ‚Äúthe thought of suicide was entertained by nearly everyone, if only for a brief time‚Äù (36).</p><p>Frankl explains the second phase as a time of ‚Äúrelative apathy in which [the prisoner] achieved a kind of emotional death‚Äù (39). Prisoners began some basic human functions in terms of the loss of feelings and disgust for what was around them. Frankl says that, ‚Äúthe prisoner who had passed into the second stage of his psychological reactions did not avert his eyes any more. By then his feelings were blunted, and he watched unmoved‚Äù (40). Apathy was a self-defense mechanism for prisoners who had lived long enough in concentration camps. In the midst of apathy towards the diabolic activity found in the camp, prisoners became consumed with an almost animalistic instinct for survival. Undernourishment led to a serious ‚Äúpreoccupation with food‚Äù (52). Interestingly, some prisoners kept up their hope and desire to live through images of their families. The author himself says, ‚Äúnothing could touch the strength of my love, my thoughts, and the image of my beloved‚Äù (58). </p><p>Victor Frankl goes on to explain a silence among the prisoners. Frankl states, ‚ÄúOn entering camp a change took place in the minds of the men. With the end of uncertainty there came the uncertainty of the end. It was impossible to foresee whether or when, if at all, this form of existence would end‚Äù (90). Life to the advanced prisoner didn‚Äôt seem to have much of a future. Prisoners could not even think in terms of how it would be like outside of the camp, instead they could only think narrowly in terms of life (and the end) within the camp.</p><p>The last stages of imprisonment consisted of possibly the largest shift in perspective. Victor Frankl explains, ‚ÄúWe had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life‚Äîdaily and hourly‚Äù (98). The life of the prisoner was a daily trial. Would they win that hour or that evening?</p><p>The liberated prisoner had no idea howto feel. Most prisoners didn‚Äôt want to even think about what had happened. Frankl demonstrated that non-prisoners of these concentration camps could not truly understand or evaluate how these people thought and felt. Thus, the liberated prisoners had difficulty explaining what went through their minds, most attempt to remain silent about the horrendous activities within concentration camps such as Auschwitz.</p><p>Lack of sleep, insufficient food, apathy, images of family, and the desire to survive were some major thoughts throughout the life and experience of those imprisoned in concentration camps. Frankl shows a breakdown of a person, eventually the meaning of life appears to be one big set of trials.
