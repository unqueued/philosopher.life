<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I keep arriving earliest. That's fine for now. I like that this is relaxed, but it may just be an appearance.</p><p>I heard some people teach specific subjects on a whim. I spoke with the others about this. I have several seminars I could offer. This would be a valuable use of my time. I went through the foodchain and tried to speak to Dorsey about how I wanted to use his lab (apparently, he gets in trouble if the computers visit any site not on a list...Brietbart is included as ay-okay). I'll see him on Monday.</p><p>Matt learned the new &quot;data&quot; forms, but withheld showing the rest of us (my brother was correct about him). At the end of the night, he showed us. His inability to reconcile his absurd trust in authority with these forms is sad. I simplified what he told us out loud. It shows the glaring contradictions in him too. The difference between what we put on these sheets of paper and what actually occurs is disgusting. I continue to catch him lying too (small ones, but clearly knowingly false); it's hard to trust what he has to say. Whitney, on the other hand, is as honest as they come (though not bright); I like her.</p><p>Still no actual learning planned by those above me. My lesson plans are useless so far.</p><p>I took the 8th grade girls to work on algebra. I had to work my way through a network of people to have the right to tutor them. I let them struggle on the board and hinted. One girl required significant walkthroughs. Every girl got it though, and I'm glad.</p><p>I took all the kids (who wanted to go) watching a movie (Cars...<code>/kill me</code>) to the computer lab instead (about half the students came with me). A bit later, Matt called us to the library so that 7 kids would play board games with him while everyone else sat there. I think they were having more fun (and doing something more useful) in the computer lab (kiddos, get yo' asses on them machines and LIVE). I spent my time just talking to the kids. They have some sad fucking stories, I tell you what. I may not be the bouncy happy-go-lucky dude, but I'm going to think with them as best I can. They need it. I had the opportunity to discuss ethics and the value of education as I see it with several students; it's good that I have more background in vidya than any of the adults there as well. I talked with some boys about arguing, ad hominem, kindly speaking with each to the best of their abilities, and taking each other seriously (at least when I'm around, right?).</p><p>I continue to stay as quiet as I can, listen, and wait for my time to kindly strike. Obviously, I think the adults are all retarded, most of them evil, and the system is fucked inside and out. The odds are against these chillun; this place is a prison-daycare filled with prisonguards who only really care about these children insofar as the guards might get in trouble or to the degree to which the kids amuse them. I will attempt to find the path of least resistance for making moves that actually help these children. </p><p>I think my 5th graders are growing to like me a little bit. I'm trying to connect with the quiet students and the most rambunctious of all ages. The ends of the bellcurves need my help the most. I'm trying to learn the 6th graders' names now (not my students, but I don't care).</p><p>I had some students say goodbye to me tonight. That is not the usual.</p></div>
