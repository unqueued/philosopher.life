<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was a great day. </p><p>We got our study points for our next exam, and I got my AB&amp;T form signed (and mailed). I've yet to text for more though. We put fake finishing touches on the work we did yesterday, and our teacher eventually told us to make a 4 on 6 Lateral and Saddle (he would check them after his meeting). We smashed through them. I did the saddle myself, which has cardinal direction symmetry to it, and my initial portaband saw cut was so clean that I not only made a super clean piece but decided to fuck around by making the leftover piece into a saddle as well. He eventually graded it (I wasn't there to hand him the pieces), and he took the leftover crappy saddle (not my perfect one) as the piece to be judged (said it was good). I think he's purposely saying he doesn't like stuff to slow us down. The reason I think this: our good pieces aren't changing, and he gives us different appraisals even when there aren't differences. Anyways, I'm glad that even my trash piece was up to snuff.</p><p>My theory about why he's slowing us down:  if we finish all the content too early, it poses problems for him as a teacher. We're completing everything the upperclassmen have done and then some, and we're still accelerating through the program. We're probably a month ahead in shop work and about a month and a half in bookwork. Assuming socket welds and butt welds are going to be easy (since I've become a reasonable beveler, and many screwpipe principles transfer), we may smash through the entire course in 8 months or less.</p><p>We moved onto the simulator. The simulator is different because we had to draw to fit. We were told to draw for the 1&quot; pipe flanges (3 of them on the sim), get it approved, then do the measurements. I'm the only one who can draw it (Nash and Chris, hilariously, have previously had classes specifically on construction drawings, especially isometric...It's just not their thing, especially Nash). It was approved, and then our teacher showed us how he wanted to measure. My teacher felt that some of the things I wanted to measure on the drawing weren't worth measuring. I think he's wrong. The way he wanted to do stuff wasn't on paper. He wanted us to chalk mark the floor beneath the simulator. While we did this to some extent, it wasn't to the extent he was suggesting. </p><p>He's against what he calls &quot;stovepiping,&quot; which is just putting in a piece at a time and eyeballing (my teacher is obviously wise in this respect; planning is everything). Ironically, I fear that even his method has a kind of stovepiping element to it though. I strongly prefer having the drawing representation do most or all the work for me. I'm fine doing the math. I trust it more than doing it all by measurement. Don't get me wrong, I'll measure all day long. I want accurate initial measurements for key parts of the drawing, and then I want to do the math to figure out the rest. I'll still measure again after doing the math if I can. Multiple verifications for validity and coherence of your gameplan is crucial.</p><p>Obviously, I don't sound super confident. I've never done this before. My gut tells me my teacher doesn't exactly know what he's saying on this one though. He does not speak with the confidence I expect, and the way he attempts to solve certain kinds of geometry and measuring problems seem inefficient (and perhaps even less accurate) to me. But, not doing it his way may turn out poorly. I'm hoping it works. I think it should. We'll see.  It looks right to me. Execution details are another matter, but even that should be fine (I'm unspokenly in charge of what we do in our group). What we're building is structurally simple, it's just really big and unwieldy, and we can't really afford to be off even by perhaps more than an eighth of an inch anywhere. </p><p>Anyways, we got all the pieces cut, taped, and I started building before we left. If we're really lucky, we could finish this by the end of next Friday. Once we do, we move straight to socket welds (which everyone is just itching to try). I'm happy to do the simulator though. I wanted to do something complex, but my group mates did not. So, I decided to help them instead. Given the requirements, I designed what I felt would be the easiest to design around. Given that we'll have to do three other fabrications to fit into place alongside the one we've designed, we should give ourselves room. So, trying to find the simplest, flexible, and easy way was also a kind of challenge I enjoyed.</p><p>I have a new nickname today. Apparently, I am magic. </p><p>My teacher offered me (but not the others) the X-piece-90's and Y to take home. I find that weird since Chris definitely helped make them (and even Nash, to a much lesser extent).</p></div>
