I openly write another difficult letter to you. You have seen more than once that speaking with me can be quite painful. Feel free to think carefully about this letter as it is drafted.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">c</sup></button> My love for you is fierce.</p><p>Friendship is a concept I have wrestled to define for a long time. It is an ancient question, and I do not claim to have a satisfactory answer. One fundamental aspect of friendship which <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="k0sh3k.html">my wife</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="JRE.html">brother</a> have taught (and retaught) me over the years: deep friendship requires sacrificing our social capital with the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="other.html">other</a> for their sake.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">l</sup></button> They exercise their right to make me wrestle and look in the mirror wisely, and I'm grateful.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">gr</sup></button> Existential listening costs a lot. Taking each other's reasons, beliefs, and desires into our own weighing (as though they were our own) in a reciprocating justice-as-fairness deliberation is what empathy, love, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a> are really all about. Your brother asks you to listen closely again. </p><p>Sometimes we have to tell each other hard truths.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">t</sup></button> You will need to charitably ask yourself whether or not the pain I cause you is malicious, ignorant, or lovingly in pursuit of your justified eudaimonia. I am my sister's keeper. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="IA2DYJ.html">IA2DYJ</a>, and that means I seek not to make myself an exception. Hold me accountable as I do you; it is a requirement embedded in the second greatest commandment.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">h</sup></button> </p><p>You have the unenviable task of being the self-admitted sister of someone who all-too-often believes he is justified in his beliefs.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">dl</sup></button> Do you think I am <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Why%2520You%2520Might%2520Hate%2520Me.html">arrogant-appearing or simply arrogant</a>? I will listen closely. I am obviously <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a>, but even if I'm not a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="good.html">good</a> person, that doesn't make my argument unsound or unjustified. Of course, I have been wrong many times. I ain't a holy man, and I radically know it. I have quietly and gently come to you over and over on this issue, but you have ignored and avoided attempting to address my concern: now I must be louder.</p><p>Who died and made me judge, amiright? I take myself to be openly judged just as much as you here. I've been playing with my cards face-up on the table, so when you see me lay it all down on the line, you've had all the advantages I can give you in the dialectic. I'm required to play my hand when the cards demand it. I must place my tentpegs down with you (and vv.). <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Love.html">Love</a> is a commitment, and I am prepared to lovingly wrestle with you about what matters most all the way down. I owe you my best, and I'm convinced loving you means telling you what I understand to be the truth; I know it may cost us a great deal. Alright, here is the basic claim I need you to wrestle with:</p><h2 class="">It is morally wrong for you to work for Humana. </h2><p>No, it's not just a little bit wrong. It's profoundly evil, and we cannot justifiably pass over it or sweep it under the rug. You and I both have committed moral crimes against <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a> in working for Humana.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ir</sup></button> There's blood on our hands that won't wash off. Obviously, I can't claim to be wildly-holier-than-thou when I too have been responsible for the murder and gratuitous suffering of people through my occupation.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">a</sup></button> Working for Humana is one of my deepest regrets, and if you have the integrity to honestly look at it: it will be one of yours as well.</p><p>You face an existential crisis, and I'm here to help you reason about it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">la</sup></button> As others can attest, in piecemeal, I've consistently and carefully talked to you about this for years. I've tried to show you the moral cliff many times. I've even <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2017.09.21%2520-%2520Prompted%2520Introspection%2520Log.html">talked about this</a> in the wiki. It is difficult to get someone to understand something when their salary depends on their not understanding it.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">us</sup></button> I have tried to wake you gently, but now I must shake you awake before it is too late. I'm escalating with you, and I'm quadratically spending myself and my social capital to cry out: you shouldn't be this person, you never had to be, and you still don't have to be. Stop working for Humana: remove your hands from the deaths and needless suffering of others! You can find another place to work. I know you can. </p><p>You have claimed it is merely <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2019.02.14%2520-%2520L%253A%2520Morally%2520Questionable.html">morally questionable</a>. Then question it! If you actually think it's possibly wrong, don't you think you owe it to yourself, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a>, and even your God to find an answer? I know you feel like you don't have much time to read or think about it, but the moral and political implications of your occupation or vocation should be something you study all the time. It's your duty. From where I stand, you're actively avoiding looking for an answer, and you've deluded yourself into believing you're doing the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="right.html">right</a> thing. Allow me to clearly provide a fuller treatment of the argument for you because I'm not convinced you will honestly seek answers yourself.</p><p>Private health insurance providers, like Humana, should not exist. They aren't ethical, and they won't become ethical either. Those who fight without the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Golden%2520Rule.html">Golden Rule</a> gloves in the market will have the competitive advantage. Unless everyone chooses to be moral, there cannot be a moral competitor in perfect competition when it's so profitable not to be.</p><p>We can and should have universal healthcare regardless of our ability to pay. Like education, healthcare is a human right in the 21st century. There's no valid reason for us to privately pay for individual risk mitigation/distribution for healthcare; we should pay our society's healthcare costs together. It's immoral for us to sacrifice the well-being of humans to pay for profit and the artificial complexity of the administrative overhead introduced by private health insurance companies, including Humana.</p><p>Humana is an extortionist middleman profiting off the exploitation of patients and providers. One way Humana makes money is through bad faith denials of medical claims to as many people as they can get away with. Humana seeks to take your money (and any institution subsidizing you), and deny your claim. I worked in those databases, I ate meals with those who worked in claims, and I listened carefully to management: they were proud of it. You've even agreed with me on this before.</p><p>Humana is a dark-patterned maze designed to <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/why-your-health-insurer-does-not-care-about-your-big-bills" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">make you pay</a> absurd amounts of time wading through bureaucratic layers to even have the chance to get what you already paid for. Some people don't even have time to go through an appeals process: they need their medicine or operation now, it's an emergency! Humana profits by exhausting people through artificial complexity and information advantage abuse.  </p><p>It's a war of attrition, and the house will outresource you in many cases. You and your providers play phone and fax tag with Humana, walk through automated phone systems, get passed around from person to person, and each layer and agent in each department are paid (through carrots and sticks) to deny you and spend as little possible time with you as they can. Humana's record keeping and processing systems are designed to provide a legal defense trail, but they aren't designed to serve people in good faith. The intention isn't to help you: it's to hinder you from eating into their bottomline. Humana banks on the fact that many people will give up their rights. Most people have neither the means nor the education to viably take the risk of spending sometimes hundreds of hours fighting an overpowered machine while building personal paperwork trails necessary to even have a chance of getting what they deserve. You shouldn't have to be wealthy or an expert to receive the healthcare you deserve. Many people never get what they deserve even after appeals processes, and Humana is actuarially counting on it; it's built into their business model.</p><p>Another way Humana has made money is by selecting who is eligible for insurance. Take a look out at how insurance is sold. Further, look at purging policies; rescission is profit motivated. It's not about the well-being of people to Humana; it's about who makes Humana money. Even with regulations in place, private health insurance companies have every incentive to prevent or drop coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ex</sup></button> Historically, part of Humana's competitive advantage has been based upon how cleverly it can get away with revoking or never having offered coverage to those who would cost them too much in the first place.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sc</sup></button> </p><p>Those who have no coverage with Humana can be profoundly punished too. Humana applies enormous pressure to the providers around them. Off the street, an MRI will cost you thousands of dollars at a hospital, but Humana's power in the market enables them to negotiate that price down to $2. Humana's bargaining power generates absurd pricing differentials which destroy the lives of those who aren't insured for that hospital. Further, Humana reinforces a discriminatory system in which the underemployed don't have functioning health insurance, and thus often don't have access to medical care. Humana sins against the insured and uninsured alike.</p><p>The higher costs which people must pay for healthcare because of companies like Humana has staggering effects. Think about how many people have to choose between having their medicine or having food to eat. Think about how many people go bankrupt or live as the precariat just to have basic medical care. Even with insurance, how many people have to question whether or not they can afford to go to the emergency room? Think about how much unjustified stress Humana causes (it's difficult to even calculate the damage). Perhaps you've not taken a good look at what coverage people are receiving; like hush-money, Humana provides amazing coverage to its own employees compared to what average citizens have. </p><p>Humana's leverage enables them to externalize costs: they will shift the burden onto the customer or provider to whatever extent possible. At some point, we face an inelastic demand problem wherein health insurance companies have us over a barrel: we'll pay whatever price we have to pay for our health, including what they don't cover. The oligopoly held by private insurance serves as a loose cartel; a surprising number of insured people don't even have true catastrophic coverage.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">cv</sup></button> While insurance is meant to prevent this in the first place: most people spend all their assets during <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/03/massive-charges-227000-haunt-woman-after-emergency-out-of-network-ohsu-stay-for-heart-attack.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">catastrophes</a> and before they die (many prematurely) just trying to survive, and Humana aims to exploit that as far as they can. </p><p>Private health insurance, including Humana, is a powerful cause of our nation's absurdly high infant mortality rates, low life expectancy, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2674671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">double the average cost of healthcare</a> of any wealthy nation. This misery should not be a business model. Even after they pay you and all the other employees, they still make 1-2 billion dollars a year net income.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ca</sup></button> That income shouldn't exist: people suffered and died for it. The lives and suffering of human beings should not be held hostage and weighed against the profits of health insurance companies, including Humana. When Humana stands to profit from the suffering and/or deaths of others, it will choose to profit.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pr</sup></button></p><p>Health insurance companies even work to subvert democracy to maintain their business. Health insurance companies actively seek to prevent public healthcare for all, including the use of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/20/medicare-for-all-healthcare-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">propaganda</a>. Even Humana has spent over 1.5 million dollars a year lobbying since you've been there. Humana's goal, politically and economically, is to force people to go through private health insurance to relieve suffering and prevent death. Corporations, including the owners and workers which comprise them, are not above <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Moral%2520Law.html">The Moral Law</a> (even if they behave as though they are). Fiduciary &quot;responsibilities&quot; to your shareholders are ultimately mere social conventions, but those pressures do not excuse you from your overriding moral obligations to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="others.html">others</a>. </p><p>Of course, healthcare is extremely complex. There are many reasons healthcare is dystopically dysfunctional in our country, and privatized health insurance just happens to be one of the largest causes. Causality may be something we need to wrestle with here. Perhaps you don't see yourself as having any causal responsibility for the deaths and suffering of others. Part of you might reason: I just sit at a computer and work with people. Godwin's Law Invokation: I don't care if you are an errand boy, salesperson, team leader, project manager, or CEO; it's wrong to knowingly be a Nazi at any level in the foodchain.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">na</sup></button> You might not pull the trigger, but your job is to enable others to do so.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ra</sup></button> </p><p>Obviously, you are only one of many employees. You aren't the only one responsible, but you are certainly responsible. As you have recognized, you are a leader in that company. You are actively seeking to help Humana succeed in their evil task. That's evil. Unfortunately, it must be said: just because you get paid to do something doesn't make it right. You don't have to work there. You really have had a choice and still do. Whether or not you continue to work for Humana is up to you. </p><p>You've talked with me about finding a new job for quite a while, though perhaps mostly in terms of climbing ladders in Humana. You seem to think you are a failure in engineering; it feels like you've given up on that dream. I will continue to reaffirm the pursuit of engineering, but I realize that might not be where you want to go in the end. I cannot tell you where to go, but I can tell you that you should not stay with Humana. Don't delude yourself into claiming this is an issue of competence, time, or self-confidence: it's an issue of integrity. Own up to the fact that you shouldn't work at your current position or any position at Humana for that matter. When your moral identity is at stake, I'm convinced you will find the courage to take the leap somewhere else.</p><p>You aren't in a bad position here. You have minimal dependencies and significant amounts of free time after your telecommuted job. You still have some connections to work within the area too. You have an engineering degree, an MBA, softskills, and work experience while living in a metropolis. You are in demand, and a transition is totally doable. Don't hold yourself back. Take this opportunity to leap into engineering. Even if that doesn't work out, jump into some other position at another company. Flee from the evil you are doing. Yes, you really can find another job, and I think you would be much happier for it to boot. I'm generally a pessimist, but even I'm optimistic in your ability to switch gears, move away from Humana, and find a job which is moral and even more satisfying to you.</p><p>Of course, I have only presented an argument (perhaps audaciously). Clearly, I must be open to being wrong here and elsewhere. I'm a fallible and hypocritical philosopher. As I said, this may require some wrestling. If you think I'm wrong, I have a right to hear why. I will carefully think about your counterarguments. </p><p>I fear you may find my words so painful you will confabulate reasons to dismiss me or my argument because it destabilizes your self-image or mental health. Here is an unfun fact: you shouldn't be mentally stable when you are doing evil. It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">mh</sup></button> The adjustment may require <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Positive%2520Disintegration.html">Positive Disintegration</a>.</p><p>I will remind you that even you have &quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="2019.02.14%2520-%2520L%253A%2520Morally%2520Questionable.html">come to Jesus</a>&quot; talks with your friends.
