FRI 12:47 PM
How's the weekend going?
9 HR AGO
Adam and I have both been sick this weekend, but it wasn't too bad because he took off work for the first time maybe ever and we've been sneezing and watching movies on the couch. It's been fun. Apart from all the tissues, haha.
5 HR AGO
Lol. That sounds terrible and wonderful.
5 HR AGO
I like your idea of the book tiddler. There's a series I'm buddy reading with a friend and lord I've got some feelings to process about it. The tiddler might be good for that.
5 HR AGO
We watched The Witch (stylized as The VVitch) last night. Have you ever seen it?
5 HR AGO
I've never even heard of it.
5 HR AGO
What do you like about it?
5 HR AGO
There were so many different things. One, it was so different from anything else I've ever seen, which is such a broad and kind of bland way to describe something, but this movie really was. It is a supernatural horror set in the early 1600s with the Puritans. The dialogue is all period appropriate but good lord they do SUCH a good job with it. It's so easy to understand and after a while you forget they're saying thees and thous and all that. Religion plays such a huge part, an actual concrete role in the film and isn't used as a backdrop/dressing because of the time period. I don't know if the director grew up Calvinist or religious at all but the characters aren't given being religious as an explicit negative character trait. It's not a preachy movie or even necessarily positive toward religion but it felt like to me the director made this conscious choice of, &quot;Okay, in this time period, this is what my characters would believe. Let me get in their head space and understand them.&quot; 

It's one of those movies where almost nothing happens until the end. The soundtrack was butt puckeringly terrifying. 

The whole thing just felt so careful and well-crafted. 

I hesitate to recommend you watch it though because there are some rough scenes with the children. It might not be an issue though? I'm very sensitive to gore and any kind of physical harm in movies, and I didn't have any problem with this movie. But, I'm also not a parent, so those parts of my heart could just very well be dormant, lol.
5 HR AGO
Lol. Thank you for explaining. I will ask [[k0sh3k]] if she wants to watch.
5 HR AGO
This is also something we could talk about over the wiki!
5 HR AGO
I would love that!
5 HR AGO
Also, somewhat random but you're the only person I trust to actually think about this question fully and to give a real answer:

How familiar are you with Ted Bundy and his general story?
5 HR AGO
That's not the question, btw.
5 HR AGO
I'm leading up to it.
5 HR AGO
I am only vaguely familiar. Dude was a quintessential dark-triad to me.
5 HR AGO
To the point that he is almost a caricature of psychopathy, extreme enough now that people don't realize psychopathy is a spectrum.
4 HR AGO
(Also, [[The Gervais Principle]] and Political Ponerology are amazing books!
4 HR AGO
)
4 HR AGO
Okay, so there's a movie coming out about Ted Bundy, I believe through the point of view of his girlfriend at the time. Here's the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v38MNmDcgrM

There are a lot of people who are upset that there's a movie being made and that the trailer seems so lighthearted (I think that's a stretch). One person's comment stuck out to me. They said something along the lines of how perverse it is to make a movie about someone evil. 

I'll give it to them that this movie will clearly focus on Bundy and, I imagine, give little emotional real estate to the victims.
4 HR AGO
But then I realized I was fine with that.
4 HR AGO
Then I wondered if that's okay.
4 HR AGO
That is a huge question to try to answer. What is the good for the sake of which any movie is made?
4 HR AGO
What are the moral requirements of movies or any form of communication in general?
4 HR AGO
The answer seems to particularize to a context.
4 HR AGO
I have to be reductive and guess.
4 HR AGO
I think the buddy heist film vibe of the trailer makes sense given that Bundy was so fucking charming. I think it was something like 50% of people didn't believe he did it? I may be making that number up. Bundy was hot and smooth talking, the movie needs to put the audience in the head space for that. 

The more I'm saying the more I realize I need to specify the question. 

I like what you asked, what are the moral requirements of a film. I think that's what I want to know. Are there any?
4 HR AGO
I don't think there is anything conceptually wrong with the movie. Art has to be that open. I am radically opposed to censorship (to an extreme degree).
4 HR AGO
From a political perspective, we have to open. That said, just because you have a political right to communicate something doesn't give you the moral right (which is the only kind of right that matters in the end).
4 HR AGO
There are differences between the claims, do I have the moral rights to: &quot;create this,&quot; &quot;distribute this,&quot; &quot;watch this,&quot; &quot;use this for purpose X,&quot; &quot;hold opinion Y about this&quot;?
4 HR AGO
Do I think you are being immoral for watching that movie? No.
4 HR AGO
Are there some people who might be immoral in watching it? Of course. Being a good reader is part of being a good author of our lives. Some people might really be watching that movie to be entertained rather than informed and transformed by empathy.
4 HR AGO
There are some producers of that film who are doing it for fame and fortune and without any respect for the moral law. They have the wrong moral motivation, and hence the act isn't a right one.
4 HR AGO
There are contexts and possible worlds in which every person should always make that film, and other possible worlds in which no one should create it.
4 HR AGO
Are the consequentialist reasons we must take into account in the weighings and computations necessary to answer those various Hohfeldian moral obligations/rights questions? Yes.
4 HR AGO
I don't think you have immoral motivations, and I think there are non-trivial consequentialist reasons you should watch it.
4 HR AGO
Are there con...*
4 HR AGO
I had never thought about there being equal responsibility on consumers of art, not just the artist.
4 HR AGO
I agree we are responsible. I cannot say it is equal. I also do not wish to imply the Neo-Liberal lie that &quot;we must vote with our wallets&quot; to solve the world's problems (as though average people are the real problems; it is a form of gaslighting).
4 HR AGO
Do elaborate. I'm interested in this.
4 HR AGO
I think the elite have a non-trivial hand in cultivating and perpetuating a memeplex in the minds of the human species which places the blame of the plight of the poor on the poor themselves. Most of the blame for their impoverishment, imho, rests with those in power to contribute to a society that morally does something about it. I consider that kind of gaslighting to be a form of Prosperity Gospel teaching.
