I am very proud of my recognition of what I'm trying to accomplish on this wiki. This log has helped me understand so much about my goals of autonomy.</li><li>I started out writing quite a bit more about each item on the list.</li><li>My audit procedure came the second month. Revelation, as I said.</li><li>Seldon, I was incredibly verbose initially. It died out.</li><li>I see lots of To-Do-List work in there.</li><li>One interesting aspect is how I get to see myself hop from project to project. I wish I knew the projects that merited pouring myself entirely into. Executive function problems show themselves here.</li><li>You can tell when I've been extremely busy or overwhelmed. It shows up very clearly in my reviews. </li><li>I am constantly searching for every drop of chemical joy I can find. It never ends. Hedonic treadmill. I need to find a way off (a constructive one), if that is even possible (I daresay it isn't).</li><li>A ton of work here is also a variant of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Wiki%2520Audit%2520Log.html">Wiki Audit Log</a>. Perhaps they really do belong together. They do seem to do something very similar. I really should consider merging them. I'm not sure how though.<ul><li>Hmmm. This is tricky. I think they peel apart too clearly for me to put them together. It's fine that they have some overlapping functionality. The core of what they are attempting to do is just different.</li></ul></li><li>By July, commentary started to taper off. I feel like I jumped into the practice and than slowly coasted into the auto-posting I have today. That may be the wrong attitude.</li><li>I really haven't found things worth tracking mathematically. Everything is story.</li><li>This is a raw flood of information. It's insane. It captures so much.</li><li>I love how much encouragement I give myself in this log. This is where I am meta in a daily way.</li><li>I have clearly struggled with my diet for quite a while. It has been a process, but I've lost a reasonable amount of weight. I dropped from 250 to 200 in the matter of a year or so, although it keeps climbing back up. I fight it! Good job.</li><li>I'm not sure how useful this log is to me in a long-term sense, although I see the obvious value of it in a short-term sense. Well, even long-term effects break down into small effects.</li><li>It is so obvious that I have worked my ass off this year. This log is dizzying. By Seldon, I've done a ton of work.</li><li>Ah, August show a decline in my commentary. I have been worried about it, of course. I need to think more about the extent to which this is bad. Sometimes, it seems like it. Sometimes, I don't know which of my thoughts and comments will be the valuable ones. It is time consuming. I need to be able to come up with what is salient without as much waste.</li><li>At the very least, this has been an incredible accountability tool. It's kind of insane. Forcing myself to look at my work, to even think about it briefly, to perhaps edit it when it strikes me, etc. However brief my responses may be, it still means something. Half the work is the reading, not the responding.</li><li>I had a very difficult time working on the wiki when I was at Eastman. All the hacks.</li><li>I'm not sure how effectively I chose my books. I can see that I'm unhappy with my curation.</li><li>I cried a lot.</li><li>Oh wow, I have come an insanely long way since September. This wiki has been transformed, radically. Those ideas really did come to fruition.</li><li>I see the decline of my interest in pipefitting. It doesn't suit us where we are. It sucks.</li><li>Ah, I see that asking my wife to edit wasn't a good idea. Only those pages which will be permanent and reusable deserve it.</li><li>I see the end of my job. Wowsers, it is an explosion on this wiki.</li><li>The wiki is transforming. It's rapid.</li><li>I made a ton of long-term design decisions.</li><li>I regret playing video games other than this one. Gah!</li><li>I have some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="SO.html">SO</a> work, but it stopped. That was transferred to the wiki audit to some extent.</li><li>I want to say, good job on planning. I need to do more of it. I feel like I'm just keeping my head above water in consuming my daily thoughts. Trying to think about the future is hard, and I am not doing it enough. Do I need to make a log more specifically about it?</li><li>It's weird, but I think this log is actually a testing grounds and a seed for the wiki. It's kind of a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="%252Fb%252F.html">/b/</a> for {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Principles.html">Principles</a>} in a way.</li><li>It has been a monumental effort to audit this wiki. There is so much. There are also so many practices I'm trying to introduce. It's a lot to take in. It's not an easy object to swallow, and couldn't be more evident in this log.</li><li>I'm obsessed with triaging. I think that is extremely practical.</li><li>Ah, I finally see the title.Titles come alive in November</li><li>This has been a year of anxiety, and I have made lemonade.</li><li>I'm so glad I have this log to point out my emotional imbalances. Sometimes it is the best place to express it.</li><li>By the end of year, I have a lot of one word replies. hrmm..</li><li>This log shows the skeleton of my narrative in a way that nothing else does. It's so much to swallow.</li><li>I'm coming to terms with my mental illness, whatever it is, or I'm trying to. I've been thinking about it for quite a while.</li><li>I clearly spent another 2 months more than I thought on it. Was that a mistake? I should ask my wife. Perhaps only time will tell.</li><li>It was interesting to reconnect with Snow. We both clearly had it on our minds.</li><li>It's hard to fathom how much I've added to this monster. It has been snowballing. Rabbitholing is the right word. It's disorienting.</li><li>The mindmapping process is coalescing. It's a messy, organic process. I worry that it will sprawl without reason. I need to make sure I build crystallized structures over time, as much as is necessary.</li><li>I was very worried about completing {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>}. It was time to re-write it, and I was anxious about it. I'm really proud of my work.</li><li>I'm 99% most people would consider this work to be that of a madman. Lol. I can't say they are wrong, but I also can't say this is the wrong thing to do. Perhaps you have to be a bit crazy to appreciate the value and reasonableness of what I'm trying to accomplish.</li><li>These past few months have enabled me to revamp how much children do schoolwork. We keep building towards this habit.</li><li>Ugh, I am disappointed it the gutturality of these responses. I need to actually tell a story, not just my feelings.</li><li>The technical transition has taken about a month and a half. We're still undergoing it.<ul><li>It has been wonderful to see all of my family members pitching in and taking responsibility for their machines and data.</li></ul></li><li>Okay, I will admit many of my jokes still make me laugh and smile. I still want to be more serious than I have been. This is not a joke!</li><li>There is an oscillatory pattern here. I can only dive for so long. I have to come back up for air. I can see that I'm tired of working on the wiki, often enough.</li><li>I can see that I talk about almost all of these points throughout the year. Many of them I didn't solve. I can see there are limits to the extent that I actually listen to myself. I am only partially plastic and autonomous, in a sense. That is okay. You did a good job with what you have.</li><li>I think is exceptionally interesting that I don't feel compelled to re-write the directory page for this log. I think it is in remarkably good shape.</li><li>Lastly, homie, good fucking job! I'm so proud of you.</li></ul></div>
