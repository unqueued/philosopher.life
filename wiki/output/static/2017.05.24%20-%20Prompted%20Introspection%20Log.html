<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>I forgot to write one last night. Oops. So, I'm making up for it this morning.</em></p><h2 class="">How would you like to die?</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden's mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty.</p><p>‚ÄìTyrion &quot;the Imp&quot; Lannister, Game of Thrones
</p></blockquote><p>The assumption, of course, is that I'm going to die. That's a safe assumption. Maybe I could live on in some computer as a program or with robotic parts, but I highly doubt that will come to pass (even if it were possible). </p><p>What obtains at the time of my death? Is that what you are really asking? Do you know what you are asking?</p><p>Like so many of my answers, I think this one requires context. &quot;How I would like to die&quot; is strongly tied to how I have lived. Tell me how I have lived, and I'll tell you the when what, where, what, who, how, etc. of my preferred death. The basic answer might appear to be &quot;old and happy,&quot; however, there are plenty of scenarios in which I'd say &quot;young and quickly,&quot; and others where &quot;slow and painful&quot; death would be a worthy sacrifice. The state of the world is key to answering this question. Working backward, we might say that in answering this question, we are really talking about how I would like to live. </p><p>Ummm... I'd like everyone to be maximally and permanently happy when I die of &quot;natural&quot; causes in my sleep at an old age after having completed my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Bucketlist.html">Bucketlist</a>. Done. </p><p>Oh, that's not realistic? You mean I need a <em>realistic</em> answer. Well, I happen to think there is a much larger difference between the way the world <em>is</em> and the way it <em>ought to be</em>. I actually think we could, theoretically, achieve world peace, enriched lives, and live in harmony. I would virtually never, ever predict it though. </p><p>Oh adversary, tell me what counts as realistic.</p><p>Maybe you are asking: Of those possible worlds that I see as not being just merely possible but also plausible, which of them do I wish to obtain? Of course, I must ask, how plausible? You have to nail this down for me. In charity, should I take up what I believe is most likely to occur and then give the most strategic answer in light of that context?</p><p>I believe the end of human existence is coming. I think billions are going to suffer and die by our own hands. I assume remnants will survive, but I don't think our species will be able to rebuild. We've harvested the surface of our planet in such a way that there aren't any do-overs. It will be a true blight on our planet's geological record. </p><p>I think finding a safe place to help my children live meaningful lives while the world crumbles around us, enslaving each other, is our best option. I hope I'm wrong. If I'm wrong, then there are many other options. This is the problem with such a defensive option; your opportunity costs are fairly high. I wish I could be more optimistic. Maybe in time that will change. Who knows? Maybe I'm wrong about what is plausible. </p><p>Ah, you still don't like my answer? Are you asking something far simpler: forget the state of the world, your life, etc., what is your preferred method or direct cause of your death?</p><p>I'd prefer it was painless. I want to go out doing something I would never do as a person who wants to live: I want to OD on Heroin when medical care is beyond helping me. I want my last moments to be pure bliss. </p></div>
