I'm uploading my mind into this modeling model, and it's not easy to read or write. You'll need a strong stomach and a lot of time to dig into the intertwangliness of my self-representation; it's a lot like learning <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hlexicon.html">new language</a>s or finding order in fragmented adhocracies.

You will pay a high cost to charitably interpret my prolix signs.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pr</sup></button> Further, I readily admit it's painful to parse my deranged, crackpot thoughts conveyed in execrable writing. So, I agree it may easily not be worth reading for you. </p><p>I apologize for your inconveniences, confusion, and any negative feelings I've stirred in you. It is not my intention to waste your time (or mine) or treat you unfairly. Reading my semblance of my representation of my mind (itself a semblance) is a ridiculous burden.

As peculiar as it may be, I'm representing myself to myself in public for Kantian reasons. As best as I can, I'm morally obligated to virtuously virtue signal to myself in the sunlight, to open source becoming an objectively (or even just intersubjectively) less shitty self-debugger each day. Feel free to hold me to it, stranger.</p><p>This wiki is intentionally built on the principle of pursuing radical transparency, honesty, integrity, literality, openness, and accepting that I am <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a>. This work is designed to be the opposite of impenetrable! I continually prove to myself that thinking out loud is a valuable use of my time and energy. Further, in finding myself and my Humanity, I'm iteratively coming to better realize both <em>that</em> and <em>how</em> I must <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">Find The Others</a>. Thus, I'm not just trying to model my self-modeling to myself merely for myself, but also model it to and for you. That's largely why this introductory page exists.</p><p>You should know: I'm a high-functioning autistic person who can't pass for normal, and even those who know me extremely well regularly have difficulty making sense of this wiki. Obviously, even I fail to effectively reason about my own work like a hypocrite, but that's not by design.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ef</sup></button> </p><p>Yes, to many <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a>, I am delusionally blind to reality (and so are you). My goal isn't to be obscure or convoluted, but I know personal writing at this level will be like that. I'm sincerely sorry. Please, take the time to consider that that I'm doing my best (or at least near my best) in this wiki given what I have. </p><p>Let me assure you, nomad, if you had one, your wiki would be very messy, incomplete, and idiosyncratic as well. Creating an effective linguistic lens-crafting tool is not easy when you're as blind as I am. With that in mind, I am always open to suggestions and arguments (feel free to {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Contact.html">Contact</a>} me). </p><p>Sometimes, I may ignorantly fail to understand your kindness to me, but I hope to never maliciously fail.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">mi</sup></button> I will be forever indebted to you for justifiably explaining to me how I am a blind or insane hypocrite who doesn't practice what he preaches, but please make sure you've taken the time to at least try to understand where I'm coming from before launching into a diatribe.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">dt</sup></button></p><p>My project is beyond enormous, and it is difficult for me to organize, navigate, and model by definition (it's only going to get harder too!). I've not carefully measured it, but my guesstimate is that the wiki is equivalent in wordcount to ~15ish 250-page books (by the end of the second year). It's not easy to consume or reason about this much content, and I will probably be the only non-cyborgic human to ever read it all (and I hope multiple times over at that).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ai</sup></button></p><p>This wiki's organizational structure and content are incestuously and delusionally biased. To <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="infinigress.html">infinigress</a>, I can never escape the recursively biased way in which a biased version of me biasedly tells and retells my biased stories and self-representations of my biased self/selves to my biased IRL self/selves. It is my plight: I can only <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="hope.html">hope</a> to subjectively aim to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> improve my identity (and my process of improvement) to become objectively better. Judge me wisely, nomad.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not giving up on objectivity (far from it!), but I must stoically admit what is outside my immediate control. There is a level at which I can't immediately change it (and aspects which may never be in my control). Ought implies can, thus I can only be responsible and ashamed for so much. It takes time, and I can only refactor some of my mutable perceptions to some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> in any given context. Further, in exercising <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Golden%2520Rule.html">The Golden Rule</a>, I ask you to consider the possibility that some of the interpretive work (both exegetical and eisegetical) must be born on your backs. </p><p>I'm not only often wrong, but even when I'm correct, I am all too often simply too stupid or inarticulate to explain or justify my thoughts; I can only wall-of-text point like a neanderthal.

Alas, I can only do my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="fff.html">fff</a> best, and thus you will have to do yours as well.</p><p>I would like to point out the sidebar, which is immensely useful for staying current. The &quot;New&quot; tab shows newly created pages (sometimes referred to as tiddlers). &quot;Recent&quot; includes not only those newly created, but also those recently edited. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Hub.html">Hub</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Pin.html">Pin</a> tabs are extremely important to how I use this wiki; it will be worth your time to think about it, imho.</p><p>Also, since I write this for myself, I try to primarily pay attention to how it looks on my screen. If you want to replicate my view, I'm using Firefox on Linux at 1920x1080 resolution on a 42&quot; screen (it's very easy on my eyes). Also, I suggest reading the wiki in full screen to get the same phenomenological effect. There's a full-screen button in the top right corner. For some browsers, you can just F11. </p><p>As a side note to another technical annoyance you may experience, I'm sure it would annoy many computational minimalists that I willingly store virtually the entire site in a single self-editing html file (it makes it excellent for offline reading too). I'll grant that text files alone have something going for them, but this is a very special tool. This wiki is incredibly portable, functional, and malleable (while also being dead easy to use). I consider Tiddlywiki to be a skeuomorphic feat of software engineering (analogously, in time, I hope you will see the content of the wiki as doing something just as brilliant in creating an IDE for itself). How many virtually complete websites with this degree of functionality and content can you download in tens of megabytes? I think there is profound minimalist beauty to it. So, yeah, the initial load times aren't great, but you can always just sync it instead.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> Ultimately, the unity of this artwork, even from a technical perspective, is part of its aesthetic (there are number of other tools I could use instead).</p><p>Be sure to click on the (i) icon to see tiddler references and other metadata.

It is the most important page on this wiki to me. It is my existential anchor and quintessential narrative of who I take myself to be.

</p></blockquote><hr><h2 class="">Focus:</h2><p>At this point, you probably think I'm insufferably arrogant and batshit crazy (you may be right).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">sq</sup></button> For a variety of reasons, I must talk to those who know me best, and that's why I'm often forced to talk with myself in whatever ways I can. I understand that I endanger myself by being so brutally honest. I'm sorry if my openness and half-finished work makes you uncomfortable, feels disturbingly overwrought to you, disgusts you, or causes you to lose your empathy. </p><p>Further, I feel compelled to explain what may seem like an odd inconsistency in my approach to privacy and anonymity throughout this wiki. Namely, I care so much about privacy and anonymity as political rights, and yet I have essentially no privacy here while maintaining only the thinnest veil of anonymity.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">pv</sup></button> </p><p>My cringeworthy oversharing is absurdly public; I know. To that I say: well, this is my outlet ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø, an effective conduit between myselves, and there is a method to the madness. This is me putting my money where my mouth is. Madman and/or mystic, the reason for transparently and openly shaping myself: sunlight is the best disinfectant. This is a fundamental application of the radically forgiving trust-building strategy of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T42T.html">T42T</a>. In learning to hypothetically teach others about myself, I'm openly learning how to teach myself to teach myself about myself.</p><p>Of course, I'm not saying anyone but me really cares about this wiki; it's pretty obvious to me that only a few individuals do. My thoughts may mean nothing to you, but they mean everything to me. Importantly, even if I might be speaking out in the dark with nobody there to listen, it would still be a good thing that I'm speaking out in the dark. Whether I'm talking to a void, myself, or other, acting as if someone is reading this or may be reading this somehow puts me in the right mindset; an ordered sunlight emerges from the chaotic darkness. It feels like I'm addressing an audience instead of myself, and that helps me better realize how and when I need to be clearer, more rational, and more empathic. It forces me into a mode of public reasoning where I hopefully more fairly and objectively negotiate, integrate, and reprogram myself. This is an experiment in public consciousness that helps me filter myself, pierce my filter-bubbles, overcome those paranoid tendencies of mine which are maladaptive, and refactor my perceptions in the daylight rather than the shadows. Even if nobody is listening to me, I should listen to the right parts of myself in an artificially induced public sphere.</p><p>Essentially, this wiki is an accountability-based, high-transparency, cryptographically verifiable implementation of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a>.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ci</sup></button> Everything I say here can and will be used against me. I have to ask myself in a space of actual public reasoning (not merely the hypothetical possible worlds or moral courtrooms we enter into in our internal instantiations of the Categorical Imperative) if this is who I ought to be, if this is what I ought to do, if rational persons <em>in my position </em>would agree to my claims, acts, and intentions. Think about it: if we all wrote our journals and shaped ourselves in public, wouldn't the world be a better place and wouldn't people in general be better people? I am no exception. So, while I respect privacy rights (and find them exceedingly necessary for our world), I'm electing to relinquish mine because I feel compelled by practical wisdom applied in my context. </p><p>Assisted by technology, perhaps I'm one of the most open <strike>books</strike> wikis in human history so far. I might look stupid and even be truly hated for who I am. In a sense of instrumental necessity to my ends, that's okay. Alienation is sometimes the cost of righteousness. Sometimes it takes courage to accept being hated.</p><p>The practical point is this: I want to construct my narrative, edit my reality map, and shape my personality in a public setting directly because it's much harder to confabulate &quot;reasons&quot; to irrational <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="dok.html">dok</a> of selfishness (or other mistakes) when people are paying attention.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">eo</sup></button> Intellectual and moral integrity is all about trying to apply standards we believe rational people independent of us would accept and use.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ry</sup></button> This is an application of the golden rule, of loving wisdom (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Virtue%2520is%2520Knowledge.html">Virtue is Knowledge</a>), and essentially, of empathizing with the ideally-ideal hypothetical intersubjective interpretation of the objectively rational and the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Good.html">The Good</a> itself.</p><p>Wherever this hermeneutic spiral takes me, as part of this continual existential process of rebirthing and reawakening, I will engage in the practice of programming myself and my reality. There is a line of continuous identity in that spiral, and I will be it. My goal is to be autonomous and authentic. I want to be my own programmer. I want to be the author of my life. I want to be the legislator of my own laws (literally what autonomy means). I want to be free and happy. I'm here to fight for that freedom and to stoically accept in empathy what I can't control. </p><p>Needless to say, this messy wiki is currently (and hopefully often and always) under construction. Expect wiki-pages to be created, edited, and removed.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">cy</sup></button> This wiki is a living document (for metaliving). Since I change, so will my wiki. The organization of this wiki is constantly in flux as I try to reposition and construct the jigsaw pieces of my reality map. </p><p>Problematically, I am often wrong. Do you hear me? <em><strong><u>Listen</u></strong></em>: <strong>I am going to be wrong on this wiki because I am often wrong IRL.</strong> The whole point of the wiki is to help me distinguish what is right from what is wrong. Be gracious! Be empathic! Be understanding! You can't be perfect (no one can), even though you should strive to be. Please understand the wiki as an <em>evolving</em> thing (just like our lives). Do your best (paradoxically, who doesn't?).</p><p>To only add confusion to the problem: I often fail to say what I really mean, I don't know what I mean to say, and much of my work looks like a redundant hand-waving jumble. I'm sorry. I am a poor communicator faced with serious interpersonal barriers and logistical challenges on top of unavoidable postmodern problematics. </p><p>Obviously, there are the expected flaws in the isomorphism. No matter how hard I try, I feel like sometimes I'm experiencing something (semantic implication, ‚ä®) which I cannot reach or express deductively (syntactic implication, ‚ä¢). I fear I face a transcendental divide, an existential incompleteness epistemology-entailing-language problem wherein I conceptually (in all possible worlds) cannot verbally achieve the following: A‚ä®B‚áíA‚ä¢B.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">ss</sup></button> There is a cost in being well-versed in myself, and I can't always pay it by definition; you might say I cannot fully simulate my mind in my mind. This is only one member of a class of philosophical problems involved in interpreting my own writing, some of the larger problematics become more obvious when we switch from the analytic tradition to the continental.</p><p>I am worried that privatizing my language too far makes it useless or inaccessible to others (and perhaps even eventually myself). Please see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="h0p3's%2520Lexicon.html">h0p3's Lexicon</a> to help you interpret my project. In a practical sense, I must break my own autistic code and untangle the web for myself before I could hope to decode it for others. In an ideal sense, even if only via implementing the CI, I'm trying to explain myself to others by treating myself as The Other <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="irwartfrr.html">irwartfrr</a>.</p><p>It is not always easy to unpack interpretations of my word suitcases. Given this, I have no doubt most people would dismiss my work as the apocryphal ravings of an arrogant lunatic (or worse). At the very least, my adversaries would accuse me of replacing profundity with verbosity. I apologize for my matrix raining wall-of-texts; I do not mean to bloviate anymore than is necessary to understand the problem. I apologize if this feels like you have to do all the work in assembling the bits of meaning into a coherent whole (because I can't claim to have done the same for myself with this tool thus far). I also realize that not speaking my language or not being able to swallow the unconventionality of this wiki makes you more likely to fail to empathize in the minimal <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="T4T.html">T4T</a> trust tests of trading social capital and cognitive costs of understanding each other. I will do my best not to blame you, and I hope you can do the same for me. </p><p>It is possible that others will find me intimately unrelatable, lamentably unlaymenlike, authentically unbelievable, and a prime example of what not to emulate. My disclosure may disgust you. Maybe this is just another timecube to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">tc</sup></button> It's true that if you don't like my wiki, you don't like me.

If we must, I suppose we can set aside the desire for each other's approval or validation as kindly as we can. It's true, we can't please everyone. I suppose I can only hope that we learn to empathize with each other in our agreement to disagree. Hopefully, I will <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Find%2520The%2520Others.html">find one of The Others</a> in you or among you.
