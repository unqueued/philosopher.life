<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">How is your health? Daily routine? </h2><p>Doing fine. I slept terribly last night, but this is as it always is with DCK. I will sleep quite well tonight. k0sh3k is also very sleepy. We stayed up late (11:15) to finish our family meeting last night (although, I couldn't sleep until about 3:00, and even then only half-brainededly). Everyone was sleepy, including the children.</p><hr><h2 class="">What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?</h2><p>Despite being a long day yesterday, it was a wonderful day. I really enjoyed bonding with my family. My children have been asking for a while to play a game with me. I brought out the magic cards and taught them. I've given MUC to 1uxb0x and Affinity to j3d1h. I talked about my history with these cards, what they meant to me, what it would take to learn to play it, etc. It was a blast for us all. I ended up playing different decks against them to give them a quick sampling. My favorite game was with 1uxb0x since I decided to play MWC against his MUC. It was truly an epic control vs control matchup.</p><hr><h2 class="">Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. </h2><p>DCK has been quite effective. I'm trying to make my children's lives easier and more interesting by integrating myself more directly into their lives. This is a lot easier when I am not responsible for holding them accountable. When I can just be their friend, it is miles easier for us all, more productive, and we're all happier.</p><p>I've been doing the kitchen with my kids. While they can and even perhaps should do it themselves, this model seems to work better in many ways. I want to be side-by-side with them.</p><p>Honestly, I have no idea if they want to play magic with me. I'm not always very fun to play games with. I gave them what they asked for, or so it seems. Perhaps they are asking for something else. We will clarify it.</p><hr><h2 class="">What are you going to do about what happened?</h2><p>Enjoy my time with my family, particularly while I still have it.</p></div>
