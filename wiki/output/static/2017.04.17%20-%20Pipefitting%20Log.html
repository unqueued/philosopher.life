<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Today was an interesting day. At this point, everyone has either graduate or moved onto co-op, except TJ, Nash, Chris, and myself. It is very quiet. Nash is lagging behind, but not too far. He continues to play catchup enough that he will probably stay with us in testing. Interestingly, we took the same test as TJ today. Obviously, we've been flying because even TJ is ahead of where he should be. The teacher meant to help us study but only helped us in about 2/3's of the test. It's a good thing I read the chapter entirely. That's 2/9 tests for this book now.</p><p>We didn't do anything (besides my sweeping) in the shop today. Instead, after the exam, we spent all of today going over buttweld math. My teacher said that next week he'd had a new class come in, and he'd be very busy with them. This allows us to work without his attention. I know we just started socket welds, but we're due to finish them asap (I'm going to bet he'll have us actually start on them a couple weeks into the 2nd trimester, despite the claim it would be on the nose...we'll see though). There is more trig to do, but nothing complicated. There is more to lookup, but it all makes sense. I'm very glad we did the stainless steel work. It immediately allowed me to understand what we were doing in fabricating our joints. The cool part of buttwelds is that you can do any kind of angle you want. I see why it would probably be the most useful of the 3 kinds of piping I've learned. It's very versatile, and I'm going to bet that with good welds, it may even be the strongest. I'll have to look that up. </p><p>After learning math and working through some practical examples, I asked my teacher if CAD programs did the math for this (because they easily could). My concern was that this process would and should be automated. Essentially, the mathematical reasoning could easily be cut out of this job, in a sense, at the engineering stage. He laughed and said that plenty of ISOs come with the cut lengths already. He says that he checks them anyway because he still finds errors. Furthermore, engineers tend to work with much older as-built drawings instead of using the current building (and whatever changes and additions have been made) to create their drawings. By lacking accurate information, engineers tend to draw things which aren't possible or feasible to build because things are different, in the way, etc. </p><p>My teacher said that about 30% of the drawings on a job will have zero flaws and require no red-line modifications in the field. That is an absurd engineering failure rate! But, that means that my job probably won't be automated in this respect, at least not yet. Having someone on the ground capable of doing the engineering on the spot is clearly very useful. Thus, he was not worried at all about it. It's simply more feasible for an engineer to pass the buck to the pipefitter by requiring &quot;F.V.&quot; or field verification, which essentially requires the pipefitter to fix whatever is wrong with the drawing to implement the more general gameplan. </p></div>
