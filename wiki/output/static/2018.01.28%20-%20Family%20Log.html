They have your phone number, they can text, they have your e-mail address, and now they have your XMPP account too. You should reach out to them, but also recognize they should reach out to you. Relationships are a two-way street. I want you to know, if they don't spend time communicating with you, it is not your fault.</li><li>I know getting your hair cut wasn't easy for you, and I'm glad you accepted. I think you are already starting to live and love it. That's a good skill to have.

You are aiming for the spirit of the law and not merely the letter of the law. You're practically shaming me as an accountabilibuddy. I want to live up to the same standard you're applying to yourself too.
