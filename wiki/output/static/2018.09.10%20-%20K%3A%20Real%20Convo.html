 Doing now

 I appreciate it [[h0p3]]. &gt;_&lt; How are you doing today?
11 hours ago
 Doing well. Unfortunately, making people sad/angry on the internet (which is not my intention).
11 hours ago
 So, thinking about that.

 Reddit? Emoji image of 'joy'
11 hours ago
 People on reddit are assholes.
11 hours ago
 lol
11 hours ago
 nope, from my wiki. I've been in correspondence with many folks through it
11 hours ago
 But, yeah, lots of assholes on Reddit
11 hours ago
 After the explosion post Digg fiasco, downvote became dislikes. A lot of mature conversational ranking tools disappeared. It became the mediocrity of democratic mob rule.

 It's easier on smaller subs

 Can't find the book. =/
11 hours ago
 I often fail to find Norton's books
11 hours ago
 Ugh. That sucks.... thanks for checking for me. I HATE those Norton books. XD
11 hours ago
 I‚Äôve just stopped caring if I upset people online tbh. I‚Äôm nice to strangers upfront until they give me a reason not to.
11 hours ago
 I attempt to cooperate through at least one failure to cooperate on their part, then I ignore.
11 hours ago
 That sounds like how I rile people up when we‚Äôre raiding with randos. Emoji image of 'joy'

 Keyboard courage is an awful thing.
11 hours ago
 I wish there was a way to circumvent it.
11 hours ago
 Building virtual community in which we are not physically reminded of our vulnerability, where we don't have the affective instincts to empathize (relying heavily on the cognitive), is a difficult problem. It's not going away either.
11 hours ago
 I‚Äôm trying really hard to thicken my skin when it comes to dealing with volatile people because I‚Äôm truthfully a very sensitive person and I tend to overreact to things that aren‚Äôt that big a deal.
11 hours ago
 I believe sensitivity is empirically (and conceptually) linked to intelligence. I don't think your sensitivity is a bad thing at all, although I appreciate the need to defend yourself with thick skin in the appropriate contexts. I'm not terribly good at knowing how to be vulnerable to others in the right way.
8 hours ago
 My own personal rule of thumb is to prioritize honesty and tact at the same time. I can‚Äôt find a good balance between the two. But I also believe that vulnerability is what made my relationship with [[L]] work. It wasn‚Äôt until a few years into our relationship that could even share emotions and problems with her. Bottling things up is an awful thing to do. Emoji image of 'skull_and_crossbones'

 Ha, I hear that.

 Same dude. If I went back in time, the first thing I would do is slap the shit out of myself. Emoji image of 'sweat_smile'</code></pre></div>
