Hey, how goes it?
DEC 4 12:56 PM
Been almost a week. How are you? =)
DEC 9 12:42 PM
Hey [[L]], how are you doing?
MON 9:40 AM
...I swear my phone skips notifications sometimes. Hi [[h0p3]]!!
MON 12:15 PM
It’s been a week, let me tell you.
MON 12:16 PM
=) Hey [[L]]
MON 12:19 PM
Well, tell me!
MON 12:19 PM
Our conversations are my chance to read your wiki, lol. I'm grateful for the chance to hear about your week.
MON 12:21 PM
[[K]] and I are realizing we need to say “no” to more things because we’re stretching ourselves far too thin. Starting to try and do that now, so we can ACTUALLY give people the time they deserve rather than being too worried about everything else to enjoy their company.

Stuff with Chase has finally come to a head. He got everything sorted out too late it seems. Financial aid basically told him “yeah sorry, you may not even be awarded the money because it’s already December and it won’t go through till January” (which is when second semester stuff kicks in). He’s basically failed all his classes because he didn’t attend and didn’t have the stupid codes he needed to do the homework (grades are another reason he may not be awarded financial aid too). And since he owes the school money, he can’t register for classes. Since he can’t register for classes, his dorm is kicking him out. 

Yesterday we had a real-talk conversation with [[K]]’s parents and siblings and... it went well enough. His mom got upset because basically every older boy BUT [[K]] has something going on right now. Austin is apparently struggling more with finances then he ever tells us, Carson got fired because he skipped work (for reasons he hasn’t admitted to us), and Chase has this school stuff now. I explained as carefully as I could to the parents that Chase is clearly depressed and needs help. [[JRE]]my didn’t seem to fully understand, but Kim did at least somewhat. They are looking into how getting him help will work with insurance and all that at the turn of the year.
MON 12:23 PM
(Book number 2 incoming)
MON 12:24 PM
On top of all that, our Tuesday game nights seem to be falling apart. On one side we have the “core” members who established these nights to begin with and actually care about everyone that comes, and on the other we have those that really only go for something to do OR to see specific people. That latter group is starting to become... angsty. They have keyboard fights in our Discord server (which is also a mess). Some of them clearly don’t give a shit about others and have NO problem degrading people with no thoughts about others’ feelings. The core member group is growing tired of it and starting to not attend as much, which is causing it to fizzle out. 

To speak to the “saying no” more portion, [[K]] and I realized we have something to do every night almost every week, and only a few of those things are actually enjoyable/filling. It’s getting too much for us. We’re always tired and our personal lives are suffering for it. We’re still looking out for one another, but we aren’t really giving ourselves time to do important things. For example, we still haven’t unpacked everything from when we moved five months ago. FIVE. Not to mention the fact that we let the registration on our car expire right under our noses and are having to deal with paying an unexpectedly hefty sum of taxes around that during an already expense-heavy time of year.
MON 12:32 PM
I am surprisingly okay after all this. [[K]] and I had a good talk yesterday about it all. Now I’m going to let you read that and respond. &gt;_&gt;
MON 12:34 PM
I wish I learned how to say &quot;no&quot; to myself and others as a teenager more effectively. I appreciate the difficulty of that topic; even today, I am bad at it.
MON 12:39 PM
I feel terrible for Chase.
MON 12:40 PM
I hate that he systematically does not have room to make large mistakes. The rules of the game of his life are against him (which is not to say he is absolutely blameless, obviously).
MON 12:42 PM
I hope medical care helps with his depression.
MON 12:42 PM
I am sorry to hear about the core group problem. It is the [[T42T]] vs [[T4T]] (or worse) problem, I think.
MON 12:44 PM
This is why I still believe that outgroups are morally and conceptually necessary to all finite computations of [[The Moral Law]]. You must have an opponent in the dialectic, and you must punish a failure to cooperate sometimes to prevent psychopathy (how forgiving you should be may be contextual). The different possible versions of who we can evolve into (as individuals or collectives) are game-theoretically narrowed (at least probabilistically) by our opponents when they play by particular rules.
MON 12:47 PM
How the core set of players who follow [[The Golden Rule]] interact with those who do not even play [[T4T]] is exceptionally important.
MON 12:48 PM
There is an unresolved problem or contradiction here leads to collapse of that tiny society.
MON 12:49 PM
Oh certainly
MON 12:50 PM
It’s incredibly frustrating and no one wants to or knows how to address it.
MON 12:50 PM
I commit to my theory (knowing I can be wrong) and put it to the test in offering the advice/claim of keeping the core group together.
MON 12:51 PM
We had a “let’s all agree to treat each other better because we actually give two shits about each other” talk, but it didn’t seem to do anything.
MON 12:51 PM
Yeah, the core group is already making plans to dissolve the standing one and move on to something else.
MON 12:51 PM
The older I get the more I realize you CAN and should choose your friends.
MON 12:52 PM
The Family By Choice
MON 12:52 PM
Exactly.
MON 12:52 PM
Speaking of, I love you and yours very much. I know I’m absolutely terrible about keeping in touch so it seems contradictory, but I do care for you all. I wish I could put you in a box and carry you around with me everywhere.
MON 12:53 PM
We are there. Our wikis are in a box! We do aim to cooperate radically with you too. =)
MON 12:54 PM
It’s hard to find good people in this world, and I’m glad I have you, [[k0sh3k]], and the kids to call my family.
MON 12:54 PM
I know, I just suck at keeping up. I’m working on rebuilding my habits, but it grows harder the older I get.
MON 12:54 PM
I'm very glad to have you in my life. I am very excited to see you.
MON 12:55 PM
I want to say thank you for being willing to make the trek out to us. It's a gift to us. =)
MON 12:56 PM
Gah, that’s about to make this next part harder. I actually wanted to talk to you about our holiday trip. 

[[K]] and I have thought long and hard about our time and money this holiday season. We have a lot of commitments that require a lot of travel because our friend/family circles are growing beyond Kentucky. Basically, we are traveling non-stop the moment Christmas Day happens.

So we have a proposition for you: Instead of spending three measly days (which truly translates to one full day and two partials because of travel), would it be possible to move our trip to the summer and see you all then? Our anniversary is in July, and I have a TON of vacation days saved up that we’d like to use then. This way we could really hash out when is best for us all and I won’t have to juggle stupid holiday work schedule rules to “work” instead of spending time with you guys. It would also allow us to actually be mentally present and not act like zombies due to exhaustion.
MON 1:05 PM
Of course!
MON 1:05 PM
And, I completely agree with your choice (even though I am sad that I will have to wait).
MON 1:06 PM
I’m sorry to go back and forth so much. I hate not getting to see you all for the holidays, but I want to actually spend time with you all.
MON 1:06 PM
It is not a problem. It is the pleasure of living our lives together across our [[4DID]].
MON 1:06 PM
Hehe
MON 1:07 PM
Thank you. It means a lot that you’d be willing to reschedule.
MON 1:07 PM
How soon is it to start planning? &gt;_&gt;
MON 1:08 PM
Life is roleplaying that matters the most to me; I think that's why I like thinking so much about roleplaying. Little microcosms that I can see play out give me a chance to model (inductively and [[fff]]ingly) something as large as life itself without being so blind. Even if roleplaying were just a toy, it would be a powerful tool.
MON 1:10 PM
As early as you'd like.
MON 1:10 PM
Summer is better for us. [[k0sh3k]] has halfdays on Fridays
MON 1:10 PM
It is also easier for her to get off of work, imho.
MON 1:11 PM
Same for me
MON 1:11 PM
/high-5
MON 1:11 PM
Woooo! o/
MON 1:11 PM
Wait I think I have a thing for high fives...
MON 1:11 PM
(=´∀｀)人(´∀｀=)
MON 1:12 PM
rofl
MON 1:12 PM
Found it. XD
MON 1:12 PM
taking it
MON 1:12 PM
I collect unicode art.
MON 1:12 PM
Any and all interesting snippets would be a gift.
MON 1:12 PM
Believe it or not, this one is from the Japanese keyboard on my iPhone
MON 1:13 PM
Neat.
MON 1:13 PM
ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ
MON 1:13 PM
As are these terrifying bear things.
MON 1:13 PM
I adore them.
MON 1:13 PM
XD
MON 1:13 PM
I think I have a whole doc of Unicode art.... I’ll have to see if I can find it.
MON 1:14 PM
I'm collecting all the rare pepes, but mine aren't images of frogs; they are just pieces of text art.
MON 1:15 PM
Perhaps I should actually grow a real section of my wiki for that.
MON 1:15 PM
Collecting is fun.
MON 1:15 PM
Hard to collect what matters most, gotta catch em all (whatever those special things are).
MON 1:16 PM
Agreed.
MON 1:21 PM
lol... and you should put them on your wiki if it’s important to you.
MON 1:21 PM
I’d be curious to see your “gallery”
