<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>So, yesterday, I realized we are bad parents. k0sh3k was sleeping on the couch (she was exhausted, the 'j3d1h' can drive anyone crazy). I was, of course, on the computer, with headphones so as not to disturb the living dead on the couch. The floors were clean and the bathrooms were as childproofed as we can make them. The door to the baser closed, electrical sockets plugged with the plastic thingies...you name it. The front door (the wooden one) was open, but the screen/plexiglass frontdoor was shut.</p><p>Somehow, without my active listening (headphones) and visual observation (the screen) directly on j3d1h, I found myself completely ignorant of her whereabouts and status. Anyways, the doorbell rings, and this old lady (a neighbor from across the street named &quot;Caroline&quot;...tells you how much I know about my neighbors after 10 years in E-town, a sad state of affairs in this world, but another matter altogether) was ringing the bell. k0sh3k and I got up, and Caroline was holding our child in her hands.</p><p>Apparently, j3d1h escaped the prison-house we have provided for her. I had no earthly idea she could get past that plexiglass door. All it takes is a tug on the handle (high up for her) and a push on the door (a decent push for her actually)‚Äìbut man, that is a lot for a little toddler like her. j3d1h, as usual, burst through the gates to freedom, running straight for the danger zone that makes my heart stop: the road. The sad part is that neither k0sh3k nor I even knew that j3d1h was out there.</p><p>We are very fortunate that j3d1h didn't get hurt and that a neighbor (who we don't even know) came to our rescue. It only takes one second of inattentiveness to ruin a lifetime. Uggh. We were kinda freaked out, especially about the part of not even knowing she had escaped.</p><p>Onto better news, I'm reading one of the best books I've ever read. It is called &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; by a this Stephen Pinker. It is a jam-packed thriller of psychology, philosophy, biology, grammar (I know, wtf, right?), and, oddly enough, computing. Plus, he puts in funny lines. I found this joke from to be very funny (k0sh3k thinks it is stupid, so it probably is‚ÄìI was just tickled by it):</p><p>A woman landed at Logan Airport (Boston) and asked the taxi driver, &quot;Can you take me someplace where I can get scrod?&quot; He replied, &quot;Gee, that's the first time I've heard it in the pluperfect subjunctive&quot;.</p><p>ROFL! (Scrod is a type of fish I believe, but the taxi driver ironically misunderstands the word to mean something very different)</p><p>Anyways, the book isn't about jokes. Although, there is a good deal of humor in it which is helpful when navigating the annals (better spell this one correctly!) of brain-mind-language-philosophy stuff. I think I'll let mom and dad have my book (they can't get good books in Thailand); I think they'd find it very interesting. This book is definitely &quot;archetype&quot; or &quot;era&quot; defining. A classic fo'sho'.</p><p>Also, in other important irrelevancies, I got a new cell phone because my other one died. Thank goodness, I need the battery life for my travels, and I use it constantly. I can't manage without one anymore.</p><p>We have been looking through schools, and we've decided that Talbot School of Theology is for us. We can't seem to find other schools that fit our desires, and Talbot has been spot on. k0sh3k is questioning what she will focus on. She is torn between Theology and Biblical studies (Old or New as well). I think she'll go for the Biblical exposition because she seems to enjoy that most. Although, she really is driven to apply the Bible in today's world, and Theology may be somewhat useful in that respect. I still think our understanding of theology (*a hybrid of biblical exposition and philosophy) is simply better than anything a school could ever give us. But, I won't discourage her from either of the studies simply because I don't know what they will be teaching her exactly. I just want her to be happy with whatever she chooses.</p><p>Allen said he might stay over the summer. Or, maybe he might live down the street and just chill at our house. Either way is cool with me.</p><p>Oh, and President Bush is retarded‚Äìand, I don't have to respect his office (quote me St. Paul and I'll give you a mouthful, as usual).</p></div>
