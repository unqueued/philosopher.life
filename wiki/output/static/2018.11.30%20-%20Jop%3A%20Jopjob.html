FRI 10:26 AM
I think you are the only one that I can talk with right now because everybody are working or people in Thailand are sleeping.
FRI 10:29 AM
And I also have many questions that I want to ask you.
FRI 10:30 AM
Actually not just you I want to talk to [[k0sh3k]] I want to talk to Miss Sherry and I want to talk to [[ALM]] also you include.
FRI 10:31 AM
I hopoe substituting went well for you.
FRI 10:38 AM
hope*
FRI 10:38 AM
Well, talk away, I'm here to listen.
FRI 10:39 AM
What questions do you have?
FRI 10:39 AM
I am happy to speak with you individually.
FRI 10:39 AM
I'm just not sure what should I pursue between continue working at the school but get Payless or try to find a CNA job that I know it's going to be very very hard but get pay more.
FRI 11:01 AM
I'll be working at a school and continuing to look for a different job.
FRI 11:02 AM
I would like to hear more from you please.
FRI 11:02 AM
Well, I write about it quite a bit on my wiki.
FRI 11:03 AM
What more do you want to know?
FRI 11:03 AM
I mean the reason behind that.
FRI 11:03 AM
Oh, well, the school pays slave wages. You can't afford to live on that pay.
FRI 11:03 AM
I think it's immoral to be payed so little.
FRI 11:03 AM
I enjoy  teaching and working in a school though, but I could use the money, lol.
FRI 11:04 AM
I'll take what job I can get and continue looking for a moral job that pays better.
FRI 11:05 AM
And what job do you think I should apply for? Because I can speak English but some job may think that I will not be able to communicate well enough that is one of my concern.
FRI 11:09 AM
That is a good question.
FRI 11:37 AM
You have some stiff competition too.
FRI 11:38 AM
Unemployment and underemployment are far worse than many people realize. There are a lot of people looking for jobs, and employers appear to have enough power they can pay as little as they wish. You are competing against people who have better credentials and background (according to the standards of an average employer).
FRI 11:40 AM
I don't know what direction you should go.
FRI 11:41 AM
What is stiff competition?
FRI 11:41 AM
https://www.englishbaby.com/vocab/word/9190/stiff-competition
FRI 11:42 AM
I like the name English baby yes that's for me.
FRI 11:43 AM
Just took the first result from google, hehe.
FRI 11:43 AM
Well right now I'm trying to be a good wife and a good mother.
FRI 11:48 AM
Yup. I hear that.
FRI 11:48 AM
This topic that I brought it up it's just make me think about Meer Christianity I read last night with [[ALM]] from chapter one.
FRI 11:50 AM
I don't know yet if I understand everything correctly because it's not an easy book but I would love to try to finish it without [[ALM]].
FRI 11:51 AM
It's a classic.
FRI 11:52 AM
Also about your Wiki I want to read it but everytime when I look it up I just don't know where to start it.
FRI 11:52 AM
You may just have to wander for a while.
FRI 11:52 AM
You can't read it all. You'll need to figure out what is worth reading to you.
FRI 11:52 AM
I think you should also make use of the search tools.
FRI 11:52 AM
I just wish your Wiki is like Kindle because when they were I don't know the vocabulary I just hit at the word and then the translation will pop up for me.
FRI 11:52 AM
That seems solvable.
FRI 11:53 AM
I believe you can set something like Google Chrome to use Thai as your primary language. That should enable you to translate. There are likely addons too.
FRI 11:53 AM

FRI 11:54 AM
Of course I will not be able to read them all.
FRI 11:54 AM
Sounds Good I know who can I ask to do it.
FRI 11:57 AM
[[ALM]] likely does not use Chrome.
FRI 11:57 AM
Chromium or Vivaldi would be able to use that addon
FRI 11:58 AM
:shocked_face_with_exploding_head:
FRI 11:58 AM
searching for them and reading will be useful
FRI 11:59 AM
Men sometimes have to understand too.
FRI 11:59 AM
Hard to
FRI 11:59 AM
It's a practice you should engage in relentlessly.
FRI 12:00 PM
You have to dive in to handle your language barrier.
