<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I love my son. He's my creation, and I live for him and his sister. He is amazing (and I'd love him just as much if he weren't). We are very compatible in many ways. I hope to help him become compatible with the world and himself. I hope to help him become a eudaimonic lifehacker, to be happy and possess (and use) the means to make himself happy. To the best of my abilities, I am preparing him to have a life he finds and will find worth living.</p><p>1uxb0x is a boy of many surprises. Sometimes it is very hard to gauge his aptitudes, strengths, and where he may falter. There aren't the clean rules of thumb I find for others. Half his lifetime ago, he didn't know to call me dad (he didn't really speak). He has come a very long way. His speech and communication are still impaired (very common with autism). We work on it everyday. </p><p>Reading has been a savior, expanding his vocabulary and helping him see the value in communications. His vocabulary can stun you sometimes, and then other times, he can't get out even the basic things he means to say. He has recently started writing (not just chatting with us) for real (a weak point of mine for a long time, and still in many ways). I hope to help my son find his voice with others. I hope to help him love learning, to see the necessity of hard work. I hope to prepare him for a world that isn't prepared for him. I hope we can build a friendship and family partnership for life.
