<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The goal of Darwall’s distinction between Appraisal Respect (AR) and Recognition Respect (RR) is to bring us closer to understanding the moral “respect to which all persons are entitled,”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> which I will refer to as Respect for Persons (RfP). Darwall believes RfP is some form of RR “owed to all persons,”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button>  and that RfP is categorically not a form of AR. According to Darwall, RfP occurs when we “take seriously and weigh appropriately” the property of personhood found in “persons in deliberating about what to do.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> That matches many of our intuitions. Indeed, Darwall makes a few fundamental distinctions which have to be right; however, he goes on to bend his conceptual analysis in ways we should not accept. My goal is to reveal the bare metal of these concepts and highlight concerns or questions surrounding them.</p><p>Darwall offers many definitions of RR.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">4</sup></button> To have RR is “to weigh appropriately in one's deliberations some feature of the thing in question to act accordingly.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">5</sup></button> RR is “giving appropriate consideration or recognition to some feature” of an object in deliberation “about what to do.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">6</sup></button> For example, I would take the fact that a dangerous bull is charging me as a salient fact for my deliberations for action, and assuming no other facts outweighed my prudential desires, I would flee for cover. I have RR for the fact that the bull is charging me when I weigh that fact and act.</p><p>Unfortunately, Darwall often refers to RR as an attitude or a disposition (technical terms in philosophy), but this is an unnecessary layer and perhaps an ad hoc limit to place on the concept of RR. Charitable interpretations of Darwall should lift this restriction, since it is obvious that the concept of RR can accommodate more diverse mental descriptions of this phenomenon.</p><p>Darwall emphasizes the psychological aspects of RR (intention and motivation are obviously key), but it is clear that he also aims for action to be an integral component of RR.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">7</sup></button> RR is an action resulting from or motivated by the appropriate deliberation concerning some target fact with some other facts.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">8</sup></button>  </p><p>A complete instance of RR consists in a pair: an action and a reason for that action which must be generated in a particular way. If we break apart an instance of RR, we find an object, a perceived feature/fact of that object, a weighing or deliberation of that perceived fact against other perceived facts, at least one subjective standard for weighing (which itself is a special kind of fact from the agent’s perspective), and the action which results from deliberation. Exactly what could count as a standard isn’t clear (the moral law, prudence, or many subjective standards seem to be viable candidates). Darwall emphasizes the feature of the object as the target of RR rather than the object itself.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">9</sup></button> Exactly how and which targets of RR are selected is not obvious.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">10</sup></button></p><p>It remains unclear to me whether targets of RR must ultimately modify or constrain the action of RR (a strong requirement), or if this fact need only be merely a factor with some (but not necessarily efficacious) weight in deliberations (a weak requirement). If a fact doesn’t have any real effect in weighing, if it isn’t the reason for acting, then can it be a viable target of RR? Darwall appears to imply this strong requirement. For example, he says, “to have recognition respect for something is to regard that fact as itself placing restrictions on what it is permissible for one to do.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">11</sup></button> Maybe, but it isn’t obviously true, and there might be exceptions.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">12</sup></button></p><p>Most significantly, Darwall tailored RR with voluntary deliberation and action. RR is the category of respect for which we can possibly be directly, morally responsible (that is not to say that all cases of RR are moral cases). This paves the way for RfP, as a kind of RR, to be morally required of us. Exactly how voluntariness plays out in RR, however, is quite unclear.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">13</sup></button> Darwall floods his paper with vague normative language. Darwall gives us a section on moral RR, and it seems as times that he is tempted to collapse the concept of RR into moral RR. Even if that isn’t the case, Darwall leaves behind odd breadcrumb statements about RR, such as, “any fact which is something that one ought to take into account in deliberation is an appropriate object.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">14</sup></button> I worry Darwall wishes to place an objective “ought” filter over what counts as a viable target for RR. Further, in trying to tailor RR as a voluntary kind of respect, Darwall often slips into his murky “appropriateness” language.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">15</sup></button> In charity, I take Darwall to be using a shotgun approach to defining RR, and only some of the expressions of RR should really stick in the final analysis. Despite my reservations, I think Darwall is quite right to emphasize the moral possibilities of RR. The voluntariness built into the concept of RR categorically separates it from AR. </p><p>Broadly, AR is a kind of attitude or judgment in which one holds an object in high regard without necessarily “having any particular conception of just what behavior from oneself would be required or made appropriate” by that object's “having the features meriting such respect.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">16</sup></button> AR doesn’t take features, facts, or characteristics of an object to be factors in deliberations concerning action; rather, an object is esteemed to some degree as a consequence of evaluating some set of its features against some standard of merit. For Darwall, the target of AR is the object rather than the features of the object.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">17</sup></button> AR is an esteem or awe for an object judged to be excellent or judged to have excellent features. This esteem is subjectively considered by the respecter to be merited or deserved.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">18</sup></button> For example, when I evaluate Nelson Mandela as a moral agent or person, I consider certain features/ facts about him in measuring his moral virtue, and the result is my esteem for him. Those facts don’t necessarily cause me to act in any particular way. I have AR for him when I simply judge him to be a person of moral merit, when I hold him in high regard or esteem because of how he measures against my subjective standard of what counts as being a good moral person.</p><p>AR seems to have a lot in common with the attitude or belief formation of doxastic involuntarism. This lack of voluntariness of AR distinguishes it from RR in a strong manner. It is not clear that AR is something for which one can be morally responsible. There is a possibility, however, that I am overstating the involuntariness of AR. For example, esteem might be understood differently, where I consider the hypothetical situation in which it was possible and morally permissible for me to choose between an object existing as P or Q, where all else being equal, P has more merit. I would choose for the object to exist as P. I worry that even appraisal has a kind of hypothetical action built into it. If this is correct, then perhaps the distinction between AR and RR is not as clear as I had hoped (I’m not sure).</p><p>While Darwall doesn’t phrase it this way, we can think of AR as an attitude or belief formed from evaluating to what degree a particular token satisfies what the agent subjectively takes to be the standard of the good of its type.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">19</sup></button> Esteem for a token object requires the respecter to have in mind some kind of standard which she uses to evaluate the token object. Presumably the respecter employs what she believes is the standard of the good of the type of the token. An instance of AR consists in a judgment formed by evaluating a token against the perceived standard of the good of its type.  Like RR, AR has an object and some set of features of the object, and a standard; unlike RR, AR uses its standard against which to measure the merit of an object’s features, rather than weighing features, and this results in a judgment (rather than an action).<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">20</sup></button> </p><p>Vexingly, Darwall posits an artificial limitation on the concept of AR: the “appropriate characteristics” to be evaluated in AR are “those which are, or are based on, features of a person which we attribute to his character.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">21</sup></button> He says AR is “a positive appraisal of a person or his character-related features.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">22</sup></button>  He claims the only viable targets of AR are persons, and the only viable features available for judgment are the moral characteristics of a person. He does not present a real argument for this limitation, although he does claim that AR “for a person assessed in a particular pursuit seems to depend on features of this character (or his excellence as a person) in at least two ways.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">23</sup></button>
 
First, Darwall considers a tennis player who “may be widely acclaimed as one of the best players in the world and not be widely respected by his fellows.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">24</sup></button> On his view, the tennis player’s moral character is a necessary component of being an excellent tennis player, and he won’t be judged as deserving AR if he is considered vicious. This fails to capture the everyday phenomenon of AR as we ordinarily experience it.</p><p>It seems to me that the tennis player is receiving AR as a tennis player given our standard of good of a tennis player, even if he doesn't receive AR as a person given our standard of good of a person. There are various ways in which we can have AR for a token object, and that is because an object can have many types, and we may employ a different standard of good for each type. We can view an object with different type-lenses, and we can employ different standards in evaluating an object. We can evaluate the object as a token of the type tennis player, or as a token of the type human, or as a token of the type person, or as a token of the type husband, etc. He might be a good a tennis player given the appropriate standard, he might even be a decent token human specimen, but then he might turn out to be an awful husband or terrible person.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">25</sup></button>
 
Darwell further claims that “purely 'natural' capacities and behavior manifesting them are not appropriate objects of appraisal respect...even in the context of a fairly narrowly defined human pursuit.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">26</sup></button> This is just another way of saying that the scope of AR is persons and their non-natural moral characteristics. I don’t see why we should agree. He also says, “there may well be characteristics of human beings which are regarded as human excellences but which are not appropriate grounds for appraisal respect.”<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">27</sup></button> He doesn’t offer a real argument for it. Even if he wanted to claim that we should focus on AR for persons (which is an interesting idea), to the exclusion of human excellence not involved in non-natural moral character, or any other type of excellence, it is obvious that AR is conceptually capable of targeting and evaluating other non-person types of objects, non-moral characteristics, and natural capacities.</p><p>A few examples can easily demonstrate why AR is more conceptually capable than Darwall claims. When I stand before Goliath, his natural gargantuan size (perhaps as a soldier in close-combat) fills me with awe. Goliath’s size is a natural capacity, but I can still be filled with AR for him when regarding him as a naturally gigantic soldier. When I see a particular tree flourishing according to the standard of the good of its kind, I evaluate it and appraise it as an excellent tree – a tree of merit. It deserves the title I give it because it meets the requirements set out by the standard of the good of trees. Even Darwall’s bank heist example is best understood by considering that the virtue of the practice of bank robbing and a vicious enough standard of morals (to be willing to steal and commit violent acts) are the standards one would use to reach AR for a particular bank robber. It is still a case of AR, even if it is an odd one. We have evaluated someone with a morally bad character as a good robber, according to the standard of what makes a good bank robber. Darwall’s definition and ad hoc limitations are a mistake.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">28</sup></button>
 
In his zeal to reveal how we can simultaneously fail to have RfP, a kind of RR, and succeed in having AR for the same person, Darwall has unnecessarily embedded moral notions into his definitions and bent his conceptual analysis. His goal is a good one, but he made a mistake in his analysis. We can arrive at this revelation without placing the ad hoc limits that Darwall adds, and indeed we shouldn’t agree to these limits. It is quite unclear why we should believe AR (or RR, if Darwall meant to go that far) is conceptually linked to morality, or moral character, or restricted only to persons as objects. </p><p>We are forced to generalize Darwall’s definitions of the concepts of respect which he has over-specified and artificially limits. What is necessary and sufficient? What should we eliminate? What matches our intuitions and our experiences of these phenomena? The bare metal notions are compelling. Darwall started out with kernels of truth, but then he took us down a rabbit hole.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">29</sup></button></p><p>I think Darwall’s overall project is generally right, and he gives us a useful framework for appreciating the various ordinary language uses of respect. The real goal, of course, is to better understand RfP. That is the sort of respect that matters the most. The claim that RfP is a kind of RR and not AR seems right. Honestly, I have no idea how to further define RfP, other than to claim it is simply being moral. I have no idea how to separate being moral from respecting persons in any significant way. I think it boils down to talking about two sides of the same coin. Define and explicate being moral, and I think you’ve defined and explicated RfP.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Darwall, Stephen.

Charity requires us to build some technical bridges to achieve an adequate understanding of his concepts. In the spirit of charity, I feel reluctantly forced to put words in Darwall’s mouth to make clearer what he likely means (or should mean). I will try to be charitable in my exegesis, and ultimately, I will walk away with definitions which may be different than Darwall intended, but I believe these concepts are much more useful, and don’t carry the same baggage.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">5 : </span> Ibid. </sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">6 : </span> Ibid. </sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">7 : </span> Ibid., 39</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">8 : </span> Darwall often ambiguously injects an objective notion of “appropriateness” into RR, and it blurs his analysis. What is this objective appropriateness? I will take “appropriate” to mean that the agent is rational in his weighing the facts against his subjective standard – that the agent makes the appropriate, rational inferences given the facts and subjective standard used in deliberation. I worry that Darwall is often tempted to inject an objective moral notion of appropriateness into RR, especially since he later adulterates his definition of AR with an artificial conceptual limitation based on morality. If he meant that, then it is a mistake, especially since several contradictions immediately arise in his examples. Take my paper as either giving him the benefit of the doubt of not making that mistake or attempting to salvage a viable analysis despite that mistake.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">9 : </span> The breakdown I’ve given is an atomic instance of RR, which is what I believe Darwall is arguing for. Of course, in many cases, an agent weighs multiple features of multiple objects, and essentially, we might conceive of these cases of deliberation and action as really a molecular set of atomic instances of RR. The crucial aspect of an atomic instance of RR is that it targets a single feature. The atomic components of a molecular instance of RR share the same action and deliberation, but they do not share the same targets: one feature, one atomic instance of RR.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">10 : </span> How do we select our targets for RR? Don't we need a reason for picking them out? Isn't targeting a fact for RR a kind of mental action which is the result of some subsequent instance of RR? I fear a regress.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">11 : </span> Ibid., 40</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">12 : </span> For example, it is possible that there are many features/facts of the moral law which are viable targets of RR, even when they are not deciding factors. It is possible these features can and should weigh in all my deliberations (hence, no deliberation should ever be an atomic instance of RR), even in those deliberations where these features ultimately have no impact on or in no way constrain what I can or should choose. The features of moral law, after all, do not always restrict my action (sometimes the moral law does not obligate or restrict any available choice in a circumstance), but I might want to say they can (and should) be viable targets of RR. </sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">13 : </span> What choices are possible in the various instances of RR? Can we choose our standard(s)? Can we choose whether or not to rationally weigh or how we apply the standard? Can we choose to disregard the results of that weighing? Can we choose whether or not to take a feature of an object as a factor in our weighing? Can we choose the weight of that feature and/or the other facts? </sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">14 : </span> Ibid. 40</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">15 : </span> Sometimes his language of “appropriateness” seems to imply an objective moral standard, but I don’t think we have to take him that way. In our conceptual analysis, it seems obvious that a vicious person, like his crook example, can have RR using a vicious standard. The standard the crook employs is not objectively, morally appropriate at all.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">16 : </span> Ibid., 39</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">17 : </span> No argument is given for this switch in target types. Careful examination may reveal that the real target of AR is still the feature of an object and not the object itself.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">18 : </span> I find the locution, 'when we speak of someone as meriting or deserving our respect, it is appraisal respect that we have in mind' on pg 39 somewhat odd. I think people merit or deserve our respect in the recognition sense as well. We can untangle this by realizing that appraisal 'desert' is judged via a standard of the good, while the recognition 'desert' is required by the standard of the right (the moral law).</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">19 : </span> Note that in some cases the agent could be using the wrong standard.

He says on pg. 45, 'Recognition respect for persons, then, is identical with recognition respect for the moral requirements that are placed on one by the existence of other persons.' We might take him to be talking about RfP, in which case he might be right. I want to point out that not all RR for persons is necessarily the same as RfP though. Why can’t RR for persons be based upon some standard of fear for the harm that other persons may cause us? RR for persons is broader than RfP. Hiding or killing other persons out of fear is a case of RR for persons. It just happens to be a case where the standard isn’t the moral law.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">29 : </span> Admittedly, RR seems to be far simpler than Darwall implies. The crux of the concept of RR is just a weighing of facts and an action resulting from that deliberation. If I take a fact to be salient for deliberation or weighing concerning my action, then that fact is the target of my RR. RR seems to be that simple and that broad, although the mechanics underlying it may be complex.</sub></p></div>
