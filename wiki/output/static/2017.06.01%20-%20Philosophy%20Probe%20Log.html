<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Quantum Consciousness</h2><p>Sources:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/</a> </li></ul><p>I don't pretend to understand the majority of this article. Further, I obviously bring a ton of assumptions to the table. I'm not going to hide that fact, and I'm not trying to draw up an argument for someone else here. I'm just trying to inspect and probe the issue for myself (my future self). I admit I have a fairly negative and skeptical view of most things. I apologize for my seeming lack of charity. I hope you can see I'm doing my best.</p><p>Quantum mechanics are some of the most tested scientific theories in recent human history. They are unintuitive but strongly supported. Unfortunately, we also do not understand how to unify quantum theory with macroscopic theories (relativity) in physics. I believe this lack of unity points towards a deep failure to understand the nature of physical reality. Thus, if we don't really understand quantum theory, I remain skeptical that we can understand, test, or satisfactorily model the human mind as it relates to quantum theory. I'm initially of the opinion that quantum theory relates to our neural system no more so than to our digestion. Perhaps in time, with a working unified theory based upon the assumption of a causally closed physical reality, my opinion will change.</p><p>My first introduction to this topic from reading Roger Penrose (of which I understood little or nothing, and perhaps nothing has changed).</p><p>Lastly, consciousness is poorly understood in itself. I think that humans have consciousnesses like mine. Other animals appear conscious, but I'm not in a good position to say whether or not they have a consciousness like mine. We have some language games and functional tests, but it is unclear. Problematically, I'm not even sure if I can nicely categorize what my consciousness was like (if I ever really had it) before I memories I could reflect upon (around age 5). It's murky, to say the least. </p><p>I think quantum consciousness is some magical buzzword at the moment. We will see if I'm wrong though.</p><p>The lack of determinism at this level poses significant questions and problematics. Libertarian Freewill Incompatibilists might initially think there is hope here. I see no hope for it though. I think of us as probabilistically determined creatures who program ourselves over time. Perhaps larger objects in our ontology rest upon a kind of quantum quicksand; I don't know. Regardless, we are deep into speculative philosophy here, and it isn't clear that quantum theory has anything directly to say on this matter.</p><p>Object-Oriented Ontology, with its postmodern destructuring, leads someone with strong skeptical and reductionist perspectives like me, to think the only reason it's worth talking about the emergence of consciousness is that we say it is, but nothing more. There is nothing objectively special to it, perhaps. We are swirling bits of information that we can arbitrarily perceive as emerging hierarchies of data structures and algorithms. My positive nihilism enjoys it anyway.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>What is the neural correlate of a mental representation? 
</p></blockquote><p>That is a good question. Part of me thinks that regardless of the answer, a blackbox mentality is accepted to some degree. It's unclear that answering the question provides any significant insight outside of the causal emergence properties.</p><p>I am open to the possibility that quantum mechanics are doing something valuable though. Consider the possibility that even plantlife uses it: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://phys.org/news/2014-01-quantum-mechanics-efficiency-photosynthesis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2014-01-quantum-mechanics-efficiency-photosynthesis.html</a>. Human brains do seem remarkably efficient in certain ways. They are marvelous. I would not be surprised if the evolutionary footholds necessary for the evolution of our minds rested upon abusing quantum physics. Maybe our brains have quantum computers embedded in this, I don't know.</p><p>I do not understand Penrose's claim that elementary conscious acts must be non-algorithmic. I'm not sure the world or we could be coherent if that were the case. Of course, I probably really, really don't understand what he is saying.</p><p>Ultimately, I do not understand how to make coherent, stable, deterministic-ish things out of random-ish parts. I think our minds really are complex computers. I hope that quantum computing and AI will reveal more about who we are. Obviously, I do not understand nearly enough. I feel like an observer of observers, trying to understand the world and formulate answers second-hand or worse. It sucks to realize I probably will never understand the beauty of what is being explained here.</p></div>
