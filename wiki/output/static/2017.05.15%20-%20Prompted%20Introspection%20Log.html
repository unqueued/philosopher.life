<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What is your most invaluable possession and why?</h2><ul><li>What counts as a possession? </li><li>Ah, do you think I'm making the mistake of responding to a question with a stream of questions? </li><li>What else do you expect from a philosopher?</li><li>Is there a difference between &quot;most invaluable&quot; and &quot;most valuable,&quot; and if so what is it and why?</li><li>Why is that question valuable?</li><li>Why is the above question valuable?</li><li>Why is the above question valuable?</li><li>Why is the above...go fuck yourself.</li></ul><p>I take a possession to be the target object of some person's or persons' Hohfeldian ownership claim right(s), a molecule of rights reducible to a complex set of atomic claim rights with corresponding duties assigned generally to other people. Problematically, possession comes in degrees and perhaps different kinds, especially under a variety of normative contexts (legal, moral, etc.). Possession, therefore, is a very complex normative concept, and it is likely more inclusive and complex than you imagined. </p><p>Do I possess my children? To the extent and kind that I do, they are clearly it. My wife's and my happiness are instrumentally invaluable qua being a means to my children as my telos. Or, perhaps Eudaimonia is still it. The Good Life in itself, inescapably, is that which I seek above all else. I'm a proper Egoist who understands how the happiness of others is necessary for my happiness. Is this a chicken or egg problem? I don't know. </p><p>Your question comes embedded with serious problems, and it's foundations are unclear. I don't even mean this in some Derridean post-structuralist sense about &quot;There is nothing outside the text&quot; or other equally skeptical problems (although, I take the point here too). There are too many unanswered questions for me to rightfully answer your question.</p><p>So, can I <em>possess</em> a telos? If so, in that respect, Eudaimonia seems the obvious answer. Maybe there is a difference between saying I &quot;have&quot; a telos and I &quot;possess&quot; a telos. I don't know. There is a sense in which it is perfectly natural to say it is my happiness, and yet there is another sense in which I find it strikingly odd to say I &quot;own&quot; my happiness. I think plenty of people don't have a right to the happiness they enjoy.</p><p>What has pure, unified, unconditional intrinsic value? Is it for me only? Is it universal? How universal? Is it particularized to the point absurdity? </p><p>Is this what I believe to be my most valuable possession, or are you asking something more objective? Can it change, and how so?</p><p>The question requires a metamodern framework to overcome so many timeless questions, clearly.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">1</sup></button> I don't quite have one, other than to attempt to give you a practical answer.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">2</sup></button></p><p>Okay, um, so I take my life to be my most invaluable possession.</p><p>Oh, you don't like that answer, do you? Maybe you find my answer to be #iamverysmart annoying to you.<button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-slider"><sup style="color:#66ff66">3</sup></button> Maybe you think it's cheating? It's sneaky and cheatyfaced, eh? It's kind of like answering &quot;Jesus&quot; in church; you'll get the answer ultimately right at least 50% of the time, but you've somehow evaded the intention of the question's author by piercing too much to the heart of the matter. You were looking for a more concrete, simple, almost relativistically dismissable answer, I suppose. You think that answering the question with some physical object tells the answerer something important about themselves. Well, then my answer seems fine. It says what I mean and tells me about who I really am, right?</p><p>Thus ends my first masturbation session in my newly founded <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="Prompted%2520Introspection%2520Log.html">Prompted Introspection Log</a>.</p><hr><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">1 : </span> Go ahead and kill yourself, psychopath.</sub></p><p><span class=" tc-reveal" hidden="true"></span></p><p><sub><span style="color:green">2 : </span> Thank you Plato, Aristotle, and Kant.
