<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>I like how the &quot;m&quot; word points to a disability that is actually so obviously an ability. We are tribal, otherising, scared of things we don't understand, fearful of that which can overpower us, etc.</p><p>The initial aspects of the book are truly lonely, miserable, and sets us up to want the absolute best for HP. We want magic to touch his life.</p><p>We also see him wield it vindictively (or worse) towards Dud.</p><p>Dobby might not be a fun character, but I'm very glad he's there. Dumb as it sounds, he might be one of the fundamental examples of a slave in the minds of a non-trivial percentage of the 1st world populace. Not enough people reason about the issue.</p><p>Of course, the underage magic bullshit annoyed me. I still feel it, lol.</p><p>The escape is wonderful. Who doesn't need that from time to time in their lives?</p><p>I absolutely adore how fucking punk this can be. Questioning authority is built in. I can't say I love everything Rowling does, but I'm grateful she gave this memeplex to kids everywhere.</p><p>This was a book that made it clear to me what family really means. I hope not to fail my own children in this regard.</p><p>Gnomes are whimsy. She weaves serious content with whimsy. It's got a nice pacing.</p><p>I am still moved by the gratitude expressed in these books. The love is still real. God damnit, I'm already fucking tearing up. </p><p>Of course, the buying of school supplies is a special time for those of us that loved school. You know, my children don't get to experience that. I wish I could put myself into their shoes more effectively on this front.</p><p>Capitalism is calling, hello. Racism and reactionary bullshit abounds too.</p><p>Also, the &quot;Dark Lord&quot; reminds me of the kinds of coding allowed in different social contexts. I think this could have been taken much further. The weak Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis and a number of power dynamics should be given examples. </p><p>I love how much she shits on media and motivations of those who distribute information.</p><p>Classism here is wonderfully presented; I really do hate so many fucking characters. My blood is boiling, and I'm reading a fucking children's book (maybe I'm still a child, lol). The emotional neural pathways of this book are still deep in me. </p></div>
