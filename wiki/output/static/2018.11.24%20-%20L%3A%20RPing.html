SAT 11:34 AM
What you up to this weekend? =)
SAT 11:34 AM
Hey!
SAT 12:38 PM
Hey =)
SAT 12:38 PM
Thanksgiving went well ‚Äî mom and I were cooking/working/cleaning almost all day, but it was still more mentally relaxing than work.
SAT 12:39 PM
Honestly I‚Äôve needed the break.
SAT 12:39 PM
As for what we‚Äôre up to ‚Äî basically nothing. HURRAH!
SAT 12:39 PM
I heard you guys had a good Thanksgiving
SAT 12:39 PM
Awesome and awesome =)
SAT 12:39 PM
Yeah, it was good. Got to see lots of folks and good food.
SAT 12:40 PM
Well, I hope your nothingness is extra relaxing.
SAT 12:42 PM
We're working on computer stuff today. Grinding away on the wiki as usual. Hope to hit goodwill to pickup some sweaters. Gonna be mostly a chill day.
SAT 12:48 PM
Nice
SAT 12:50 PM
Goodwill sweaters are always the best for some reason
SAT 12:51 PM
They do the job. I don't want to scare people away with bare bear chesthair.
SAT 12:51 PM
It's a sweater on a sweater, like a hat on a hat.
SAT 12:51 PM
lol...
SAT 12:53 PM
Sounds staticky
SAT 12:53 PM
I need all the sweaters. I end up wearing four layers in the deep winter. I have no heat retention.
SAT 12:53 PM
Indeed. You like thermals?
SAT 12:54 PM
I do!
SAT 12:54 PM
I have thermal shirts and pants
SAT 12:54 PM
My toes, fingers, ears, and nose get cold. I have very poor cirk-uh-lay-shun.
SAT 12:55 PM
Mine do too. You should see me when I have to walk to my office building.
SAT 12:57 PM
The Bundle
SAT 12:57 PM
Pretty sure I‚Äôm appropriating eskimo culture
SAT 12:57 PM
lol
SAT 12:57 PM
We‚Äôre talking scarves over hats under hoods
SAT 12:58 PM
Do you like the taste of seal blubber?
SAT 12:58 PM
Ear muffs
SAT 12:58 PM
They do make good ear muffs.
SAT 12:58 PM
...never tried it.
SAT 12:58 PM
XD
SAT 12:58 PM
I should pull a sky walker and just wear a  beast carcass
SAT 12:58 PM
Lol. That's exactly what I was googling for.
SAT 12:59 PM
Heheheh
SAT 1:00 PM
Well, it's better if it's half alive still, heart pumping the blood. You want that use that circulatory system to your advantage.
SAT 1:00 PM
They might prefer you work from home that day.
SAT 1:00 PM
Idk man
SAT 1:03 PM
I could think of some coworkers that would appreciate it.
SAT 1:03 PM
They have a seal carcass suit fetish.
SAT 1:04 PM
Or, they are very hungry.
SAT 1:04 PM
Hey, don‚Äôt kink shame them
SAT 1:05 PM
On the plus side, had some good discussions with my mom and sister.
SAT 1:13 PM
Good. I am glad. It sounds like it's been productive family time.
SAT 1:15 PM
I think [[AG]] is realizing how much it takes to be a functioning adult. She started saying last night that she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ready for college.
SAT 1:16 PM
Mom and I told her it was either that or a trade school, but she doesn‚Äôt really get a choice.
SAT 1:16 PM
I mean, technically we can‚Äôt tell her otherwise. But ya know
SAT 1:16 PM
I gotcha.
SAT 1:17 PM
I‚Äôve given her a mission of learning how to wake up on her own.
SAT 1:17 PM
Goals are good.
SAT 1:18 PM
Adulting is a whirlwind.
SAT 1:19 PM
Meaning with an alarm clock or whatever
SAT 1:19 PM
aye
SAT 1:19 PM
Apparently mom still wakes her up in the morning because she sleeps through alarms. But mom‚Äôs not going to be there to wake her up every day.
SAT 1:19 PM
She‚Äôll have to figure it out.
SAT 1:20 PM
Well, she has several years to prepare for college. That is good.
SAT 1:21 PM
Exactly. I figured we might as well start now!
SAT 1:21 PM
That way she can work towards independence at her own pace rather than all at once in a likely traumatic fashion...
SAT 1:21 PM
I really wasn't prepared myself (though, I generally don't feel prepared...except for cheesecake. Always prepared for that.).
SAT 1:21 PM
True dat.
SAT 1:21 PM
lolol
SAT 1:22 PM
If you‚Äôre not prepared for cheesecake, there‚Äôs something wrong.
SAT 1:22 PM
I‚Äôm also deciding what she needs to learn about before college street-wise
SAT 1:22 PM
A list.
SAT 1:23 PM
I had to explain to that child what ovulation was in respect to her period.
SAT 1:23 PM
Ah.
SAT 1:23 PM
In case this is useful: https://philosopher.life/#Phrasing%2C%20Boom%3A%20That's%20What%20She%20Said.:%5B%5BPhrasing%2C%20Boom%3A%20That's%20What%20She%20Said.%5D%5D
SAT 1:23 PM
Image attached to message
SAT 1:23 PM
lol!
SAT 1:23 PM
Actually, this is very useful.
SAT 1:28 PM
I may browse some of those YouTube videos to see if I can‚Äôt find something helpful
SAT 1:28 PM
Well, I'm glad it's useful. =)
SAT 1:32 PM
Now the question is, how straightforward am I about it?
SAT 1:32 PM
I cannot answer that question for you.
SAT 1:32 PM
Apparently time away from my parents had made my speech ‚Äúcrude‚Äù (according to my dad)
SAT 1:33 PM
A fascinating claim.
SAT 1:33 PM
The crazy part is I didn‚Äôt even cuss that much in front of them. Let two slip the whole weekend.
SAT 1:34 PM
I know that‚Äôs not the only thing that constitutes crude speech, but it seems to be the thing that bothers them the most.
SAT 1:35 PM
Image attached to message
SAT 1:35 PM
There is a difference between social conventions and The Moral Law. They have an important relationship.
SAT 1:36 PM
Is there a moral problem with your crudeness?
SAT 1:36 PM
Perhaps? I‚Äôm not as conservative as I used to be, but we didn‚Äôt really get into it while we were there.
SAT 1:37 PM
It is an issue I've had to think about for a long time as well.
SAT 1:37 PM
I am vigilant in how I reason about how others shape what words I'm &quot;allowed&quot; to use. Not all reasons are good ones.
SAT 1:38 PM
Right.
SAT 1:38 PM
I believe their logic is it‚Äôs socially considered crude and ‚Äúthose words‚Äù are usually used to tear others down.
SAT 1:39 PM
Are those good reasons? Did they apply to your context?
SAT 1:40 PM
I work with and have friends/family who do not find them crude. And I don‚Äôt often use them to tear others down either. More as descriptors for things. Like ‚Äúthis piece of shit‚Äù or ‚Äúthat fuckin thing‚Äù
SAT 1:41 PM
Especially when I‚Äôm angry.
SAT 1:41 PM
I think marking certain words as ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù is what gives them their power.
SAT 1:42 PM
Makes sense. Swearing has lots of valuable attributes, including: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalgesic_effect_of_swearing
SAT 1:43 PM
Hehe, yeah. I‚Äôve heard of this before.
SAT 1:44 PM
You guys doing DnD tomorrow?
SAT 1:46 PM
[[K]] was saying he might be out of the game for now (one of them).
SAT 1:46 PM
Part of it all is that when I first went to college, I realized there were a lot of things my parents did/said/believed that I didn‚Äôt necessarily agree with now that I actually had the choice.
SAT 1:47 PM
I hear that.
SAT 1:48 PM
I didn‚Äôt realize how stifling? forceful? their methods can be when it comes to personal beliefs. Yeesh.
SAT 1:48 PM
Anyways, to address your question ‚Äî no, we aren‚Äôt playing because of the Thanksgiving holiday
SAT 1:48 PM
And that particular game he‚Äôs out of we are all out of for now. The DM doesn‚Äôt want to continue if one of us is leaving, which I appreciate.
SAT 1:49 PM
I asked the DM if we could continue if we were to replace the problem players and he said maybe, so we‚Äôll see.
SAT 1:49 PM
Ah, makes sense.
SAT 1:50 PM
Honestly... the guy who pushed [[K]] to his limits is proving to be a problem in all our other games as well.
SAT 1:50 PM
He doesn‚Äôt like other people‚Äôs play styles and gets pissed when they‚Äôre just trying to play their way but it causes problems for him.
SAT 1:51 PM
In the sense of ‚ÄúI am roleplaying as my character who would totally do this, even if it‚Äôs dumb out of character or I as a player know better‚Äù
SAT 1:52 PM
I can appreciate that. It's reverse 4th wall-breaking, metagaming, and eisegesis.
SAT 1:53 PM
I'm not sure I hold the same requirements, but I can see a side where the internal story's consistency and coherence just IS the constructive point.
SAT 1:54 PM
He doesn‚Äôt like that though. He wants to play D&amp;D as a video game where he gets to control all of us, and will push other players out (like [[K]]) if they do something he doesn‚Äôt like.
SAT 1:54 PM
He word for word said ‚Äúevery time your character talked I checked out mentally ‚Äî this session was so boring‚Äù
SAT 1:54 PM
(To [[K]])
SAT 1:55 PM
jesus
SAT 1:55 PM
lol
SAT 1:55 PM
That is fucked up.
SAT 1:55 PM
Yeah. [[K]] was upset.
SAT 1:55 PM
I was mad that he would say that to a person and then not understand why that hurt his feelings. It‚Äôs a team game dude. Get over yourself.
SAT 1:55 PM
What is winning in DnD?
SAT 1:56 PM
It depends on the group, honestly.
SAT 1:57 PM
For this group, as stated by the DM, it was staying in character as much as possible and overcoming challenges as a group.
SAT 1:57 PM
(also, so I don't forget to eject it from my clipboard: I think about what you said a lot in my own upbringing and raising my own children. I believe conservative-driven fascism continues to rise with the Crisis of Capitalism.)
SAT 1:58 PM
So DnD is a game in which the DM selects the win conditions?
SAT 1:58 PM
or does the DM simply give you the mechanics and rules up to a certain point?
SAT 1:59 PM
Is it a collectively defined set of win conditions?
SAT 1:59 PM
I can appreciate it being contextual, particularized to the players in combination.
SAT 1:59 PM
I would say the last two ‚Äî the DM gives mechanics and rules up to a certain point. This DM made it pretty clear that he was going to rely heavily on roleplay and wanted us to stick together as a party even if it was rough at first.
SAT 2:00 PM
And this guy seemed to agree to that along with the rest of us... but apparently his definition of getting along as a party is different than ours.
SAT 2:01 PM
Ah. He broke a kind of social contract.
SAT 2:04 PM
Yeah. And also hurt someone‚Äôs feelings pretty drastically. Like, damn.
SAT 2:04 PM
Yes. Seems like multiple problems.
SAT 2:05 PM
[[K]] doesn‚Äôt usually let people get to him. But he was NOT happy after that conversation.
SAT 2:05 PM
I wouldn't be either.
SAT 2:05 PM
[[JRE]] was telling me about a player that said to him &quot;You are the worst kind of player.&quot; I'm not sure what to do with that kind of toxicity.
SAT 2:06 PM
...leave the group and never play with that person again?
SAT 2:06 PM
That‚Äôs what I would do.
SAT 2:06 PM
I think that's what [[JRE]] ended up doing in this case.
SAT 2:07 PM
DnD players are often fringe.
SAT 2:08 PM
I don't enjoy people-watching on the street, but I think people-watching a DnD game is a non-trivial experience.
SAT 2:08 PM
Agreed
SAT 2:10 PM
As always, I will recommend West World to you. =)
SAT 2:10 PM
There‚Äôs actually a pretty popular series on YouTube called Critical Roll where a bunch of voice actors get together to okay
SAT 2:10 PM
To play**
SAT 2:10 PM
That adds another layer of simulation to it.
SAT 2:11 PM
Matthew Mercer (voice of McCree from Overwatch) is the DM. He does cool voices for his NPCs/monsters
SAT 2:12 PM
I am a cynical man. I suggest the possibility that portions of it are heavily choreographed (beyond the standard planning of DMs and players), though I have not seen it.
SAT 2:12 PM
But actually, watching other people play/DM like that is super helpful for me too. Grants me experience ‚Äúby proxy‚Äù for some things.
SAT 2:12 PM
Quite possibly
SAT 2:12 PM
It‚Äôs still fun to watch
SAT 2:12 PM
A story of a story of a story.
SAT 2:13 PM
Hehe
SAT 2:13 PM
Oh, fun update (not really...)
SAT 2:14 PM
Got an email today that there was a fire in our apartment building... two days ago.
SAT 2:14 PM
WOw.
SAT 2:15 PM
[[K]] called to ask what happened and see if our apartment had been hit, but we‚Äôre heading home to check it out now.
SAT 2:15 PM
Uh, is your apartment okay?
SAT 2:15 PM
ah
SAT 2:15 PM
They said it ‚Äúshould be‚Äù
SAT 2:15 PM
So reassuring. -_-
SAT 2:15 PM
/facepalm
SAT 2:15 PM
I think a fire would wipe us out.
SAT 2:15 PM
I figured if our apartment had be hit they would have called us...
SAT 2:15 PM
If we have been hit we have renter‚Äôs insurance...
SAT 2:16 PM
Not sure what we‚Äôll do in the mean time though.
SAT 2:16 PM
But that‚Äôs if we are hit
SAT 2:17 PM
Not sure uet
SAT 2:17 PM
Er, yet*
SAT 2:17 PM
/fingers-crossed
SAT 2:17 PM
Alright, I gotta go for meow
SAT 2:19 PM
My phone is super dying and I don‚Äôt have a cord lol
SAT 2:19 PM
ttyl, love you =)
SAT 2:19 PM
Love you too ‚Äî I‚Äôll update you on the fire bits when I can
SAT 2:19 PM
Looks like everything‚Äôs okay
SAT 2:35 PM
Yay! =)
SAT 2:35 PM
The fire was on the far side of the apartment building we‚Äôre in
SAT 2:35 PM
Good.
