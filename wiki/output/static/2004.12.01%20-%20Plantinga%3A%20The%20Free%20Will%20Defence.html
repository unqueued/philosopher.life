<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><em>‚ÄúWhich brings me to my conclusion upon Free Will and Predestination, namely let the reader mark it that they are identical.‚Äù  	-Winston Churchill</em></p><p><em>‚ÄúWe have to believe in free will. We‚Äôve got no choice.‚Äù 	-Isaac B. Singer</em></p><p>Alvin Plantinga is widely acclaimed in the philosophy of religion community for his defense of theism, or more exactly, the logical possibility of theism. He uses contemporary modal logic to defend and formulate rigorous epistemological and ontological arguments (Honderich 683). Plantinga ultimately argues that belief in God can be a rational, logically consistent, and a warranted belief, even in the face of the evidential argument from evil.</p><p><strong>Problem of Evil</strong></p><p>The Problem of Evil previously jeopardized the logical consistency of theism. The precise argument for the Problem of Evil is often credited to J.L. Mackie. The theist‚Äôs difficulty arises from the following propositions:</p><ol><li>God is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good (and extant).</li><li>Evil exists</li></ol><p>Mackie states that theists are logically inconsistent, forming a contradiction, when they claim that propositions (1) and (2) are simultaneously true (Mackie 263). Mackie relies upon the idea that a perfectly good, omnipotent, and omniscient being (God) would do all in His power to terminate (or never allow) the existence of evil.</p><p>Plantinga believes that theists are not explicitly contradicting themselves when they hold propositions (1) and (2) to be simultaneously true. He goes on to explain a series of arguments which appears to allow for the possibility (however small or great) for (1) and (2) to be concurrently true.</p><p><strong>The Free Will Defence</strong></p><p>The ‚ÄúFree Will Defence‚Äù is one of more effective theories used to further the logical consistency of theism. Alvin Plantinga is very famous for his expansion on this argument. He explains that, ‚ÄúIf a person S is free with respect to a given action, then he is free to perform that action and free to refrain; no causal laws and antecedent conditions determine either that he will perform the action, or that he will not‚Äù (Plantinga 93). This particular definition of free will is not the traditional explanation, but Plantinga must be very concise about what he means by free will to examine the workings of a delicate argument, i.e. this is just the tip of the iceberg. His above definition only requires that nothing (not even God himself) can prevent a choice or determine the choice of a truly free person.</p><p>With a base understanding of what a ‚Äòfree person‚Äô can and cannot in fact do Plantinga moves on to the core of the Free Will Defence. He explains, ‚ÄúA world containing creatures who are sometimes significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being, equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all‚Äù (Plantinga 93). He is very careful not explain a world in which God‚Äôs creatures are always free; primarily because one could easily argue that persons are not always free, that at times persons are simply driven or caused to behave in a particular way. Take for instance a mental disease or incapacitating drug, victims are truly not free with respect to any action because they are forced by an outside factor to act as they do in these circumstances. But, Plantinga doesn‚Äôt need permanently free persons. The Free Will Defence only requires that persons are at least sometimes free so that it might be possible for God to not be responsible for evil, and so that (hopefully) it will be apparent that theism and the existence of evil can be logically compatible. One must remember: Plantinga is only looking for the mere possibility of theism being logically consistent. And in the end, this is all the theist really needs (at this point in philosophy at least) to maintain the appearance of a rational belief.</p><p>Orthodox Judeo-Christian believers may not realize what the Free Will Defence requires. It requires, in some senses, a minimization of the transcendent God‚Äôs powers, or at least a more concise definition of what is and is not possible for God in this instance. Often, people are unwilling to place limits on God‚Äôs abilities, but in this rigorous argument, God has certain logical limits; Plantinga is straightforward about this issue. He explains that, ‚ÄúGod can create free creatures, but he cannot cause or determine them to do only what is right. For if he does so, then they are not significantly free after all; they do not do what is right freely‚Äù (Plantinga 93). The Free Will Defender must accept that there are certain things that an omnipotent God simply cannot do, including determining (in any way) the actions of a truly free person. God can‚Äôt create a married bachelor, a squared circle, or make 2+2 equal 5, these are all propositions that Plantinga feels God has no control over. It should be noted that Plantinga is defending a freedom that is very extensive, far beyond what most consider just a normal ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù He defends a free will that in itself is a creative power, a power given by God, a power that God no longer has in all instances, a power in which that free person truly acts freely.</p><p>The problem of evil, and even the discussion of God, relies upon the assumption that there is moral good and moral evil. Plantinga examines the free person‚Äôs ability to create moral good and moral evil. He says, ‚ÄúTo create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, he must create creatures capable of moral evil; and he cannot leave these creatures free to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so‚Äù (Plantinga 93). Plantinga is further stressing the capabilities of those who have free will, and consequently refers to God‚Äôs lack of capability in that instance. Can God stop a person from performing a moral evil? Yes. But in the moment God would do such, the person (who is experiencing this divine intervention) will not be in fact free, for God prevented an action that a truly free person would have been capable of choosing.</p><p>The Free Will Defender believes that, ‚ÄúGod did in fact create significantly free creatures; but some of them went wrong in the exercise of their freedom: this is the source of moral evil‚Äù (Plantinga 93). If free creatures, those who make certain choices outside the power of God, are the source of all moral evil, then God is not responsible for moral evil, because he didn‚Äôt create it. By eliminating the possibility for free creatures to create moral evil, God would have eliminated the possibility for free creatures to create moral good. An important aspect of his argument for us recognize is that only free persons (God as such is traditionally considered person as well) are capable of creating moral good and/or moral evil. Essentially, this leads Plantinga to explain that ‚Äúit is possible that God could not have created a universe containing moral good (or as much moral good as this one contains) without creating one containing moral evil‚Äù (Plantinga 94).</p><p><strong>The Objection</strong></p><p>The previous argument only outlined ways in which an omnipotent and perfectly good being could possibly not be responsible for the existence of evil. But, as we will find, the most difficult argument for the theist to overcome is the problem of evil from God‚Äôs foreknowledge of evil. Plantinga beings to reveal this difficult problem when he says, ‚ÄúIt is logically a possibility that there be a world containing significantly free creatures who always do what is right‚Äù (Plantinga 94). He does not really mean the Free Will Defender holds the above claim to be true. Instead, he says that the Free Will Defender is forced to reckon with the possibility of God knowing what free persons would do within a given possible world, and then choosing to create a world in which free persons would choose (of their own creative freedom) to only do what is right. Even worse, Plantinga shows that the Defender must answer to just the possibility of a world with only moral good and no moral evil. The Objector states:</p><p>(3) God could have created just any possible world he chose, including those containing moral good but no moral evil.</p><p>Keeping (3) in mind, the Objector goes on to say, ‚ÄúBeing perfectly good, [God] must have chosen to create the best world [He] could; being omnipotent, [He] was able to create just any possible world [He] pleased. He must, therefore, have chosen the best of all possible worlds; and hence this world, the one [He] did create, must be (despite appearances) the best possible‚Äù (Plantinga 95). Leibniz put forth the idea that God, if he exists, must create the best of all possible worlds. The Objector will also side with Leibniz because it seems very rational. If God must choose to create the best of all possible worlds, and God can create a world with moral good and no moral evil (a world better than the actual, present world), and the actual, present world has both moral good and evil, then God did not create this world. The objector could easily to follow up his previous claim with: ‚ÄúGod the creator does not exist.‚Äù What does the Free Will Defender say to an apparently valid argument like the objectors? Plantinga answers, ‚ÄúThe Free Will Defender wonders whether there is a best of all possible worlds. Central to the Free Will Defence is the claim that God, though omnipotent, could not have created just any possible world he pleased‚Äù (Plantinga 95). The Defender rejects (3), consequently, a very rigorous argument ensues to show why (3) cannot be true.</p><p><strong>Possible Worlds</strong></p><p>Plantinga speaks in the language of ‚Äúpossible worlds.‚Äù We are faced with the question: ‚ÄúWhat possible worlds could God have created?‚Äù Obviously God created the heavens and the earth, and the universe, etc.‚Äîbut, he couldn‚Äôt have created himself, or ‚Äúnumbers, propositions, properties, or states of affairs: these have no beginnings. We can say, however, that God actualizes states of affairs‚Äù (Plantinga 95). What the hell does Plantinga mean?</p><p>Painstaking arguments, such as the one Plantinga put forth, often assume that readers have a certain set of knowledge. To some philosophers, it is quite clear that God can only do what is possible for God to do, and so forth and so on. Logical constraints are already set upon God in this discussion. If God wasn‚Äôt subject to the laws of logic, then there wouldn‚Äôt be much point in questioning the logical consistency of the concurrent existence of both God and evil. Plantinga takes the logical constraints to be true, and so he must deal with the Objector‚Äôs argument, and utilizing a very rigorous logic to defeat the objection may be his only option. Plantinga introduces modal logic at this point in his writing. We ask ourselves: ‚ÄúWhat is a possible world?‚Äù A possible world is a world that differs in some way from our ‚Äúactual‚Äù world; it is what many consider to be a hypothetical world. To dig deeper into the meaning of a possible world, one must understand the concept of contingent and necessary truth. A contingent truth is a truth that could possibly have been different. For example:</p><p>(4)	The North won the civil war.
(4‚Äô) 	The North did not win the civil war.</p><p>Even though (4) is actually true, can we not at least ponder the possibility that (4‚Äô) could in some hypothetical sense be true? Imagine a world that is almost exactly the same as our actual world during the point at which the South or the North would decidedly win or lose the war; and in this world only one difference occurred, the North did not win the civil war. A contingent truth is just like (4) or (4‚Äô), either could have possibly been true. Plantinga is primarily concerned with these truths, especially since they provide the most difficult problems for the theist.</p><p>A necessary truth is ‚Äútrue in all possible worlds‚Äù (Fischer 49). An example would be 2+2=4. Most people are willing to take for granted that whether the North won or did not win the civil, 2+2 would always equal 4. There isn‚Äôt a possible world in which 2+2=4 could be false. Often, necessary truths are self-explanatory. For example: ‚Äúa bachelor is not married,‚Äù and ‚ÄúA is A,‚Äù represent self-explanatory truths that must be true in all possible worlds, thus they are necessary truths as well.</p><p>A possible world is simply a combination of propositions, these propositions range from necessary truths to contingent truths. A possible world will always have an internally, logically consistent set of truths. </p><p>Plantinga explains, ‚ÄúProperties are not creatable: to suppose that they have been created is to suppose that although they exist now, there was a time at which they did not; and this seems clearly false‚Äù (Plantinga 96). Properties are just ideas; all logically consistent ideas exist in all possible worlds. The color blue for instance is just a configuration of light waves, blue is a property, the configuration of light waves that makeup blue are true in all possible worlds, regardless of whether those light waves actually exist. Plantinga goes on to say that, ‚ÄúNecessary states of affairs do not owe their actuality to the creative activity of God‚Äù (Plantinga 96). Clearly the very possibility of properties is not created by God, number theory and rules of logic cannot be created by God. These exist with God. This may be a very hard thing to swallow for some theists, but Plantinga must have this understanding to further his argument, otherwise it appears that the evidential argument from evil is true. However, God obviously must actualize some states of affairs; those are the contingent states of affairs. Plantinga elaborates, ‚ÄúWe may say that God can actualize a given possible world W only if he can actualize every contingent state of affairs W includes‚Äù (Plantinga 96). Basically, God can only do what is possible for God to do.</p><p><strong>Freedom</strong></p><p>Plantinga‚Äôs argument becomes very difficult at this point in the text. He clarifies his explanation of free will when he says, ‚Äúa person is free with respect to an action A at a time t only if no casual laws and antecedent conditions determine either that he performs A at t or that he refrains from doing so‚Äù (Plantinga 97). He is taking into consideration the concepts of contingency and necessity, both of which derive their meaning in his argument from whether or not they act as antecedent conditions. </p><p>Free persons are not free to do anything; they cannot jump over Draper, or fly, or drink twenty gallons of vodka in an hour. What does it mean to be free? To be free is to have the ability to do otherwise (van Inwagen 20). But is this enough of a definition for Plantinga? He explains that, ‚ÄúIf I am free with respect to an action A, then God does not bring it about or cause it to be the case either that I take or that I refrain from this action; he neither causes this to be so through the laws he establishes, nor by direct intervention, nor in any other way. For if he brings it about or causes it to be the case that I take A, then I am not free to refrain from A, in which case I am not free with respect to A‚Äù (Plantinga 97). </p><p><strong>Contingency and God‚Äôs Inability to Create Some Possible Worlds</strong></p><p>Plantinga explains that there are ‚Äúcontingent states of affairs such that it is not within the power of God to bring about their actuality‚Äù (Plantinga 98). God cannot cause the world to be such that I freely refrain from washing my dishes, for that wouldn‚Äôt be free at all. It is true that God can create a world in which I freely refrain from washing my dishes, but he cannot cause me to do so. He then explains that, ‚ÄúGod could have actualized a given possible world W if and only if for every contingent state of affairs S that W includes, there is a time at which God can actualize S‚Äù (Plantinga 98). A world can‚Äôt be created unless God can actualize everything in it. Plantinga unravels his argument as he says, ‚ÄúGiven just the possibility that there are created free agents, it follows that there are any number of possible worlds including God‚Äôs existence and also including a contingent state of affairs S such that there is no time at which God can actualize S‚Äù (Plantinga 98). There are possible worlds that God cannot create because he cannot actualize all states of affairs. For example: God cannot actualize a state of affairs that in which a free being will in fact take or refrain from an action. God could not have actualized a state of affairs in which free beings will in fact act morally and always refrain from moral evil, thus God couldn‚Äôt create a world where beings always chose what is morally good.
Response and Counterfactuals</p><p>The atheologian may still remain unconvinced, he or she could respond, ‚Äú[God] may also know, furthermore, that if [He] creates me and causes me to be free in these circumstances, I will refrain from A. If so, there is a state of affairs [He] can actualize, cause to be actual, such that if [He] does so, then I will freely refrain from A‚Äù (Plantinga 98). The Defender is still not safe from the atheologian‚Äôs firepower. How does God‚Äôs foreknowledge of the future affect Plantinga‚Äôs argument? Plantinga launches off into this idea of counterfactuals, he uses the following examples:</p><p>(7) If Curley had been offered $20,000, he would have accepted the bribe.</p><p>(8) If Curley had been offered $20,000, he would have rejected the bribe is true.     (Plantinga 100)</p><p>Plantinga points out that we often make the fatal mistake of assuming that either (7) or (8) must be true. Is every proposition necessarily true or false? On the surface, a reasonable person could easily that only (7) or (8) can be true, and that (if there is an answer at all) one of them must be true now. The Free Will Defender will say that we can‚Äôt possibly know the answer to that question. An example of a counterfactual is: if I was bald, then I would receive an A on my religion seminar paper. The antecedent would be my baldness, and the consequent would be me receiving an A on my religion seminar paper. The counterfactual appears absolutely ludicrous at face value; the consequent does not follow the antecedent. Plantinga shows us that those who believe that either (7) or (8) must be true are making a counterfactual statement. </p><p>We journey further into the possibility of counterfactuals being either true or false. Plantinga asks us to ‚Äúconsider those possible worlds that include its antecedent; and then of these consider that one W that is most similar to the actual world (7) is true if and only if it‚Äôs consequent ‚Äì that is, (9) Curley took the bribe, is true in W. A counterfactual is true if and only if its antecedent is impossible, or its consequent is true in the world most similar to the actual in which its antecedent is‚Äù (Plantinga 100). </p><p>Counterfactuals can only be true in two ways. We must understand that the antecedent doesn‚Äôt actually causally necessitate the consequent. If Curley is free, then no one can know whether or not he would have accepted the bribe. The Defender simply needs to reject the validity of counterfactuals, this allows for a free person to truly act freely, removing the argument (at least for now) that God knows the answers to counterfactuals.</p><p>Of course God can choose whether to create the universe, or whether to create Curley, or whether to make Curley free, but if Curley is made free, then only Curley can choose to refrain or take any given action (in which he is free).</p><p><strong>Leibniz‚Äôs Lapse</strong></p><p>Leibniz and the Objector make the mistake that God can create any possible world, and that God would (by his very nature) choose to create the best of all possible worlds. God clearly cannot create the best of all worlds (not necessarily possible ones), that is: a world with moral good and no moral evil. I agree that Leibniz‚Äôs Lapse is a mistake. Obviously, God is giving a creative power to all his free creatures, or at least that is the case within the Free Will Defence. But, why can we not say that God still didn‚Äôt create the best possible world possible for God to create? An overarching structure of God creating a universe where he did not possess all creative powers might in fact be what he considers to be the better, if not best, of all possible worlds. Leibniz can simply imply that a world with moral good and no moral evil is logically inconsistent with the existence of God, especially in consideration of the actual world. Doesn‚Äôt the Defender arrive at this very conclusion as well? Leibniz isn‚Äôt wrong, his argument simply needs to be put into context. The Free Will Defender still believes that God must create the best of all possible worlds that is possible for God to create, and God can only possibly create worlds in which there will eventually be both moral good and moral evil which result from the free choices of persons within that world.</p><p><strong>Circling Back to His Original Position</strong></p><p>The Free Will Defender employs ‚Äúthe truth that a pair of propositions p and q are jointly consistent if there is a proposition r whose conjunction with p is consistent if there is a proposition r whose conjunction with p is consistent and entails q‚Äù (Plantinga 114). He does not need to show the probability of these possible worlds, in fact, he might not even think anyone could actually know the probability. Plantinga excellently concludes:</p><p>The essential point of the Free Will Defence is that the creation of a world containing moral good is co-operative venture; it requires the uncoerced concurrence of significantly free creatures. But then the actualization of a world W containing moral good is not up to God alone; it also depends upon what the significantly free creatures of W would do if God created them and placed them in the situations W contains. Of course it up to God whether to create free creatures at all; but if he aims to produce moral good, then the must create significantly free creatures upon whose cooperation he must depend. Thus is the power of an omnipotent God limited by the freedom he confers upon his creatures. (Plantinga 115)
	
	Does Plantinga make a good ontological argument? No. In fact, Plantinga simply put theism, and certain types of knowledge, into a new category. Because we can‚Äôt know certain things, and because of how he defines what it means to be free, and because of how he defines what is and is not possible for God to do, both the theist and atheist are left only with a general possibility of God‚Äôs existence. Philosophers of religion are, however, indebted to Plantinga, because this defense gives the theist at least the possibility of holding a logically consistent belief. The theist no longer is clearly making a logically inconsistent statement when they hold the both the existence of God and evil to be simultaneously true.</p><p><strong>Creative Creatures</strong></p><p>Plantinga‚Äôs rigorous argument brings to the forefront of religious philosophy the concepts of personhood and free will. He develops a system that delicately fits together a possible world in which evil and God concurrently exist. Originally, I would have had problems with placing limitations on God. As a Christian, I prefer to think that I have choice (and that keeps me responsible for my sins, and God responsible for no sins); but, I also like to think that God could, and would, at any point He felt necessary prevent me from performing evil actions. In reconciling what it would mean for God to prevent moral evil, and the fact that this doesn‚Äôt appear to happen that often, I have been struck by sense of awe at how much discretion is left to the free person.</p><p>Freedom, at least after reading Plantinga, appears to be so much more than a mere choice to buy jelly beans, to recycle my plastics, or to mow my lawn. For Plantinga‚Äôs argument to work, God has given a gift beyond measure to His free creatures: the ability to create. I believe humans do have God-given free will, and I believe that this requires that God allows me to create specific truths, truths about my faith, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Not only has God allowed me to create, he gives away his ability to control my actions in all circumstances that I act freely. Free will is the power to create.</p><hr><p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p><p>Honderich, Ted. <em>The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</em>.
