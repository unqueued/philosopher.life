<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">What is your idea of a boring evening?</h2><p>I am straight-up addicted to not being bored. I realize that being bored, from time to time, can be a good thing. I hate the feeling. I need another hit off the various kinds of &quot;drugs&quot; in my life (which is far broader than mere substance use, which I barely use at this point). Hell, even this wiki serves as a kind of drug, a constructive one at that though.</p><p>My idea of such an evening is frightening. I'm psychologically dependent upon not being bored. I need bangs and flashes, one after the other...</p><p><em>God fucking damnit. Fine. This prompted introspection is inescapably useful to me.</em></p><p>As I was saying (before I rudely interrupted myself, *ahem*), I need to be titillated, entertained, appeased, surprised, and constantly (with zero interruptions) have my attention focused on something interesting. I refuse to be bored. </p><p>What are the negative effects of not living a life in which I experience more boredom? </p><p>I really don't spend time sitting on the porch. Life moves too fast. I jump from one thing to another, and perhaps I lack the reflection I really need. Is it important to have brainfart, space-out, veg-out time? What is the use in just sitting there? What is the value in being bored? I don't mean to confabulate here. It is something I should investigate. </p><p>Okay, so I'm committed to giving more literal answers here as well (even though the theory is obviously crucially practical). Um, a boring evening would be:</p><ul><li>Zero electricity or battery-powered objects</li><li>Little or no light</li><li>No substances</li><li>No music (even from my own instruments)</li><li>No <strike>bored</strike> board games, magic, etc.</li><li>No books of interest</li><li>It's especially bad if I have no one to talk to. I can survive such an evening just fine if I have people to talk to. In fact, I enjoy those uncommon evenings often enough. It's part of what has led me to walk and talk with my family more often (that sounds sad). </li></ul><p>I mean, being truly bored requires a kind of isolation from everything and everyone I care about (it reminds me of one of the better theological descriptions of Hell). Of course, I'm not sure if I can ever be truly isolated when I have myself in a way (conversing with oneself seems to be the basis of not feeling isolated and truly alone). Maybe being bored, to that degree, is a bad thing. </p><p>There is the phenomenological question (actually many) about boredom. What would Heidegger say? His view, imho, seems far less laced with normativity, except his question-begging about the superiority of the Ready-to-Hand mode. I'm not sure how useful that perspective is here, besides helping me identify what even counts as boredom.</p><p>Maybe the feeling of boredom isn't itself a good thing, but rather from a virtue-theoretic perspective, being someone who experiences sufficient quantities, time-periods, degrees, and kinds of boredom in the right ways at the right times, etc. is living, ultimately, a better kind of life.</p><p>Aristotle warns us about The Calm. Sometimes it seems as if he could be wrong. Diminishing marginal utility often seems like it is only kept in check by taking &quot;tolerance breaks&quot; from those things which give us utility, joy, happiness, pleasure, hedons, etc. Maybe boredom accounts for a tolerance break that ultimately enables us to enjoy the lives and resources available to us in a more efficient, economical, and stable way. Boredom allows us to more effectively lick the spoon, suck the marrow, etc. out of life.</p><p>Is it conceptually possible to embed boredom in the notion of carpe diem?</p><p>Clearly, there is much I do not understand here.</p></div>
