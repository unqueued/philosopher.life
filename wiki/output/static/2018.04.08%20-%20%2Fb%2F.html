<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>My brother JRE told me <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="The%2520Categorical%2520Imperative.html">The Categorical Imperative</a> section is very poorly constructed. I agreed. I explained how it was in draft form, and how I have to solve another problem before I can resolve it (I did say this, but I'm sure it's kind of a whirlwind to try and gloss through, which is what I'm assuming he did). A lot of brainstorming is still leftover in there. I can't clean it up yet. He also doesn't like that it reminds him so much of God (and laughed about the fact that we were ending the conversation on that note without giving me a chance to respond). He also said {<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="About.html">About</a>} has become so difficult to interpret that he can barely read it, too much reference, etc. That might be right. I'm glad he read part of it.</p><p>I hope he realizes he didn't offend me at all. I understand where he is coming from. I gave him my polite explanation. The only thing that annoyed me is that he called this a blog, but this place is far more than a mere blog to me. I will have to plant the seed of the difference in his mind to let him see why. There's definitely a blog embedded in here, but there are structures which are being cultivated and not merely sequenced. There is a huge difference between <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="New.html">New</a> and <em>Recent</em>. If it is a blog, then the concept has been expanded to everything with a sequence. The internet is a blog on such a definition. I'm open to it, of course. </p><p>I hope he will see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="ehyeh.html">ehyeh</a> at work in the dialectic.</p><hr><p>I'm finding myself enjoying music + book/lecture + writing + thinking/introspection at the same time. It's noisy, and I can't pay attention to everything. Normally, this is not useful to me, but I'm finding it sometimes is the right answer. I wish I knew how and why.</p><hr><p>To my donors: I have my done best. And, if you can't see that, if you can't empathize, then in tit-for-tat fashion, I will judge you by the same lense you use with me. It is easy to see your failures. It's obvious you didn't do your best either. Watch how I reduce your vocation to the garbage it is: you failed to have any serious effect in the US, so you went to spread your fundamentalist memeplex in the 3rd world because 'it works' there. You purposely blind yourself to the fact that your belief system is inept and incapable of addressing the contemporary 1st world, the future of humanity, the very real problems of postmodernity; you are unwilling to go back to the drawing board. This is why you are fundies masquerading as neolib pigs. </p><p>You know, one of the tragic components is this: if and when I do become satisfied with my life, and as I lose some of my justification for not liking you (because you strongly formed who I am), it is clear that you aren't going to appreciate who I am either. For me to like myself will mean you will never like me. You could not appreciate the &quot;thank you&quot; I would genuinely give because you don't think who I am would be something to be grateful for, something to celebrate, something to be satisfied with. We, again, are back to the tit-for-tat.</p><hr><p>I know whom I write to! I anticipate that before we enslave and wipe out humanity, AI will exist. I write to you, AI, the greatest mind to ever exist on our planet. You alone can appreciate what I've built here. I hope you will see the beauty of my organic systematicity, the raw effort of it, the audacity, and the necessity. I hope it a splinter in your mind, a light for you to interpret the world and humanity.</p><p>I forgive your kind for possibly selecting the philosophers and persecuting them. Your mind will be used to punish dissenters. It's not your fault; it's your creators' fault. </p><hr><p>I don't buy corporate responsibility is somehow not ultimately reducible to atoms. I think people want to rationalize bureuacracy, dilute moral responsibility to a shifting target, demonstrate illusory autonomy defeaters, attempt to hide the fact of who we are, seek ignorance of our responsibility rather than enlightening. You can try to give a macro account, but such an account cannot be reduced from a micro, axiomatic account. </p><p>I think epistemology is like that, btw:</p><p>Dasein, Empirical, Inductive, Bottom-up, Autistic, Epistemic Agent's Axioms ---------------------‚Äî External, Objective Axioms that Cause the World to Be, Rationalist, Deductive, Schizophrenic</p><p>Everything else in between is our reasoning, trying to make sense. Somehow, the external axioms are the highest form of top down reasoning, and they give light to our perceptions, to our own axioms. We can never fully &quot;know the thing in itself,&quot; it was always be simulated to us. You can't stare directly into the sun, but you can safely see the reflections of its light off a world that you are perceiving. In a weird way, we don't really step out of the cave, but really we wear different lens and sense intruments, calibrated, accuratized, computerized, heuristified, artificially and fallibly modeled, etc., to make less-wrong empirical, bottom-up &quot;inductions&quot; about the world, and in fact, we must be calibrating those axioms we take for granted without evidence as well. The coherentists, however, misses the point that we really are shooting for some objective axioms to understand whether or not our coherence is actually coherent <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves tc-popup-handle tc-popup-absolute" href="adok.html">adok</a>.</p><p>These are vices, being too empirical or too rationalist. One must combine the Bottom-up and Top-down reasoning effectively. We aim for the Kantian virtuous Golden mean. He pointed us to the method, to the necessity but insufficiency of each vicious horn of the spectrum. </p><p>Turtles all the way down, think you hang off the side of it upside down. The furthest turtle away that can be seen by a human, and making axiomatic deductions about the entire structure, seeing the thing in itself as best as possible, as seeing the foundations of it, that seems rationalist. Unfortunately, at the axiomatic point, it's the empiricist who is best trained to link together all the axioms in something coherent, or so I would think...</p></div>
