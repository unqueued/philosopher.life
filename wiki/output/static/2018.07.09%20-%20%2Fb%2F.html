Do not defend or explain your own argument; just rhetorically point to the authority. It is true: sometimes that is all we can feasibly manage.

There is plenty of content wrapped up in what you said, and I don't think it was a dumb question. It does seem reasonable to ask for your particular representation of a technical and arguably still controversial worry (we're still responding to Kant). It seems reasonable to rehearse your view on and use of Kant here. Perhaps I'm wrong. In any case, if you don't feel like answering, just be kindly honest (it's not that hard) or silent.</p><p>Maybe I need to work on my sneering and &quot;tbh&quot; one-liners.
