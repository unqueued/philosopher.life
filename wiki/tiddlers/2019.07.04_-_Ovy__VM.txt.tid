12:24 AM] h0p3: Yup, that's it.
[12:24 AM] h0p3: 1 core, 1GB of RAM, and use this more lightweight version of Ubuntu called Xubuntu: https://xubuntu.org/download
Xubuntu
Pasi Lallinaho
Download Xubuntu « Xubuntu
Xubuntu – Xubuntu is an elegant and easy-to-use operating system.
[9:18 AM] Valdus: Hold on let me get something a bit more updated let me get a computer screenshot of drives.
[11:41 AM] Valdus: now I have a word counter!
[12:27 PM] h0p3: Yay!
[12:28 PM] Valdus: and a bit better contrasting light palette
[12:28 PM] h0p3: That is awesome.
[12:28 PM] h0p3: I am glad it is coming alive for you.
[12:29 PM] Valdus: Im a visual whore, cant do anything without the right environment
[12:29 PM] h0p3: Ha. I can appreciate that.
[12:29 PM] Valdus: yours is beautiful.
[12:31 PM] h0p3: Thank you. It keeps changing. Some have compared it to an LSD trip, and I kinda like that. Dark and Neon Colors.
[12:40 PM] Valdus: Im sure that was the feeling you were going for.
[12:42 PM] Valdus: so let me see when I can get back to work under the hood.
[2:06 PM] Valdus: so wht is this json file that gets saved everytime I hit check is that save trail?
[2:33 PM] h0p3: Look inside it
[2:33 PM] h0p3: That is a .tid file converted into .json format.
[8:43 PM] Valdus: I sense you doing wiki-work
[8:43 PM] h0p3: Ha.
[8:43 PM] h0p3: Tru dat
[8:43 PM] Valdus: Lol knew it
[8:43 PM] h0p3: The whole family pitched in to remodel my wife's wiki today.
[8:43 PM] h0p3: It's been a lot of work today.
[8:43 PM] Valdus: I need to hire your family
[8:44 PM] h0p3: I aim to give my time freely to you.
[8:44 PM] h0p3: I am, of course, religious about the wiki, lol.
[8:45 PM] h0p3: How's your wiki work going, btw?
[8:45 PM] Valdus: You should write a wiki manifesto (or have you?)
[8:45 PM] h0p3: You played with any of the settings or installed any plugins?
[8:46 PM] h0p3: My wiki is really, really big. It would fill a small bookcase. I have many rantings and manifestos. I am a lunatic! :smiley:
[8:48 PM] Valdus: I installed word count, savetrail on CB is annoying and it does everything like saveas which is also annoying. Found a better palette among the choices and decided my journaling will not be in sections within a toddler but just make a tiddler for it.
[8:49 PM] h0p3: I sent you a link to how to modify Chromium (or Chrome) to make it far more comfortable.
[8:49 PM] h0p3: That annoyance can be taken care of.
[8:50 PM] h0p3: Knowing how far to atomize your content into individual tiddlers is not as easy problem. Unfortunately, I have little advice I can give. I think I'm a failure on that front.
[8:50 PM] h0p3: Just remember that you can transform the data again and again. It's hard to screw up so bad you can't undo it.
[8:50 PM] h0p3: TW is designed to evolve.
[8:52 PM] Valdus: @i have specific things like RAGE PAGE and The Stupidity Machine (what I call my body once I hit late 40’s) which I just put in its own tiddly
[8:53 PM] Valdus: Evolve, careful it don’t become self aware amigo!
[8:54 PM] h0p3: Lol. Sounds like you are well on your way to make it your own.
[8:54 PM] h0p3: I do intend to do machine learning with my wiki.
[8:54 PM] Valdus: Sent link by email?
[8:54 PM] Valdus: Machine learning?
[8:55 PM] h0p3: Yup. I think I'll be able to build very strong webcrawlers, music recommendations, and perhaps even a bot that sounds like me.
[8:55 PM] h0p3: I have ~22k links to the internet in my wiki, I believe. It's like bookmark heaven, and I think that will eventually be useful for helping me curate information which suits me.
[8:57 PM] Valdus: No doubt
[8:59 PM] Valdus: Link?
[8:59 PM] h0p3: Sorry, off in my own head! Lemme find it.
[9:01 PM] Valdus: I live my whoooole life in my head. No prob
[9:01 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Wiki%3A%20Chromium%20Setup
[9:02 PM] h0p3: Browser tweaks and addons/extensions give you a completely new layer to work with.
[9:05 PM] Valdus: Lol which one do I pick for the annoy-save?
[9:07 PM] h0p3: Check the Stop [[AA]]oying Me section
[9:09 PM] Valdus: Uhm, not a link only text?
[9:09 PM] h0p3: Google is your friend here.
[9:09 PM] h0p3: Even the links I have on that page are to particular scripts.
[9:10 PM] Valdus: Huh?
[9:20 PM] Valdus: got one, but is there anything to stop the save window altogether?
[9:20 PM] Valdus: just save where I got it from idiot!
[9:21 PM] h0p3: I don't have a fresh instance to test it. You should be able to disable the download bar, overwrite existing files without the nag, and tell it to automatically save.
[9:22 PM] Valdus: well the first one just doesnt put a number on the save
[9:27 PM] Valdus: worked, love you man!
[9:34 PM] h0p3: Awesome.
[9:34 PM] h0p3: You show your wife your wiki?
[9:34 PM] Valdus: wow this is a whole new world, No. Im an only child, Im used to having secrets.
[9:35 PM] Valdus: well I got to go upstairs, apparently my son escaped there.
[9:35 PM] Valdus: thanks for it all , man
[9:35 PM] h0p3: take it is easy, ttyl :smiley:
