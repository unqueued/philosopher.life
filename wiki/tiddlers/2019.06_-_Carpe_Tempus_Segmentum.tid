!! Audit:

* I masturbate a fuckton. =)
* I have been watching a ton of SC2, and I'm grateful for my coffeebliss.
* I've done an okay job finding ways to exercise at least once each day (generally). I think it's been good for the family too.
* You can see where our finances become more stable. I am also incredibly grateful.
* My daughter still doesn't have her phone set.
* Some of my sleep schedule is really fucked up. Usually once every two weeks it's crazy bad.
* Also, the walk-in on my climax was unknown to him, but it was explained. 
* We've been making due without a dryer, but we still need to get one.
** My wife doesn't want to buy new because this apartment seems to eat them.
* Tons of dialectures! =) GJ!
* Science about my lube and allergy
* I've been eating a lot of fruits and nuts. I can't say I've lost weight, and I still have my gut. I look like a regular construction worker.
* I've been drinking too much. =(
* I've been having a harder time connecting with my brother [[JRE]]. Feels like distance to me.
* Whoa. Another dark one in here. Surprised it didn't get olvoldy'd.
* I've done a garbage job reading from books. 
** Or what I've read has been stupid
