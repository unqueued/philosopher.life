title: 2019.05.01 - Wiki Audit: EditorCounter

I've been eyeing $:/plugins/telmiger/EditorCounter for a while. Set to 1000 character for autosave. [[j3d1h]] is setting the plugin's characters to non-black for me because it doesn't show up. 

Once in a while, I'm interested to know my word count. This may be a useful tool for that as well. The autosave may or may not be worth my time. I know that when I'm working on [[m14]], I'm constantly saving (this still might be a pain in the ass because I can't use extensions to hide saving popups and whatnot) because I'm still not confident that I won't be losing work. I do the same out of habit everywhere though. 

I am marginally concerned about accidentally saving content that I'd prefer to have manual control over. Will I remember to uncheck autosave for such occasions? I don't know. This is a trial run, I guess.

Telmiger builds interesting plugins, but their value is not always obvious to me.

The saving mechanism doesn't work with any consistency. Nope. That's not useful enough. It's gone, and it required removing tiddlers by hand. Eww.

Uh...Even after reloading and deleting the plugin again, I'm stuck with shadowtiddlers. I don't recall running into this problem before, and I'm going to bet this is a Bob problem.
