title: Outopos: Sharing Computational Resources

Outopos should work to support whatever containers are necessary. Being platform agnostic/universal is highly prized. Extreme efficiency, usability, and safety are paramount. Docker seems to be the best tool available right now, but Outopos could move on to do many things.

The goal is to seemlessly enable users to share resources with other users in a safe, efficient, and reliable manner. A currency of computational resources flows forth. Trust becomes empowered when backed by the power of shared computation.
