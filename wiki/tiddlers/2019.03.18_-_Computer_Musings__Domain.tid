title: 2019.03.18 - Computer Musings: Domain

Domain renewed. We have passed another year. Another year, another $26. Compared to Dallas, it's a ripoff. It's not worth my time for the money to do anything else.

I will miss you KS. You did right by me. You aren't worth my money anymore.

Three options with [[m16]]:

* Disable fans manually
** Expensive if it doesn't work.
** My money is on it not working!
** BIOS won't let me undo it, and I can't hack that shit.
* Sell it and try again.
** There's nothing else even in the same league as this. You need RAM, homie.
* Run it outside with fans.
** You can drill that hole. You have the tools. Run a pipe, do a wirepull, and you are set.
*** Ask your brother. Duh doy.
** I don't want to thin client to it. 
*** I have plenty of ethernet, dropcords, USB extension, and even an HDMI cord that can go that length (such a badass).
** This setup only works here. If you move, you will have this problem again.
*** You'll have to fix it back before you move out.
** Gonna be a pain in the ass to have to go out back to the shed to flip a switch, etc.

The GPD's are looking so fucking hawt. I'm straight up horny. It's so beautiful. That would go well in my pocket. Tether that shit, or maybe even sim (one day, they'll have it). My god. An actual server at home for desktop and that as my palmtop. Please let me live in x86_64 land. I was a huge netbook fan. My bugout bag still has a clean, ancient one.
