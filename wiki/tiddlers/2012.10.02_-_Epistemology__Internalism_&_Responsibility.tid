Infinite Regress Concern

Perhaps I have misunderstood something important (if so, please correct me).

My concern below isn’t directly about the arguments provided by Foley and Wolterstorff (although I do find this issue of entitlement to be fascinating), rather their discussion brings up a concern for me. 

In analyzing Foley’s argument, Wolterstorff provides a seemingly useful paradigm of belief and meta-belief. In particular, on pg. 335, Wolterstorff says:

“One responsibly believes a proposition P, Foley suggests, in case one has the epistemically rational meta-belief that the processes whereby one acquired and sustained the belief that P were sufficiently likely to be successful.”

So, we have a belief P. Let us call P a first-order belief. The meta-belief in question is a belief about P, in particular, it is a belief that we have a sufficiently reliable method of acquiring and maintaining belief in P (right?). Meta-beliefs are beliefs about first-order beliefs. Meta-beliefs are basically second-order beliefs, as they are the justifying or responsible-making force behind or about first-order beliefs.

The question is then: Do we need to justify second-order beliefs? Are we responsible for our second-order beliefs? I don’t see why not. What then justifies or makes us responsible for our second-order beliefs? I can only assume, on this model, that we need third-order beliefs to justify or make us responsible for our second-order beliefs. And, if so, doesn't this process of adding orders of beliefs continue ad infinitum? My worry is that we face a kind of infinite regress where we never really justify our first-order beliefs. 

It seems as though relying upon some of my beliefs to justify other beliefs I have is circular, too subjective, and somehow failing to resoundingly resolve the issue of justifying my beliefs. Perhaps I'm being uncharitable and reductionist here (this *is* my first epistemic rodeo - I am bound to make huge errors). Perhaps my concern is too elementary or maybe I’m missing something obvious (and I apologize if that's the case). Ideas anyone?

I think we’ve briefly considered this concern in class, but now I’m struggling with it more forcefully.
