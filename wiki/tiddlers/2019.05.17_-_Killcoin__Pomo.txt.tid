A dumb show.

Propaganda
12 MIN AGO
My wife loves it, and I love my wife.
12 MIN AGO
I'm watching Easy.  It's a stupid show as well.
12 MIN AGO
Sooooo, ergo, you like it?  Or like it enough to endure it?
12 MIN AGO
I have deeply mixed feelings about the show. Sometimes I crack up. We have to pause the show to talk about it. Othertimes, I am furious with the show. It is a wide range. Usually, however, it is chill and it doesn't matter whether I pay attention or not.
11 MIN AGO
That's kind of how this show is.  I can discord, I can take pics, all while watching and not miss much.
10 MIN AGO
It is our background narrative.
10 MIN AGO
How you been?
5 MIN AGO
Been fighting an infection, been fairly stressed, but life has been good.

13 MIN AGO
Also watching the tailend of Venture Bros again. I've watched the first 5 many times, but I've not paid enough attention to the last couple.
13 MIN AGO
Sure. It's an interesting show.
12 MIN AGO
Hmmm, maybe I'll give it a peak.
10 MIN AGO
Currently going through this list roughly top to bottom with the kiddos: https://philosopher.life/#TV%3A%20Library
10 MIN AGO
I've been wanting to rewatch Sex and the City too.
9 MIN AGO
My goal is to have a strong memebase with them. We need stories, metaphors, and myths to think about.
9 MIN AGO
I've not seen the show.
9 MIN AGO
Discord is something I still just can't seem to get into. I use it for technical help, connecting with some individuals who prefer it as a medium, and group chat sometimes. How do you use it?
24 MIN AGO
Umm, I'm a member of a few groups and a mod of one.
12 MIN AGO
Most are collecting groups
12 MIN AGO
You have a very interesting pick of shows.
11 MIN AGO
Definitely post-modern there.
11 MIN AGO
Lol.
10 MIN AGO

10 MIN AGO
Where's the Green Acres?

9 MIN AGO
One of these days, Alice.... To the MOON!

I mean dude, you're basically a Reddit Brah
7 MIN AGO
It's true.
6 MIN AGO
Been using Reddit for a long time.
6 MIN AGO
It's bleeding through to your wiki.
6 MIN AGO
Though most of these shows were not from Reddit
6 MIN AGO
Glubadubglubglub!
5 MIN AGO
Ah, that's not where it really bleeds through.
5 MIN AGO
They sit there and jerk off to R and M
5 MIN AGO
I'm a huge a fan.
5 MIN AGO
Blow their load over some Seuchan sauce.
5 MIN AGO
Noooo!
5 MIN AGO
Not everyone can appreciate the depth of the show, ofc.
4 MIN AGO
Sorry, I have a love hate relationship with Reddit.
4 MIN AGO
Mainly hate.
4 MIN AGO
It's hard to speak of it monolithically
4 MIN AGO
And it's gotten worse since they've banned all the good subs.
4 MIN AGO
No, it's really not.
4 MIN AGO
I was not a fan of their censorship.
4 MIN AGO
It's one huge SJW circle-jerk.  Mainly progressive/liberal minding ideology that they're trying to force upon the rest of the site.
3 MIN AGO
I agree that plays a significant role.
3 MIN AGO
How dare you not vaccinate your newborn child or how dare you circumcise them.
3 MIN AGO
Don't you spank that kid!!!
3 MIN AGO
Fuck off.
3 MIN AGO
My usage of it has decreased dramatically in the past year.
3 MIN AGO
How have you have systematically explored it?
2 MIN AGO
Dude, I have been from one end of it to the other.
2 MIN AGO
Yeah, lol. Me too. EZ.
2 MIN AGO
It's just that one end keeps getting closer to the middle because they are banning more and more of it.
2 MIN AGO
I'm afraid you do not pay enough attention.
1 MIN AGO
It's okay /pat
1 MIN AGO
Explain?
1 MIN AGO
It's being largely squeezed toward the left of the Overton Window, but I see significant censorship of those to both extreme left and right.
1 MIN AGO
BAHAHAHAHAHA
1 MIN AGO
That's the dumbest shit I've ever hear [[h0p3]].
NOW
I hear ya
NOW
They might clip some posts from some far lefties like "all slave owners deserve to die" but they're cutting out whole subs from the other end.
