title: 2018.07.30 - JRE: Crystal

JRE talked about his new work place. He did a really good job, and it wasn't recognized. I hate that for him. Rebecca is finally recognizing that it has crystallized for him, not going to have children. JRE is thinking about options. He's received lots of similar comments about "not being ready for kids" or fulfillment considerations. He knows things are going south.

He talked about doing the van thing and traveling. This will be difficult for the gaming rig. I think he's trying to find a way to preserve the relationship with Rebecca. He doesn't sound hopeful. I am sorry. =(

I talked about my conversation with [[Adam Nemecek]]. I did a poor job. I talked about what the kids and I were doing, and that we were almost done. I think ran out of fucks to give, understandably. I wish I could give him a hug. He needs a shoulder to cry on right now.

I told him that if he needs to use me as a soundingboard without my opinions to give me a keyword: "I need to use you as a sounding board." I'm not sure how to do this well, but I will read more about it and practice.
