I like how the two are almost contrary to each other.
20 MIN AGO
Oh no sah
20 MIN AGO
Totally joking on number two, either I'm attracted or not, I don't think I could not be and still bang a girl.
19 MIN AGO
Plus I ain't done no fornicatin' since the incident and I'm trying to be good.
17 MIN AGO
Is he typing, is he not typing.  We may never know.
15 MIN AGO
I'm a slow typist.
15 MIN AGO
Yeah, right.
15 MIN AGO
We lived together for a year, amte.
15 MIN AGO
mate.
15 MIN AGO
I agree it's not a catfish. But, since you would stop seeking a relationship with a woman because you eventually found out her son is multi-racial...it has a bit in common. Attractiveness at first can turn out to be deceptive to the pursuer, as catfishing can sometimes be.
14 MIN AGO
I'd bang her!
14 MIN AGO
I feel like you're making this more complicated than it really is.
13 MIN AGO
Trying to go all Jung on me for a meme.
13 MIN AGO
I'm terrible like that. Sorry. That they appeared contrary to me was amusing.\
13 MIN AGO
A girl can lose weight, she can't undo that black dick.
12 MIN AGO
Lol.
12 MIN AGO
Once a coal burner, always a coal burner.
12 MIN AGO
It's like the joke, a guy can build a thousand bridges and suck one cock, and to the world he isn't a bridge builder, he's a cocksucker.
12 MIN AGO
I don't think I'm that Jungian, btw. I agree with some initial points of his theory, but I just don't understand the archetypes well enough. I'm probably not well-versed enough. It's something I need to continue thinking about.
11 MIN AGO
You have nailed all the essentials down, sir.
11 MIN AGO
As always, the Gospel according to Matt.
10 MIN AGO
Lol.
10 MIN AGO
How's work going for ya?
9 MIN AGO
Really good actually, I'm getting the hang of it and doing a decent job (I hope).
9 MIN AGO
It's enjoyable.
9 MIN AGO
I have no doubt you are excelling.
9 MIN AGO
As busy as you wanna be and interesting, never a dull call.
9 MIN AGO
What's your favorite and least favorite aspects of it so far?
8 MIN AGO
Least favorite part, hmm, documenting?  It's one of those you have to document everything and then document it again type of thing.
7 MIN AGO
Sounds like a chance to automate, possibly.
7 MIN AGO
Best part is it's never the same.  Each accident is different than the last one and each call is different.
6 MIN AGO
The stupidity of people is amazing.
6 MIN AGO
Do you think that novelty will hold, or will you begin to see enough patterns that it will stop feeling different eventually?
6 MIN AGO
And, ofc, I agree...amazing.
6 MIN AGO
Eh, you really the patterns are there, but like I said, each person you talk to is different and each call is different.
5 MIN AGO
Each accident may be the same but it's never going to play out the same.
5 MIN AGO
A person may say the wrong thing in the recorded interview and you can investigate a little more or look at something you didn't see before.
4 MIN AGO
I'm not wanting to do it for a long time, I plan on moving out and moving up.
4 MIN AGO
ASAP
4 MIN AGO
But it'll hold.
4 MIN AGO
I'll recommend The Gervais Principle again.
3 MIN AGO
May it be useful to you in your endeavors.

I had one of our customers start cussing me out because I was trying to get her to take her car to one of our repair shops.
2 MIN AGO
Instead she wanted to use this dealer, and I couldn't find the dealer in our system, tried to look for 15 minutes just to find it even out of our system, finally after cussing at me the guy got his cell and called the dealership and turns out, they didn't have a body shop.
2 MIN AGO
So that pissed them off, then the call just went downhill from there.. it was actually quite comedic.
1 MIN AGO
I was trying not to laugh at how absurd the lady and her boyfriend were being... she wanted him (who wasn't even in the car with her at the time of the accident) give me HER recorded statement.
NOW
I was like ma'am, he can't give me your recorded statement, it needs to be from you.
NOW
"OH FUCK WELL FINE"
NOW
lol
NOW
Yeah, good times.  I hung up and just burst out laughing.
20 MIN AGO
Told my boss get ready for a lawsuit because "they're gonna sue the fuck out of us"
20 MIN AGO
What'd your boss say to that?
20 MIN AGO
She told me I might want to call the lady's agent and fill them in on what was going on.
20 MIN AGO
We're just a voice on the phone, it's easy to kick the dog when it isn't your dog.
19 MIN AGO
Makes sense.
19 MIN AGO
They were aware of her temperment.
19 MIN AGO
I am shocked.
18 MIN AGO
Right?

17 MIN AGO
I don't think you're a fan of country, this song might be decent though.
17 MIN AGO
Aye. Not a fan. I want to be. I like a Cash song here and there, maybe some Denver.
15 MIN AGO
It's a song about heartbreak from a woman, should have known it wouldn't click.
14 MIN AGO
Traditionally, that is good material for a song.
14 MIN AGO
RIght.

13 MIN AGO
I'll redeem myself.
13 MIN AGO
I like the tone. I don't even know what to call it.
12 MIN AGO
It's a cheerful suicide song.
12 MIN AGO
Perfect.
11 MIN AGO
Have you heard their other stuff
11 MIN AGO
Never heard of them at all.
11 MIN AGO
ok nigga, hold up

11 MIN AGO
Listen in that order.
10 MIN AGO
They're a cholo rapcore band?
10 MIN AGO
They are fans of Eminem.
10 MIN AGO
I think the value of the song is too reliant upon caring about the lyrics to fit me. The sound is playful.
8 MIN AGO
They'd prolly fuck em up in real life, on the rap stage he'd murder them.
8 MIN AGO
Latter song feels like rock band that I know you know, (maybe a Christian Rock band?), can't put my finger on them, tip of my tongue, can't name a song.
5 MIN AGO
You know, I don't think I've ever dated a girl that could sing.
5 MIN AGO
Better to fill their mouth.
5 MIN AGO
I'm watching some chick bands right now... I think that would be awesome.
5 MIN AGO
lol, you'd have to worry about damaging the vocal chords.
4 MIN AGO
Well, I wouldn't have to.
4 MIN AGO
lol.
3 MIN AGO
You have picked up a sense of self-deprecating humor in the past decade. I like it.
