[1:32 PM] Valdus: You play videogames?
[1:33 PM] h0p3: Long ago, I was an addict.
[1:34 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Games
[1:34 PM] h0p3: How about you?
[1:45 PM] Valdus: Because I wanted to gift you a game that’s very close to my heart but didn’t want to assume. Hell you might have it.
[1:46 PM] h0p3: What games are close to your heart? You seem to have a ton of experience.
[1:47 PM] Valdus: Tropico
[1:47 PM] Valdus: You on steam?
[1:49 PM] h0p3: I have an account, but I've not installed it in a long time. I appreciate the gesture. I have an obsessive personality, and games are like pure drugs to me. I used to play Everquest 12 hours a day.
[1:49 PM] h0p3: I can't trust myself with video games. Lol.
[1:50 PM] h0p3: My wiki is probably the closest thing to a video game I play.
[1:50 PM] Valdus: Oooooook well I just played 4 hours of Tropico on iPad and thought wow, hop3 is pretty awesome for doing all that.
[1:51 PM] h0p3: You sound like you have way more self-control than I do. What makes Tropico close to your heart?
[1:57 PM] Valdus: You’re the ruler of a 1950’s Caribbean island- I’m Cuban!
[2:25 PM] Valdus: Love the shittle out of it.
[8:18 PM] Valdus: alright to get this specific wiki floating in the house. Im upstairs on my ipad (which is an ext network so not sure it will work) and I want to write, and frak I can't.
[8:43 PM] Valdus: and man again, I love this stuff. Let me get a backup on my zip drive.
[9:18 PM] h0p3: It depends on how you extend your network.
[9:18 PM] h0p3: Wait, but you aren't using a webserver, you are doing this through synced single html files.
[9:19 PM] h0p3: You will definitely have to give running the nodejs variants again. Multi-device has an asychronous locking problem. Beware saving over new work with older work. You have to reload on the last device to edit.
[9:19 PM] h0p3: I'm glad you are loving it. I keep automated versioning, backups, and manual backups in a variety of ways. I cannot recommend it enough.
[9:38 PM] Valdus: ok what would be the most basic webserver I can use for this?
[9:39 PM] Valdus: I mean do you use a webserver for your wiki scrolls?
[9:46 PM] h0p3: I mean, I use Bob, which is the tiddlywiki nodejs server with some tools added on top, as my develoment environment.
[9:46 PM] h0p3: My primary method of serving the wiki to the public is through git
[9:47 PM] h0p3: https://github.com/m6ram/

[9:48 PM] h0p3: peace
