Is the gut part of the limbic system in the end? Some parts of me compromise my essential me-ness more than others, to various [[dok]]. My symbiotic relationship with my gut biome seems like it's more important to my identity than my fingernails (I treasure them so much, they are fun to chew on, though now I cut them off before chewing on them). I don't know enough biology to answer the question meaningfully yet, but my gut leans toward "yes" on it. =)
