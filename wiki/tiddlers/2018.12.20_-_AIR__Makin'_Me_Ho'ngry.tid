He felt content today at work. He didn't explain exactly how or why. He did talk to his peer Mark, who broke down crying about their boss. Shit was fucked. I think they are less alone together in being able to empathize. Clearly, they are both being alienated from themselves through their psychopathic boss-chains' actions. It is interesting to see that Mark doesn't believe a word of that Dan says anymore after a decade either.

My brother and I talked a bit about the wikis. We talked about tagging a bit. My brother is writing in google docs first and then transplanting it in. I'm trying to encourage him to embrace the tool. We talked about the kids. It got really late and he needed to go to bed. I am glad he called me.
