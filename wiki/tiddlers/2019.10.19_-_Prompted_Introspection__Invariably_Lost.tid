title: 2019.10.19 - Prompted Introspection: Invariably Lost

!! If you were lost in the woods and it got dark, what would you do?

The answer in [[2017.06.16 - Prompted Introspection Log]] seems fair to me. Thinking again about it, I want to know exactly how I got lost in the woods. It would be unlike me to overextend myself into that situation. It's difficult to know the [[dok]] I would be lost as well. The answer is going to vary with more information.
