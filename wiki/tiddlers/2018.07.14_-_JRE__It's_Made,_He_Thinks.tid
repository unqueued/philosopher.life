title: 2018.07.14 - JRE: It's Made, He Thinks

My brother JRE and I talked about his work for quite a while. He covered for one of his apprentices. I hope to be as good a jman as he is. We still may have some disagreements on the normativity of work ethic and requirements in capitalism. I'm doing a poor job explaining myself, as usual. His workplace is complex. I appreciate his taking the time to explain it to me, to think about it with me. I enjoy hearing the story of his life.

We talked about the what I'm doing on my wiki. He listens. I'm not sure what he thinks usually on the matter. I'm going to assume it's boring, tedious, etc. because it is! It is clear he has been paying attention to my words though, and that matters a great deal to me.

We talked about the perhaps probable end of his relationship. I told him I'm here to support him. I can see both ways, and I want him to be happy. I try to think about both stories with him because I hope he's doing the same with himself in his wiki (I would not be surprised at all if he has been). I think he will be happier in the end for having taken the reins of himself in either direction, both of which are painful. I worry I'm failing to empathize effectively enough with him. I worry I'm not listening closely enough to his words either. I'm trying to feel it with him, and I have to say, it is intense. 

He may need me in person very soon. It is a goal to make myself available to him with little notice.

We talked a bit about AA&UJ's book right before the end.
