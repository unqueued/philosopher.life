//I'malaphor this.//

* We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.
* You're not the quickest crayon in the box.
* You're not the sharpest needle in the haystack.
* Sorry to rain on your thunder.
* Until the cows freeze over.
* You've opened this can of worms, now lie in it.
* Shit or get out of the kitchen.
* It's not rocket surgery.
* It's not brain science.
* That's a tough nut to swallow.
* Does the pope shit in the woods?
* Let's not beat around the dead horse.
* It's like pulling teeth from a baby.
* A bird in the stink is worth two in the pink.
* No skin off my balls. 
* Welcome to my shoes.
* Don’t put all your chickens in one basket before they’ve hatched.
* You hit the nail right on the nose.
* As easy as shooting a piece of cake...
* Actions speak louder than a thousand words.
* You’re barking up the wrong side of the bed.
