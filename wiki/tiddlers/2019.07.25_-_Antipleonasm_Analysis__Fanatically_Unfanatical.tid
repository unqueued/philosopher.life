title: 2019.07.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Fanatically Unfanatical

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The source of totalitarianism is a dogmatic attachment to the official word: the lack of laughter, of ironic detachment. An excessive commitment to Good may in itself become the greatest Evil: real Evil is any kind of fanatical dogmatism, especially exerted in the name of supreme Good.

KYS.

Like that, [[right]]? Lol. JK, you said the word "may," and now I have to let you off the hook because of a technicality, you fucking "Cultural Marxist"<<ref "t">> bastard, you.

It's so easy to just say what you've said (it's a very popular notion), and moreover, I suggest many people wield it to great evil as well. Watch me say it just as circularly: the source of unjustified centralized power is unjustified confidence in one's belief about what matters. You are blowing my god damned mind! I agree evil praxis results from evil doxa: [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. Preach, yo! Now, just to be clear: you agree [[DOR]], right? Otherwise, fuck off.

Of course, I get to ironically laugh at any dogmatic attachment to this decontextualized literal argument as the official word, right? Your argument implodes on itself. It's correct, and its inverse also seems correct; trying to explain how the two dialectally meet is arguably what we are doing in philosophy. What does it mean to be dogmatically undogmatic [[irwartfrr]]? 

You either believe there is an objective [[Good]] or you don't. I'm not going to let you have it both ways (though you made the out). There are places where I will not be tolerant, but I will listen carefully. I agree we can be radically wrong about what counts as [[The Good]], but pursuing it with everything we have is conceptually [[right]] (and [[Good]] qua personhood, i.e. our purpose). Further, I agree moderation is a virtue, and yet virtue is an objective, exact, codifiable, particularized, anti-luck, and fully real property of at least one branch of any person's identity at every timeslice in which they are a person. 

An argument that someone is evil can only be justified on a dogmatic assumption that there is an increasingly knowable [[Good]] and evil.<<ref "c">> [[TOP]] is the only fair method for intersubjective voting on a shared representation of [[The Good]]; that's the tricky part.
