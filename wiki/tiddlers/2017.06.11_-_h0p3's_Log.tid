!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

I'm doing well enough. I passed my drug tests! I've not been getting enough sleep, but I've been getting at least 6 hours each night. I need to push harder to secure myself 7.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

I played EQ for a week. It was amazing. It was a private server designed for botting. It was customized entirely for using MQ2 scripting. It was amazing. Amazing! It has to be one of the best games I've ever played in my life (in fact, I think it is the best I've ever played). I had to quit though. I saw that it took up too much of my attention, energy, time, resources, etc. My life begins to warp around it. It prevented me from being who I need to be.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

The game was extremely addictive. I'm lucky to have escaped it. The wiki was my evidence, and DCK gave me the willpower to destroy my VM and write about it, to make the decision to overcome my akrasia. 

I am at the same time grateful for how much the game taught me about life, to work hard in the grind, to be passionate, how it gave me the tools to understand myself and world, and the raw pleasure of the experience, but also fearful and wary of touching the substance. I know how little self-control I have around it. At this level of addiction, I can only go all or nothing. There is no in between, I hate to say it. I just don't have the self-control to hit the golden means! =( It is the wise thing to do though.

EQ is a helluva a drug!

I would like to point out that I've now installed League, Cockatrice (MTG), D2, and EQ. Clearly, I'm jonesing. The lack of cannabis over the past 2 months is being felt. I need to channel this energy preferably into building my life instead of a digital character. I need real-life points, not game points.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I want to thank my brother. It was a wonderful experience, and I've learned a lot. I don't want him to feel bad at all (I desperately don't want to hurt him here). He is a far more responsible person than I am in many respects. He can handle this drug better than I can. I'm straight up envious that he gets to play this game and I can't. 

I need to think about whether or not I should continually ask him about it. Do I want to live vicariously through it? That seems safe enough. The temptation and the thought loops must be avoided though. I think I'll ask about it when I don't feel the pull, only as a conversation maker. Ugh. The line drawing on this addiction.

In any case, I need to make my family's happiness my dependence (not actually an addiction by definition).
