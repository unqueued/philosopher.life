!! What would you do if you had all the money in the world?

OMG, Melisandre, I can't believe I'm saying this, but you are becoming as annoying as Samwise. Are you Samwise in disguise? Why should I believe your lies? On a scale of 1-10, how important is second breakfast to you?...Your pupils dilated! Oh nooeeesss!! Fine.

Here's some basic sketched groundwork for your absurd question:

* [[2017.11.04 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
* [[2018.04.04 - Prompted Introspection Log: Fame, Money, etc.]]
* [[2018.11.03 - Prompted Introspection: Wealth Wish]]
* [[2018.11.07 - Prompted Introspection: Rich vs Rich+Famous]]
* [[2018.11.18 - Prompted Introspection: Lottery Wish]]
* [[2018.12.05 - Prompted Introspection: C̶a̶s̶h̶ Trash Money]]

It would probably cease to be money, or I am the material dialectic sublator. I suggest it would be the end of the world.
