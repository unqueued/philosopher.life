title: 2019.01.10 - Be A Good Dad: Giving Tree

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

I feel like the Giving Tree. I'm spending my sanity on my children, and they don't give a shit. They aren't trying at all. They will cost us everything.

3-hour lecture today starting with significant others, empathy, wikis, and a host of considerations. As always, it points to doing our best. I will not be one iota morally responsible more than is conceptually necessary for the invalid identities they choose. The foolish versions of their futures selves are my enemies. If they refuse to cooperate again and again, they are in for it.

We are radically free. You are responsible for your identities to some non-trivial extent. Do not conveniently confabulate and rationalize your way into acting like you aren't responsible when you are. I continually see people selfishly shrink their perceptions of the trees of possibilities. I'm coming for you, pragmatists. =)
