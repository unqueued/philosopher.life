title: 2019.10.17 - Levi: Possible Dinner

I've probably walked past Levi 50 times. I do my nod, chat a bit, and throw can-openers at him. Very slowly developing what may be a friendship.

My wife and I were talking tonight and ran across him smoking on the porch with his phone (classic Levi pose for me) before getting some grub. He handles the homeless fugly cringe troll wanderer just fine, and even went out of his way to compliment me on my onesy with socks+sandals (the man understands style, unlike the folks at Aldis or anywhere else). wait, wait, i get to use this sentence: we, like, vibed, man.

He's possibly found a job as a chemical tester. He doesn't want to go to school again for the possibility of mobility. Sounds like he has an in.

He told me he doesn't think he will live beyond 50. I was shocked. That's my line!

Talked about //The Boys//. Offered to get him whatever he wants. 

He hasn't taken me up on frisbee, but playing board games, yes. He has my number (getting caught with my pants down not having my phone, as usual [never trust that blasted thing]); he makes the call on the date.
