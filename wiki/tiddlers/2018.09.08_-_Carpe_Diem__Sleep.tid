* Woke at 9:30
* Inform the Men!
* Just chilled with wife, noice.
* House with family
* Talked for 3.5 hours with Charlie!
** He took a picture of our last conversation, which occurred in two parts; the first in 2h11m, the second part in 11m2s. He took a screenshot of that. Lol. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* I fell asleep...first on couch, then bed.
** Wife thinks I had a fever. Felt like it.
* Grilled Cheese, Tomato Soup, Salad, Watermelon
* Chatted with folks (I hadn't been on all day)
* Read+Write
