You came to my mind tonight...How are things going?
April 27 2019 8:06 PM
I am late seeing this! Sorry. I don't use my phone often enough. 
Today at 9:19 AM
I'm doing okay. Ups and downs. I've been thinking,read, and writing a lot. I've been homeschooling and trying to make myself useful at the local middle school.
Today at 9:20 AM
The best account of how I'm doing continues to be my wiki: https://philosopher.life/
Today at 9:21 AM
How about you?
Today at 9:21 AM
I heard you might be up for a well-deserved promotion.
Today at 9:21 AM
How's your health?
Today at 9:21 AM
And, what have you been up to with your spare time? What's been fascinating or moving to you?
Today at 9:22 AM
Nothing like working with middle schoolers to relieve stress. Lol
Today at 9:22 AM
rofl, yeah
Today at 9:22 AM
I'm doing ok. Work is killing me but fine other than that.
Today at 9:22 AM
What is spare time? 
Today at 9:22 AM
Haha I have done a little hiking, but my work schedule has been insane. Corporate cut the part-time people back on hours so we are very shorthanded. 
Today at 9:24 AM
I'm sorry to hear it's been insane. It's nice having a job and being productive, but it's also nice having a life too, lol. =/
Today at 9:25 AM
Any shows, movies, or books catching your eye lately?
Today at 9:26 AM
I do not watch much TV. Just a few shows that we buy the season of. I have read about 12 books this month so far, but probably nothing that would interest you. 
Today at 9:30 AM
That's a lot of books. Awesome.
Today at 9:30 AM
Most of them have been about minimalism and Theology.
Today at 9:30 AM
What about you?
Today at 9:30 AM
I read a lot. Lol I have read more books in the last few years than in the last decades. It is amazing how much more I read since I got rid of all my books!
Today at 9:33 AM
I probably have some intersection with those topics, but that's not usually where my book reading goes these days. I've not read many books at all this year so far. https://philosopher.life/#Deep%20Reading
Today at 9:34 AM
I've not been watching many new shows. I've been going through a list of shows with my offspring. We've moved from //King of the Hill// to //Breaking Bad//.
Today at 9:37 AM
We loved Breaking Bad. 
Today at 9:37 AM
Aye. It's a work of art.
Today at 9:38 AM
//Present Over Perfect//, neat. You'll have to let me know if it is worth my time. I have a similar book on the docket: //How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy//
Today at 9:40 AM
Currently reading //Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present// with [[1uxb0x]]. I think it will be a family read. Beautiful book.
Today at 9:40 AM
I adore getting rid of physical books too. [[k0sh3k]] isn't so keen on it, understandably. Between the internet and ILL, I just don't see the point in holding onto many.
Today at 9:41 AM
That sounds interesting as well.
Today at 9:41 AM
I agree. I nearly all of my reading on my Kindle app or on line.
Today at 9:42 AM
How's the family doing? I'm usually so far outside the city limits wandering like a homeless hermit or nomad that I miss out on what's happening.  
Today at 9:45 AM
I think most people hang on to them because of what the books say about them...the picture they present of the reader. I simply do not care at this point. Lol
Today at 9:45 AM
Yeah, some people definitely keep books on bookshelves to merely virtue signal. Agreed.
Today at 9:46 AM
[[R]] is well. She has been really busy with Easter week, a weekend training, a funeral, etc. Hopefully things will get to normal for her.
Today at 9:47 AM
She is always insanely busy.
Today at 9:47 AM
I hope it normalizes for her too.
Today at 9:48 AM
Sounds like the Paradox of Choice. Makes sense to me.
Today at 9:49 AM
I think that she dealing with a lot of emotions with retirement looming about a year away.
Today at 9:49 AM
Aye. It's been a process for her. I can't imagine.
Today at 9:50 AM
How is everyone there?
Today at 9:50 AM
I think that it will be hard for her to lay down her dream, but I am sure that she will find something else meaningful to do
Today at 9:51 AM
Aye, that must be really painful. Lots of logistics to think about too.
Today at 9:52 AM
We are working hard, lol. [[k0sh3k]] is enjoying her job (lucky!). She's been teaching a lot at her church. My offspring grow very fast. They've been keeping wikis for a couple years now too, and it's fascinating to go back through them. http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/ for [[j3d1h]] and http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/ for [[1uxb0x]]. 
Today at 9:54 AM
I'm raising freaks and geeks.
Today at 9:54 AM
Ugh!
Today at 9:55 AM
Haha!
Today at 9:55 AM
That is awful. I'm sorry. One of my neighbors just had to move away from NC because of insurance problems (she hates the insurance she had there).
Today at 9:55 AM
I've been getting more worried about Uncle [[Charlie]]. He's getting a bit harder to reach recently. The past couple times I've talked to him, he has been blue and depressed. He's been feeling down. 
Today at 9:59 AM
[[R]] was saying pretty much the same thing last week.
