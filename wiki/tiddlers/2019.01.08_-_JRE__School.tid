We talked about a guy who fell 12" at work doing something stupid. After the dude was found safe, they seemed to have fun with him about it. That is excellent. 

I talked to my brother about blackwolf. He is gracious about it. I'm doing what I can. I don't think he realized (though I attempted to explain it before) that his gift will not be used until they start doing their work. That got us on the topic of them not trying, after a discussion of magic (he's going to call my son to play). We talked about my children playing rinky-dink games instead of the real things; I've been talking about that for many years.

My brother has encouraged me to put them in school for the competition and relieving me of pressure. He felt this was a stepping stone to becoming someone who pursued their own approval. I appreciate that he's trying to find a solution. I'm grateful for his thoughtfulness, his help, and his ear. It cannot be an easy position for him. He has argued previously that he should have been kept in school instead of homeschooling; this is a major divide for us. I'm listening carefully to his arguments. I do see the utilitarian line of reasoning my brother is trying to provide.
