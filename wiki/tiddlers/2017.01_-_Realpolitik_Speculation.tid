title: 2017.01 - Realpolitik Speculation

//This monthly audit was completed for [[Wiki Audit]]'s project: [[The Remodeling]] of 2018.//

!! Log:

* [[2017.01.23 - Realpolitik Speculation: TPP]]
* [[2017.01.27 - Realpolitik Speculation: RNC's Impeachment of Trump]]
* [[2017.01.30 - Realpolitik Speculation: Early Warning Signs of Fascism]]
* [[2017.01.31 - Realpolitik Speculation: Open Shadow Government]]

!! Audit:

* Why the hell did I stop doing this?
* The TPP article is spectacular. Though, I think I understand Trump's "reasons" more effectively almost two years later (and I should). 
* There are some excellent moves in here that I've seen brought up again and again over the past two years.
* I adore my paranoia and [[Straussian]] approach. I'm proud of this work.
* This is the only other monthly audit, and clearly, documenting a snapshot of my political view was important to me.
