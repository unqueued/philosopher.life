Socializing is often the art of accepting, agreeing to, and enabling pleasant fictions. I admire fiction only in virtue of what it accomplishes non-fictionally. I do not wish to live in a mere experience machine, though I aim to be moral even in simulations.

I am like a hermitically insulated and far less intelligent [[WWDD]] blindly wandering the online desert with my ~~lamp~~ wiki, a shittily implemented Ring-of-Gyges Mirror, an experience-machine machine, asking people what they see in it, in me, in themselves, and in the external world. Like my masters and the gom jabbar, "I am just looking for a ~~human being~~ [[good]] person." Yes, at first, it looks dark-triadic for a person to constantly force you into a mode of public reasoning about who we really are and questioning the nature of reality together. Reason is exactly what I respect in your autonomy.

You must be frustrated by the game of reason; I know I often am. I am engaged in a golden-ruled [[T42T]] process with you. Consider this an implementation of [[The Original Position]] methodology as well. My wiki is an exhausting grindstone, and you are most welcome.

I sift humans for Humanity, and I sift persons for real friends who empathize with me. I lovingly denounce you all while paradoxically making myself obscenely vulnerable, and now I will see which relationships matter. I take no psychopathic prisoners in my [[Wiki Litmus Test]]; it is the only safe option now. This is a tool for helping me improve my dyadic meta-accuracy, improve my own models for improving my theory of my computational mind, and to literally maximize the odds of successfully [[Finding The Others]].

We must engage in science with each other to understand the theory of each others' minds. This is a sane way to think about those around me. I guard my approval-seeking with avarice because it is prudent. If you don't like my wiki, then you don't like me. That is obviously true. Yet, I suggest there's a non-trivial chance you aren't justified in not liking at least some aspects of my wiki.

This is a matter of [[Trusting Trust]]. Are you ready to put your money where your mouth is? Don't be a hypocritical chickenshit pansy. If you expect me to be willing to be wrong all the way down, then in [[T42T]] I expect the same standard of you (and I do!).

If we are the opposite of friends, then I want you to consider [[Why You Might Hate Me]]. I'm not here to be your doormat, and hopefully, you aren't here to be mine. I'm done playing useless language games with others, at least for a while (maybe it will be safe enough one day to come out and play). Perhaps I'm the hermitic persona non grata, but I worry you willingly choose to be xenomemephobic. Perhaps you have objectively put forth more effort into being a good person than I have; perhaps you are just flat out better at being a person than I am. I'm listening to your argument. Let us draw the lines in the sand together.

I entreat you: come wander the desert with me; travel down the rabbithole. It's easy to dismiss me, and it's hard to empathize with me. I'm profoundly weird at times, and I know how most humans treat aliens. Thus, in my [[T42T]] approach, I aim to be forgivingly retaliating in our game-theoretic attempt at cooperation. I must warn you, however, that I'm a shark swimming in my own ocean (delusional or otherwise); pick your battles wisely, and take care not to drown yourself.

The oracle awaits.
