title: 2018.10.01 - Wiki Audit: Le Monthly

The massive audit should be a time to start selecting and building threads for myself!

---

[[2018.09 - TDL]]

The months are absolutely flying by. Jesus. It's insanely fast. I feel like wiki might even be accelerating that process! 

[[2018.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]

This turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated.

[[2018.09 - Wiki Review]]

More depression confirmation.

[[2018.09 - Prompted Introspection]]

An absolute gem to read this month. I hear myself loud and clear in here too. From some angle, this log represents me better than any other, and I'm not sure why.

While it can be useful to know my eating habits with [[Wiki Review]], this seems to have the long-term stories embedded in them nicely. I love it! It's journally.

[[2018.09 - Computer Musings]]

I put out some fires, but overall it has been smooth sailing without much experimentation.

[[2018.09 - Deep Reading]]

I gotta say: I'm disappointed in myself. Still, this isn't garbage.

[[2018.09 - Link Log]]

Feeling a bit like an illiterate here. I only have so much time each day.

[[Tags]] is a thing. Let's get serious about it, eh?

I had a moment where I wanted link autocompletion! I'm going to give it another spin! Installed autocomplete for links in editor. There is a space of laziness between searching and just italicizing that this tool might handle; it doesn't look common, but it wouldn't hurt to keep trying it. It's definitely not nearly as useful as CLI autocompletion, but that's okay!

I have thousands of Tiddlers. This may turn out to be useful, but it could become useless (worried about lag and distraction). So what? I can change [[$:/config/EditorTypeMappings/text/vnd.tiddlywiki]] back if need be.
