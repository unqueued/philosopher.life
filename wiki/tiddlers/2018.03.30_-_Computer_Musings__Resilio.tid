title: 2018.03.30 - Computer Musings: Resilio

Resilio just fucked up amazingly without my intervention. I'm getting `Selected folder is already added to Sync Home Resilio Sync` error even though the folder is not being synced. Daemon reload does nothing. I ended up having to play with different folders and keys to reset whatever the problems was. I got it back up though. I realized that I simply cannot accept using Resilio Sync longer than I must. I do not like how it is proprietary.
