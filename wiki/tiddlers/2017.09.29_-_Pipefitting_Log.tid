I finally have my keyboard on site. We will see if I run into any trouble. I am very much hoping I don't have any trouble, obviously. I need to get used to it. It is a small, compact, slightly modified keyboard.

I believe Chester will be leaving here in the next day or two. Hopefully, I will feel some relief then. I don't know.

Matt said to me today, "remember: if you can't tie a knot, then tie a lot."

Also, I failed to bring out my NCCER books. Having a 3-hour window each day except on Sundays sucks. I have very little time to accomplish what I need to accomplish. I am told there are testing facilities in Charlotte and Nashville. It sucks that they are far away, but that is better than nothing. Maybe the family can take a trip and do something on the weekend while I test.

We went and tightened a ton of bolts up. We got the valve torqued. Chris-M forgets the washers, but we fixed that quickly. We also changed them out two at a time, keeping the general torque. I like that replacement method.

Brandon is buzzing around our area. Meh. 

I'm not sure what we will be doing for the rest of the day. I think I should Kroil up the bolts in our area anyways since, in a few weeks, we will have to take them out.

!! Break!

I helped pull measurements on our pipes for the tie-ins and space to the header. They didn't match. We will need to push the north end about an inch eastwards.

I got the fire blankets all set up top. Gino asked me if we would finally be putting it in today. I said I hoped we would, but that I couldn't make any promises. 

We decided to build internal supports for our top pieces in the trunion. We had a spare pipe, and I found another. I cut them and did some grind work to make them fit. 

Also, I've some random thoughts:

* Always use other's tools so you don't wear out your own
* Be early to get tools from the tool room. Make sure you get what you need before it runs out or you get the shitty stuff.
* Always look busy or hide, unless you are socializing with a superior who can and will cover your ass.
* Dave talked about almost ordering his militia to fire upon BLM folks in Charlottesville. Cray cray.
* Snack on the job, use your breaks for personal time and activities.
* Gino, of Eastman, spends a lot of time flirting with Brittany. Lol.
* Perhaps I should write a guide on "How to Look Busy and Stay out of Trouble."
** These are technically social engineering tricks that aren't direct manipulation, but rather deception through omission at critical moments. Is it immoral? Not if you believe that have the power and keep throwing the first punch. This is Justified War/Self-defense. I'm protecting myself and my freedom here, fighting against systematic abuse, oppression, and labor-extraction.

!! Lunch!

I finished fitting up the two supports inside the trunion. It took some cleaning, and it was difficult working around the scaffold. We really lacked the ladder we needed, despite having searched.

Admittedly, I had very little to do. I kroiled up our entire area. I at least want to make the shutdown as smooth as possible for us. I feel like this isn't a taking the initiative problem exactly, although that may certainly be a factor here. I just don't even know what to take initiative on, and asking often results in just doing what I was already doing but getting the incredulous look and attitude at the same time. Somehow, if they just think you are busy, and the outcomes are the same, not asking has better results in many cases.

I must also admit that I feel like I'm back to my old ways. When I don't see the value in what I'm doing, then I avoid it. I do something else. How bad of a thing is this? As long as I get paid, that is at least decent enough. But, perhaps I don't cultivate the relationships and experience I really need when I engage in this behavior. Yet, I still rose through the ranks at Humana doing this bullshit. But, I don't know if I would have had the success I would want, and I don't know if that same mentality and principle even apply in this context, or contexts like this one, either.

It isn't like I'm avoiding work. I'm just avoiding bullshit. I really enjoy meaningful work. It just isn't lined up nicely for me, and I don't know how to line it up. I don't know how to enmesh my goals with the goals and inferences of all those around me. I think this is at least in part an autistic problem.

I think I also made John angry. He realized I wasn't there to pick up some cords. It wasn't like he didn't have the time to do it (he was complaining all day about not having shit to do). I think it was the fact that I have found a way around it, and he has not. Not everyone gets to do what I do. I will try to stay on his good side though.

I also noticed earlier today that Chris-M did not trust my measurement. When and why does he change his mind? I wish I understood.

I'm doing what I can with what I have. This isn't the best fit for me, I can see. 

!! Break

I don't recall. Snap. I forgot to do this.
