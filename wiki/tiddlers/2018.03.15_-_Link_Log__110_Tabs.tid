110 starting. It blossomed in hundreds. Obviously, I only kept some of the ones I picked out.

*** Outsourcing, crimes by proxy, laundering the exploitation of people through a foreign shell. This is not representation. Thank you, EFF. As usual, you nail it for us.

** https://theconversation.com/how-knowledge-about-different-cultures-is-shaking-the-foundations-of-psychology-92696
*** And, yet, I think the explanation is not as relativized as you might imply. I fear that some memeplexes are truly superior to others. Call me culturist. I am. Each human presents its own culture, and it works inside various culture spheres and sets, pushing and pulling. There are wars, compatibility, and swirl of memes in contexts. It is dialectical.

*** Not always a huge fan. Odd to see his last days actually were closer to the truth of the matter. I think he only started being concerned more directly with the ethical in the latter stages of his life. Wish he'd just say it even clearer; socialism is correct.

* Disconfirm My Bias

*** Well argued. Hate to lose my ammo, but if it's not good, then it's not good.

* Think About It
** https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-018-1436-7
*** Thus, seek to maintain the happiness you have, and don't do so at the cost of feeling like you have no time to enjoy it.

*** Sounds like Civil War, again.
*** I must express my sincerest doubts that it isn't deeply connected with the economy. That's obviously false.
** https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/624049
*** At times, my memory is incredible. Admittedly, when I see what the world is, I can't help but be depressed by it.
** https://www.wikitribune.com/story/2018/03/14/war_&amp;_conflict/russia-changes-the-rules-of-warfare-perfecting-hybrid-war/54989/
*** I would like to add that the US has been engaged in this as well. I agree Russia is to blame, but I think we need to emphasize our own faults as well in this arena. We are hypocrites.
** https://aeon.co/ideas/say-goodbye-to-the-information-age-its-all-about-reputation-now
*** Um, this just looks like the problem Dreyfus talks about in the flattening of meaning. The problem of lacking effective hierarchies, authority, trust, and critical reasoning for separating what is relevant from what is not, is old as fuck. This seems to be a part of the information age, not the next step. This was always the problem in the first place. Reputation also seems to be the wrong word. I am reminded of my Professor Brower's social concepts of epistemology.
*** I would argue that these tools are not too hard to find if you are actually looking for them. How do you convince the person who doesn't know that they do not know? Sometimes, you can't convince people to think outside the cave. It's up to them or no one.
** https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve
*** Peterson has the knack for mixing just the right amount of truth and ambiguity into his work to drive the agenda he has.
*** I am open to the possibility he at least partially aims to be a philosopher.
*** This piece clearly destroys him.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-organization-subpoena-mueller-russia.html
*** Executive privilege.

* Fishy
** https://viceroyresearch.org/
*** Gross. Either shorting the market and/or this is capitalist warfare from Intel et al.

*** I think you're still trying to sweep greed and capitalism under the rug here. It's not worded to get the reader to see the truth in that respect, and that is flawed.
** https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/former-equifax-employee-indicted-insider-trading
*** My hypothesis is that they seek merely a scapegoat. They want to have a trophy to act like they did something about this.
