title: 2019.08.08 - Wiki Review: Get It Together

* [[2019.08.07 - chameleon:]]
** I'm taking forever on 3 letters now, lol. Jesus. Welp, that's how it goes sometimes.
* [[2019.08.07 - Wiki Review: m16 Plz]]
** Yeah, but you have to get your shit together first. It'll come, right?
* [[2019.08.07 - TDL: Cmon]]
** I mean, we talked quite a bit about suicide. I'm not convinced any of them have ever held a gun to the back of their head.
** Test was okay. 
* [[2019.08.07 - Prompted Introspection: Take Advantage]]
** Edited. I'm fairly convinced this is one of the reasons those who read my wiki drop off: they don't want to discuss politics and morality with me or even reason about what I have to say on the topics. I'm happy to have those to stay even in disagreement.
* [[2019.08.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Philosofrisbee]]
** Completed. I'm exhausted today.
* [[2019.08.07 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Millionaires]]
** In no uncertain terms. I scare people away with my claims.
* [[2019.08.07 - JRE: His Voice]]
** It sucks just sitting there LFG though. The server is fairly dead. I'm waiting on my bro. Until then I'll work on a healer build.
* [[2019.08.07 - Afterschool Teaching: Insession]]
** We are so lucky to homeschool. My offspring avoid this bullshit entirely.
*** When I came home today from work, they said they missed me and felt the house was super quiet without having me to speak with them throughout the day.
* [[Poem: Being a Blob]]
** It's how I've been feeling.
