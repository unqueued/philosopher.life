title: 2019.03.04 - Kevin Kovacs: Unfolding

Dear Kevin,

Let me first say, it was a pleasure to watch the letter unfold. I often don't get to experience first-hand some of the processes I am able to provide to [[others]]. This is one of them. I enjoyed it very much, and I will continue to think about it.<<ref "v">>

<<<
I want to lead off by saying I appreciate the steps you took to remove my full name from your wiki. When I wrote I wouldn’t ever ask someone, I meant it and would still gladly communicate with you through these means either way.
<<<

It's not a problem. It's a joy to communicate with you as well!

<<<
I see you’ve also already updated my name to match my Start page. I never really thought of creating a pseudonym, but after you mentioned choosing a name for your wiki, I thought long and hard about it. The full title on that page is meant in jest, but are all references to pieces of media, or people.
<<<

I loved your title. Going madcap is very important, and it made me laugh. Reference is powerful to me in many contexts; I am not sure how to peel it out. I think naming anything, including ourselves, is a gift. 

It's fascinating that you've never thought of creating a pseudonym. I don't know enough about the nature of pseudonyms, but I'm interested. I started using the interwebs in 1994, but it was Astalavista which taught me to be a skiddie; it inspired me to wear my pseudonymous masks like the cool kids.<<ref "f">> Games like Everquest and [[Diablo 2]] forced me to think about my residual self-images, toons, and avatars, my //Uberr Guber// names and surnames, and what it's like to have more than one self-created identity in various contexts (though I make no claim to understanding it well). More personally, I began to identify as some of my monikers. I [[h0p3]] this is the last one for me.<<ref "sp">> I aim to wear my naked face with only splashes of warpaint at this point.

I have grown up hiding myself from people online and offline. As an autist, I spend many spoons to code and pass for normal. It is a crucial moral question: what should be hidden from ourselves and [[others]] in our contexts, and why? Names do so much work, I can't even name all the ways.

If anything shows up for you, I would like to know more about your [[phenomenology]] of naming yourself.

<<<
I’m curious if there are any obvious places that come to mind for you. Off the top of my head I realized Spotify, Instagram, Twitter, WHOIS (through two of my domains, although not my main two) all had ties back here as well as ties to my real name.
<<<

I retract my statement. I'm sure you know more than I do here. There is only so much you can scrub, but it may be worth one more pass for you.

I know it seems weird that I am so insistent on trying to maintain a non-trivial degree of anonymity while shedding so much privacy. My predictions are bleak. We stick our necks out in being differently ourselves. Some heads get chopped off justifiably and others unjustifiably. Authentic (whatever this means) participation with so much risk is rare. Given how I see other humans engage each other, by and large, deviation from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable.<<ref "i">> Unfortunately, there's no defusing that bomb without skin in the game.

<<<
> If you are serious about securing your pseudonymity, you will need to sever that link across the board. If you are super cereal about it, you’ll need to start from scratch on a new HL.

I agree. I’ve started to do this. Admittedly, very slowly, and in the end, the tie will still probably exist elsewhere on the web. I want to take steps to get //close//, but I’m not ''super cereal'' to the point where I want to start over, despite only recently starting. I’m okay with a) the people who already know knowing
<<<

Rock on. I can appreciate trying to be practical about it. My paranoia swims far sometimes, and I have to reel it in.

<<<
Although for all I know you or someone else could be working to steal my identity as we speak. I guess there are probably other people out there that know my real name too of which I’m not aware of through the brief time it was up on both yours and Jack’s Wikis, along with being on Kickscondor
<<<

Identity theft, at least as it is commonly understood, is not my primary concern.<<ref "ip">> Bouncing surface trolls is good, but I am also concerned with unjustified algorithmic coercion and alienation both online and off. Your honesty makes you incredibly vulnerable, imho. You aren't going to stop an advanced persistent threat in many contexts, but your work here also makes it so you aren't low-hanging fruit. This is a hard problem to understand, let alone answer.

<<<
 and b) if someone is determined to find out who is behind it and digs around. My main concern is potential future employers digging around with my name and discovering it. There’s already enough shit out there about me as it is.
<<<

This is one important problem. Capitalism is quite a beast. You are likely a more optimistic man than I am. Forgive me, once again, and humor a dystopic vision. Tell me it isn't possible, feasible, or plausible. I am surprised you talk with this desert madman at all.<<ref "d">>

The thought police are already here; they are just retarded piglets for now. Thiel's Palantir and China's half-feinted surveillance powers are only simple prototypes which haven't been integrated and perfected in our world just yet. Data remains largely unmined, but perhaps once we have significantly complex enough ML (or even GAI) as a scapegoat (oh noes, the blackbox algorithm made me do it...surely no one is responsible), government agencies and private institutions which seek illegal and even unconstitutional information access (or decisions based upon such factors) will turn to unscrupulous data mercenaries by shells and proxies.<<ref "t">> Black markets will become whiter through the laundering of bureaucracy. Moral corruption is a given, but it will become increasingly effective. Surveillance capitalism enforced by paramilitarized police forces will be used to efficiently herd us into silenced commodification. With the death of democracy, those in power will more freely be able to treat even US citizens as we have treated much of the rest of the world.<<ref "c">>

I am sure, even now, you are careful about how you use your work machines and work VPNs. That problem is going to grow further into our personal lives. It already has in my lifetime.

Pretend I'm a dark-triadic CEO 20-30 years from now. You bet your ass I'm paying oracles to tell me if I have disloyal wageslaves, uprisings to quell, whistleblowers, or even more benign forms of disutility to my bottomline. 

Oh, that one is depressed, that one is a flightrisk, that one might tarnish our image, that one has too many STIs, that one reached the thresholds to likely activate their genetic predisposition for this ailment, that one isn't publically toe-ing the company's political lines effectively enough, that one smiles too weirdly in the bathroom, that one doesn't have a fast enough response time to company calls before midnight, that one browses websites we don't approve of from home, etc.; well, let's find any possible reason to fire them ("Evil Corp's MOTHER computer's TPS reports say your ~~Good Boy Points~~ Employee Rating is too low, and thus you are fired effective immediately. We'll mail you your things after inspecting them; here's your escort. Yeah, about this, I'm sorry, bud."). 

I would sweep my employees constantly. Redflags would merit deeper investigations, and I could pay contractors to do the dirty work: hey, the liability won't be mine. If every employer does it, if it becomes normalized, if that is what the market dictates, then surely we're all going to put up with it. Boxing without [[The Golden Rule]] gloves gives me the competitive advantage, hence I'm going to squeeze your identities for every penny they are worth.

Your trails on the web will eventually be tracked by digital wolves of those who have power.<<ref "pw">> Those who can access the silos of "Do No Evil" companies, who already make profitable concession after concession, will have the competitive advantages. People make money nudging, defining, and controlling your identity, and that's only going to get worse. Perhaps we must build identities now which will survive then. Many people already keep two sets of books, one for surveillance capitalism, and the other tucked away to actually be themselves. Don't cross the streams.

Write those words of your life's story you're willing to die for.

<<<
I think. I feel like my reasoning and behavior is still pretty inconsistent. It’s a fluid thought process for me and it’s why I’ve appreciated both yours and kicks thoughts and inputs.
<<<

Completely fair point. I am, unfortunately, inconsistent when I'd prefer not to be. I am grateful to have the chance to be fluid enough to change though. I will continue to think about what you've said to me.

<<<
In the end, I think at that level of semi-anonymity, I can be as honest as I want or as I would be if I were completely anonymous and be comfortable. That’s what matters for me.
<<<

Cool. It's not easy to make these decisions. I'm glad you take them seriously. People should be scared; we have to wake up and fight. I am convinced everything is at stake. You can't achieve perfect anonymity either; I think pursuing reasonably costed semi-anonymity is about all we can feasibly do (that varies per person's context). 

The entire process is uncomfortable for me. This wiki is about two and half years old, but I only started actively leaking it about a year ago (though it has been publicly available since 2016). [[Find The Others]] has been a joyously costly {[[axiom]]}.

<<<
>    I strongly admire both your willingness to accept non-trivial responsibility for the consequences of how you manage your own identity and how you respect my free speech. I’m impressed that you don’t ask us to pay a price that you aren’t or weren’t willing to pay yourself. I think you’re showing integrity

Just leaving this here for myself. I greatly appreciate these kind words. This essentially boils down how I ''try'' to //live// my life. It’s //usually// pretty easy for most people to overlook it, which is fine, I honestly don’t seek out attention...this weblog probably says otherwise, and maybe I’m just completely full of contradictions...and a lot of the time look to avoid attention given my social anxiety and awkwardness, but when people do notice these attributes it’s a good feeling.
<<<

I love that you pick out the line that matters most to me. That is a damn good sign, sir. Looking at it again, I am convinced it is [[Golden Rule]]-oriented. There are those who deny we have any obligation to engage in approval seeking whatsoever, especially since it can be maladaptive to our hedonia and eudaimonia. It's also clear that empathy is a form of idealized approval seeking. It's not an easy balance to strike, and I cannot say I do it well. 

I know that feeling of being inconsistent with myself. Sometimes it's part of the conditions for having the gift of being able to change ourselves in [[Self-Dialectic]], and sometimes it's just a plain mistake. I cannot say I succeed in being coherent, but I'm trying.

It's hard to see you as awkward from over here. The anxiety and sensitivity, I can see. Sometimes you are like a laser to me in your writing. Sometimes you leave me thinking in your //~micro~//. I'm enjoying watching your changes and correspondence too. It's lovely.

<<<
>    I like to engage in Music Exploration, but I think I bat far below what you do, lol. IIRC, none of the songs made it into Music: Library

I hadn’t come across your Music: Library before. It’s a wonderful collection and an idea I will eventually replicate myself. 
<<<

High praise, thank you. 

<<<
However, in it you write:

>    You can’t simply pick the whole album or discography; force yourself to narrow it down.

And I completely understand the goal of this collection, and each individual should treat their music collection however they want, but in my mind, and hopefully for the foreseeable future, music is to be consumed through albums.
<<<

It is possible you have not seen my ~~diatribe~~ opinions in the //About// subsections of [[Music]] and [[Art]]. I don't know enough about the ethics of aesthetics; I can neither agree nor disagree to what may be a polite disclaimer there. I aim to appreciate why listening to full albums provides the fitting experience. 

<<<
If there’s a piece of music I want to listen to, ninety percent of the time I am going to listen to the entire album. Without //Feel// and //The Ballad of El Goodo//, //In The Street// and //Thirteen// lose just a little bit. There are definitely some one hit wonders out there, but can you really listen to //Santeria// without wanting to listen to //What I Got// or //Caress Me Down// or //Garden Grove//???
<<<

I went to listen again. I see nothing lost. I must be blind! I'm trying not to listen to the words though. You inspired me to write: [[Hymns of h0p3]]. 

<<<
The way I look at it, a song is to an album, the way a chapter is to a book.
<<<

We will have to disagree here. Music is emotionally stimulating, but it does not transport me into narratives like a book. Music adds layers to stories, but it's almost never a story (let alone a valuable, high [[S2NR]] one) in itself to me. Insofar as there is a story which matters to me, I'm adding the story to the music myself. I'm constructing it to a more significant degree than in the case of the book (though I realize our [[phenomenology]] itself is radically constructive in mind-bending ways).

While I will readily admit listening to music has a mental cost which doesn't allow me to maximize my ability to think and feel in theory, I've found it does help me in practice (could be mere hedonic motivation or even placebo). I prefer to use music to augment reality. Sometimes, it holds and feeds me in the flowstate zone. Sometimes, it helps me maintain myself in imaginary worlds and mutter to myself. Othertimes, it helps me unfocus as I dance, mosh, perform my sick karate chops, play air guitars, and walk; I let my unconscious do some jogging without me holding the reins, and then I can refocus with a sense of renewed vigor and notion of where I'm going. Music unleashes the mystical animal in me.

<<<
Now, I use playlists as cliff notes to find new artists, and create playlists myself, but these are always limited to create an album-like experience, which the sections in your Music: Library create a cohesive experience as well, but it seems to be alphabetical. I believe in the art of album/playlist ordering. In my playlist, they are meticulously ordered to evoke a feeling ''for myself''. I //hope// others notice, but in the end, I don’t think anyone will.
<<<

I'm still learning how to curate. I prepare for a possible day in which I can engage is non-trivial ML with it. 

The lists are in alphabetical order because I intend no lexical ordering or sequentially-derived meaning. I listen to my music in music-player-random on purpose. I see it as my job to pick the signal out of the noise. Perhaps it will one day be in service to the ordering art you achieve. I'm not able to effectively see or do it yet.

<<<
Back to my book metaphor, maybe there’s a passage from a book you like to return to often, but to really get that full experience, you are going to read cover to cover.

I could go on for hours about music, as I bet you could given some of your similar tastes.
<<<

The book metaphor doesn't click with me, but I agree music is an emotional experience. Beyond attempting to behold [[The Beautiful]], music tends to be primarily instrumentally (:P) valuable to me. It's a pleasure and a tool. Insofar as you are wired to maximize your pleasure and productivity through listening to albums all the way through, then it does seem fitting. I'm sifting for [[Salient]] [[Gems]] and engaging in science with them. I tend to only hear an entire album through exploration.

<<<
>    This might be a dumb thought: I would like to know how (if at all) one should compare meditation practices to the kind of introspection of self-modeling. They seem extremely different to me.

I think I completely disagree. But I also could be a little dim when you say //introspection of self-modeling//, although I think I get what you are sayin. One is internal introspection, one is external introspection. And I will be the first to say I might being //doing// ''meditation'' completely wrong. But in my mind, it’s very much a practice of observing your mental and emotional states, noticing it, coming to a better understanding of it, and being okay with it.
<<<

That might be quite right. I'm woefully underexperienced here. I appreciate your insight. 

If I don't choose to focus myself, my mind races, loops, and rabbitholes. One of my goals in meditation is to learn to tame that out-of-control force. I want to have the opportunity to have a still and quiet mind at will (which is not how I otherwise live my life). I suppose there is a kind of [[Stoicism-fu]] to assenting to what is immutably outside our control. I ain't so good at that.

My goal is not to engage in cognition too thoroughly, but only weakly in my meditation. I'm trying to celebrate it as a gutturally-oriented process (which requires some cognition). I'm trying to turn parts of myself off to hear the other parts. My wiki is hypertelic, voracious, embracing-the-grind, and filled with heavy (for me) lifting. I'm looking for a place not to be doing heavy mental lifting. I am regularly asked by my loved ones to stop thinking, to take a break, etc. I was thinking meditation, with training, might be the outlet. I'm not there yet though. So far, I'm just enjoying it, but I'm not sure it does anything more.

<<<
Neither meditation or self-modeling are a means to fix anything. But they both have the ability to uncover things through their ''process'', which could lead to other changes.
<<<

We may wrestle here. I am sorry. Changes for the sake of what? Toward what [[end]]? I am open to process theology here, to the emergences of dialectics, etc. If there is nothing to fix, then why do it? What is the purpose of meditation and self-modeling as far as you can see?

<<<
In a tangential way, it’s how I approach self-modeling with this weblog.

Let me know if I completely missed what you meant though. I find this topic very interesting.
<<<

Me too! I'm still ~~meditating~~ thinking about it. Maybe this is something I'll understand better years from now. I still feel like a noob in my own wiki all too often. Lawd knows, it may take a lifetime for me to learn how to med up.<<ref "eq">>

<<<
>    Indeed, there is too much to consume. You do seem to have a desire to sift for what matters through the endless flood. What are you hunting for and why?

I have a somewhat similar question for you as well. But to answer, I don’t know if I’m necessarily ''hunting'' for anything. I love stories and I love learning. A well written sentence, even if I can’t write one myself, is a beautiful thing. And seeing someone create something they love is even better. News, tv, movies, books, comics, music, art, anything. If it’s crazy, if it’s unique, if it’s beautiful, I want it in my life. It inspires me to be better, to be more creative, to be more unique.
<<<

You will have to forgive me for, like, being just the worst kind of pedantic weasel. It sounds like you are hunting to me. Learn for the sake of what? I think you are at least hunting [[Beauty]].

While I'm interested in qualia, I'm afraid I don't place too much emphasis on the intrinsic value of uniqueness. There may be a rabbithole here. I leave it to you to ponder and question.

In any case, I wish everyone loved stories and learning as much as you do! 

<<<
kind of trippy how I can refer to something I wrote later in the letter, in an earlier paragraph. Maybe that’s just me.
<<<

That is so trippy! I have that vertigo all the time in [[hyperconversation]]s. It's so non-linear. I am underprepared for it, lol. It's beautiful and interesting though. It's something I probably don't study enough either.

<<<
Below I’ll touch on my career in an ideal world, which really relates to the idea of wanting to be a life long //learner// and desiring ''change'' probably more than the average person.
<<<

`/high-5`

Change for the sake of what?

<<<
This brings me to the some of the similar questions I had for you.

*    How do you consume everything you do?
**        You have pretty deep link logs, and you seemed pretty quick to pick up my last letter to you.
<<<

Poorly, in frustration, in manic states, in depression, in curiosity, in awe, while inebriated, while I'm bored, with various [[dok]] of focus and comprehension. I wish I could force myself to read more effectively than I do, especially books. I'm hoping this is something that comes with age. Maybe I'll get there? Probably not. That's okay, I'm just going to do my best.

As for my timing, my consistency is wave-like. I'll pop-up all-the-modelers to see what's happening on a whim. It's usually daily. Maybe I should be more disciplined in my approach. I find very few stacks stick with me though. 

<<<
*    Do you have certain places you visit regularly?
<<<

I'm embarrassingly bad at this. I'm straight up addicted to the web. You'd think I would know what the hell I'm doing at this point, but I don't. [[Link Log: The Stack]] and [[Reddit Theory & Practice]] should go a long way to answering your question. Curating maximum [[S2NR]] ain't easy. Until radically more P2P-based filtering becomes a reality (if it ever does `/wish-upon-the-stars`), I'm forced to use aggregators. HN and Reddit are my go to places.

<<<
*    What sources/types of sources meet your criteria to be in the mix regularly?
<<<

That is a damn [[good]] question. I suggest I may read a lot more meaning out of that question than you may have intended. What do I need to think about, and why? [[Root]]  holds my best answers. {[[About]]} has held up fairly well, but {[[Principles]]} is in absolute shambles. Those two are meant to dictate everything, including my sources. I aim to answer some ridiculously hard questions as best I can.

Does it gutcheck feel valuable (virtue is bias [[irwartfrr]])? Can I cognitively and accountably demonstrate it is valuable? I'm trying to train my gut to see what is [[salient]], to find the [[Gems]] and needles in the stacks and heaps. You are free to say I'm doing a terrible job, rofl! What do I have, what do I need? I am surprised all the time, thankfully. Where is the source of real [[hope]], especially in my context?

<<<
*    Do you rely on individuals to come across pieces to read?
<<<

Insofar as they are necessary to my aggregation and curation stacks, yes. Insofar as they enable me to efficiently and safely discover or leap into the unknown, yes. Society, in large part, can be described in virtue of networks of reliance upon trusting [[others]]. I must rely upon others to pick out what is [[salient]] in almost all (maybe all) contexts to various [[dok]]. I require experts to help crystalize model-[[gems]] of things beyond my understanding and give me advice. I require effective signaling infrastructures for finding those who merit my trust (and in defining merit). Directly, I rely upon individuals to have relationships with them. Indirectly, many individuals pop up again and again for me in my filter-bubbles. Finally, there are cult-leaders like Bill Gates and [[Scott Alexander|http://slatestarcodex.com/]] who merit my attention; I must read my enemies.

<<<
*    Are you as obsessed as I when it comes to visiting others Wikis?
**        I find myself visiting five different wikis multiple times a day.
<<<

I usually do not touch my family's wikis until Sunday. I am extremely vocal and obsessive about them throughout the week and especially family time.

My browser sends a notification to my DE whenever [[Sphygmus]] posts (basically like a minutely update check). I read hers as soon as I know it exists. [[The Matrix]] is my favorite movie, and every time [[Sphygmus]] and [[kickscondor]] post, I feel as excited as the crew of The Nebuchadnezzar rushing to watching Neo & Morpheus in the training simulator. 

Every other wiki varies. 

<<<
>    Your work sounds fun and stressful. Why’d you make the transition?

An opportunity came up where I’ve worked for awhile now and I felt like I couldn’t pass it up. I’ve always been a technologically minded person, but never took the time to learn to code or anything like that. I’m young enough to where I feel like I can make the full transition and move back if it doesn’t work out. This gave me an opportunity to dip my toes in and start to learn. In my ideal world, I’d learn and do a completely new job every three years. I’m also someone who prizes loyalty, and the fact where I work now has pretty much allowed me to change, evolve, and adapt to a wide variety of roles, makes me want to stay here as long as possible. I am worried, though, they will get tired of my incessant need for change. I’m not sure what I’d do at that point.
<<<

Ah, I can appreciate that quite a bit. Most people our age will have something like that 3-year interval wish granted. I hope you wisely acquire all the novelty and change you crave.

<<<
>    I have another question: how and where do you think machine learning is going to intersect with the kind of work you are doing on HL? What do you feel about it?

Man.. this feels deep. I feel like there are a million different ways to take this question though. Machine learning in respect to pulling useful information and trends for myself? Or in respect to, if it’s eventually filled up with years of logs, what a machine or someone utilizing a machine could potentially learn about me or even mimic me and my personality given the written text of my brain here. Or from a dumber machine perspective of having this entirely populated by a machine based on what I’m doing, consuming, or even thinking.
<<<

Yes. All of those. Maybe even an fMRI machine that maps you reading your own words aloud to your physical states. Maybe having the chance to speak with yourself. Maybe having a tool which helps you curate art, links, etc. Maybe a superintelligent version of you can teach you with radical speed and [[salience]] while maintaining your autonomy. Maybe even something which is your proxy in various social contexts. Let me say, I'm probably not much of a transhumanist, but I am convinced ML and GAI will eat the world, including us, in time.

Sit on it for me, please! I am still unable to see what matters well enough.

<<<
I’m very curious about how you use your wiki in a number of different respects. I’ve found reading it and digging around to be very useful in how I can both utilize this site for myself and how to think about different aspects of my life and maybe, most importantly, honesty. Both with myself and the real world. With that being said I’m hoping to ask a few more pointed questions. If you prefer to let your wiki speak for itself or just don’t have the time to go through each in a full manner I completely get it.
<<<

That is high praise. Thank you. 

<<<
First of all, how do you use it in a daily basis.
<<<

I may not be understanding the question. I suppose it should be obvious to me, but it isn't. [[Recent]] and {[[Focus]]} give the best answers I can give. It is possible that {[[Help]]} will be of use to you.

<<<
There are two parts I’m really curious about, when it comes to new entries and then utilizing the information that’s there.
<<<

This continues to evolve hard and fast for me. I have no satisfactory answer (though I try to answer); I'm standing in the roaring whirlwind. You will need to read the wiki to see this one for yourself. There is too much for me to distill. I feel like my wiki is filled with remembrance and breadcrumbs. Ultimately, I can only see a semblance of what it was to me.

<<<
First, do you have it constantly open at your work station to add notes throughout the day, and 
<<<

Yes. I use [[i3]] (it has transformed how I use the rest of my computer with my wiki), with a workspace (virtual desktop) devoted to it. I use [[Wiki: Scripts]] and [[Wiki: Chromium Setup]], including [[Auto Text Expander]] and [[Text Blaze]], on top of the Bob-TW server in my [[RGM]]. I usually have multiple tabs open with different storyrivers. 

From work, I use [[monster-14]] with a nice collapsible keyboard, and I use a VPN to access the Bob server running on [[monster-10]].

I work on my wiki a fuckton, although it might not always look like it. Like an obsessive madman, I funnel my life into my wiki as best I can (which isn't to say I'm effective).

<<<
second, when utilizing past entries are you searching for pieces of information, or do you ever go through your own rabbit hole as a sort of time capsule.
<<<

I search and rabbithole often. I also aim to systematically refactor the wiki in ticktock iterations. [[The Remodeling]] is part of the [[Wiki Audit]]. I am still not able to see what I'm doing well enough to answer you to my satisfaction. I perform monthly and yearly audits of the [[Monthly Auditables]]. I am also engaged in reliving, rethinking, [[deconstructing, and reconstructing|Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]] my wiki inside and out. Part of this work is on hold until I have [[Firmcoding]] set and hopefully the forthcoming Commander tool in hand. 

<<<
Im also curious where you get your generic prompts and antipleonasm //gems// from. I like the idea of this practice and I’d like to try to tackle something similar but am not sure where to really start.
<<<

[[Generic Prompts]] for [[Prompted Introspection]] were ripped from a few searches. There is also a difference between [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]], which comes from wherever I can find it, and [[Antipleonasm Analysis]], which I'm still developing even the notion of. Originally, the analysis was meant to comb through the catholicon, but I've been using it wrestle with either philosophers or arguments I consider [[salient]] to my context at the time. Time will tell what it becomes. Even [[Prompted Introspection]] has evolved (and the wiki in virtue of it too).

I will not be able to give effective advice here. I just don't know enough. I can only tell you that doing it every day will grow your understanding; the habit matters. The starting place isn't so bad: go find questions, quotes, and claims, and respond to them.

Imho, both of those logs do a great job of pulling my identity onto the wiki. I find the other [[Core Daily Requirement]]s to be about taking my pulse, maintenance, and doing the basics (which is not the claim I'm doing a good job). They do help me interpret time periods and find patterns too. I find thinking about my [[Prompted Introspection]]s to be far more exciting and interesting to me in most cases though.

<<<
Lastly, for now, do you openly share your wiki with people you know and meet in real life? That seems to be the case based on parts I’ve read.
<<<

I definitely want to know the same about you! 

I do not openly share it with every person I meet. There are some I do not trust, but I think most simply wouldn't have any interest at all. It's not easy to make sense of this monolith, and I don't want to waste the time of the people around me (they already have to put up with me). When people get to know me enough to the point they can clearly signal they are interested in how I spend my time (which is fairly uncommon), I do. Family and close friends know. I consider this an ultra-high bandwidth tool for communicating with those I [[love]]. It has served many purposes.

<<<
I apologize for the length, hopefully it’s not a drag for you to get through.
<<<

No worries! I love depth, breadth, density, and emergence. Real conversations can be hard to come by in my experience. I think it's a good thing that we can be verbose! It doesn't happen enough. Society loses something by not conversing in 1-on-1 longform writing. I hate to say it, but I didn't write many letters until my wiki (that's actually how it started). It's not even that my muscles have atrophied; they never existed in the first place. Well, here's [[hoping]] I'll be able to change that.
