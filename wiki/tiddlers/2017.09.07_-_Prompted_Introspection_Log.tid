!! What do you think of the experience/knowledge distinction your co-workers make?

I think experience is a special kind of knowledge. I think knowledge, by definition, is codifiable. So, Tolkien, Samwise Gamgee, and the rest of you fuckers can suck it. You missed the Socratic boat. 

Go ahead and claim it isn't feasible, practical, or even possible for you to learn outside of the field. That is not the same as a theoretical, universal claim.
