title: 2018.10.06 - Charlie: The Usual

Charlie and I talked for a couple hours about physics, philosophy, politics, computer science, lockpicking, religion, quaternions, his desperate need for a computer...the usual suspects. He has a special, inexhaustible mind. If I live to be 60, I hope to be a badass hermit like my Uncle Charlie.
