title: 2019.05.10 - TDL: Clean

* No date, but I hope we can walk. My wife is going to be exhausted.
* House needs cleaning, as always.
* I'd like to still do exercises with the kids here. I want it to be a habit.
** But, it is a free day for them. Ugh. I hate monopolizing their time.
* Feel like I'm not making enough progress in my reading and writing.
** Meh. You have a lifetime to read and write. Take it one day at a time.
* I don't think we need to go shopping.
** Your wife decides.
