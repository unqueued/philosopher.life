Luxuriously long conversation! =)

Phone problems again, but my bro hacked his way through it ;P. Bluetooth on his own desktop made it so he could pace. That is what we both have done since children: we walk while we talk. The tradition has lasted forever with us. I can hardly sit and talk anymore: though I can write.

My bro's THC vape has been outstanding. He can't smoke either. His jaw hurts when he does, and I'm just too sensitive all around for it (gonna make me puke).

My brother talked about work. Crazy cold, new apprentices, keeps getting called weird, he's attempting to normalize being open humans, and he ran 30 feet of pipe with 5 people. He sounds like the perfect jman to me. I love the way he defends those hierarchically below him and the truth. I don't see how he keeps track of everything, but he does. Oh, Carl is out of United! Woot! =)

Rebecca wrote a cover letter for a grant writing position. She's the 'supervisor' without teeth to a fool. Her own boss gives her free reign, but is apathetic to goal-orientation entirely. Politics go very poorly there. She'll be taking a huge pay cut, but she believes it will make her happier. She is a competent woman. I can still barely describe her too, and that is fascinating.

We talked about names and labels. My brother hates when people dismissively define people as "millennial." It was a good dialectic.

I forget what else we talked about. Arg! I hate my memory. Age + depression = I can't remember fucking shit to save my life. I feel like I'm losing my mind, and the awareness of it is anxiety inducing.

Had to go bang. He understood. `/laughing-salute`
