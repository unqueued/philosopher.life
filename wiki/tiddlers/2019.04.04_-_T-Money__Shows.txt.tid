Grinding along. Watching //Inside No. 9// with the fam. My kids got what I had, but not so harshly. My daughter is still not feeling amazing.

THU 9:31 PM
I could have tapered off slowly.
THU 9:31 PM
But I wanted to feel the pain. So I dumped everything in the front yard and ran over it with the lawnmower the following day.
THU 9:32 PM
But they sell it at the local 24hr truck stop. So it's just symbolic.....
THU 9:32 PM
Lol. Well, symbols still mean a lot to me.
THU 9:33 PM
I like for the story I get to tell.
THU 9:34 PM
"so I dumped nearly a kilo of that garbage on my yard and ran over it with my zero turn, like a badass. (leave out the crying part.)" lol
