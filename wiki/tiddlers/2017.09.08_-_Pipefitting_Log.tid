title: 2017.09.08 - Pipefitting Log

Arrived at 6:30. We now do sign in at the van. Lucas didn't show up again. I'm guessing he is gone.

We are working on the trunion today. I helped Chris-M get the rigging into place. We rolled a pipe. We don't have an electric source for grinding the rust off our old grinds. We also only have steel chokers, which isn't a good idea. I do not understand why, although I would guess that they would be more likely to slip off this very short piece of large pipe.

!! Break!

We waited.

!! Lunch!

We waited.

!! Break!

We took it down. =(

I suited up to help put in a riser 60 feet in the air. I helped my boss by climbing a ladder to grab a nylon choker off another pipe to do this. We were stopped by safety for climbing the scaffold without a retractable (good). We didn't make it in time, and someone (Greg) forgot to put the Victaulic gasket on before the fitup. The fitup was very difficult to do because of the clusterfuck (the previous one) domino effect. We are still paying for it. 

My boss was pissed (as were several other bosses). He was rude to me. I'm pretty much done with it. I'll take the money.
