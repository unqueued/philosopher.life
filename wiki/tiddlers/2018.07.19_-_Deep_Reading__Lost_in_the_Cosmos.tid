title: 2018.07.19 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos

The book has become electrifyingly good. Someone is speaking my language. I might not agree, but that is irrelevant.

<<<
In a sign, the signified and the signified are interpenetrated so that the signified becomes, in a sense, transformed by the signified.
<<<

Sounds like dialectical and sublation to me, homie. I do not understand this interpenetration, but I must grant the possibility.

<<<
The fateful flaw of human semiotics is this: that of all the objects in the entire Cosmos, which the sign-=user can apprehend through the conjoining of signified and signified (word uttered and thing beheld), there is one which forever escpaes his comprehension--and that is the sign-user himself.

Semiotically, the self is literally unspeakable to itself...

The self of the sign-user can never be grasped [by its self], because, once the self locates itself at the dead center of its world, there is no signified to which a signifier can be joined to make a sign...

You are not a sign in your world. unlike the other signifiers in your world which form more or less stable units with the perceived world-things they signify, the signifier of yourself, is mobile, freed up, and operating on a sliding semiotic scale...
<<<

Beautifully said! I have seen many versions of this argument. It's a powerful problem for us.

"shadow-life of the earth-self," the "catastrophe of the self," etc.
