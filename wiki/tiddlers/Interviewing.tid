title: Interviewing

//You have to sell yourself, even though salesmanship is fundamentally psychopathic. Yes, this is manipulation, which is gross; it's not who you want to be. As a matter of Just War Theory and your duties to your family, you are not only morally permitted but obligated to engage in this behavior. Unleash your PvP skills, avoid their traps, and lay your own. Interviewing is a social arms race of choreographed deception. You need to practice this rhetorical social dance. Preparation is the only advantage you have, so script the encounter in order to give yourself space to interpret without having to fully improvise. Prepare a gameplan that you can comfortably tailor on the fly in each context. You must present a face of consenting to letting them exploit you while actually ceding as little ground as possible (*just the tip).//

* __Can you work under pressure?__
** "//Absolutely.//"
** Give an example!

* __What was the toughest decision you ever had to make?__
** "//In life, my toughest decision has been choosing not to pursue academic philosophy. I'm good at it, and I enjoy it. But, academia doesn't pay well, acquiring a tenure-track position is like winning a small lottery, and I didn't appreciate the publish or perish model. I had to make the practical decision to leave a vocation I loved.//"

** Prepare an answer that either demonstrates a quality most important to the particular job or a quality always in demand for any job.

* __What changes would you make if you came on board?__

** "//My management approach is to hire the best people I can find, train them thoroughly and well, get them excited and proud to be part of our team, and then work with them to achieve our goals together. If you do all of that right, especially hiring the right people, I've found you don't have to fire very often. Firing is a last resort. But when it's got to be done, it's got to be done, and the faster and cleaner, the better. A poor employee can wreak terrible damage in undermining the morale of an entire team of good people.//"
** "//I don't have any experience firing anyone. But, I have had to fail many students in classes. Sometimes this would set a student back an entire year of work. I do not do so lightly, and I make sure I've excellent reasons and evidence for it.//"

* __What would you do if a fellow executive on your own corporate level wasn't pulling his/her weight…and this was hurting your department?__
** "//I would speak to them directly, explain the issue, and work together to solve the problem. If they don't change their mind, then I keep trying again and again, involving wider and wider circles of people until we can solve the problem.//"

* __May I contact your present employer for a reference?__
** "//My present employer is not aware of my job search and, for obvious reasons; I'd prefer to keep it that way. I'd be most appreciative if we kept our discussion confidential right now. Of course, when we both agree the time is right, then by all means you should contact them. I'm very proud of my record there.//"

* __Give me an example of your X. (where X is being creative, skilled, analytical, etc.)__

** "//I have many kinds of goals. Would you like me to discuss my career, personal develop, family, health, or community service goals?//"

* __What do you for when you hire people?__
** "//I try to determine if the candidate is capable of doing the work, if they are motivated to do it, and if they are good fit for our team.//"

* __Sell me this X (where is a stapler, pencil. etc)__
*# "//Well, a good salesman must know both his product and his prospect before he sells anything. If I were selling this, I'd first get to know everything I could about it, all its features and benefits. Then, if my goal were to sell it you, I would do some research on how you might use a fine stapler like this. The best way to do that is by asking some questions. May I ask you a few questions?//"
*# "//Just out of curiosity, if you didn't already have a stapler like this, why would you want one? And in addition to that? Any other reason? Anything else?//"
*# "//And would you want such a stapler to be reliable?...Hold a good supply of staples?//"
*#* Ask more questions that point to the features this stapler has.
*# Make your presentation citing all the features and benefits of this stapler and why it's exactly what the interviewer just told you he's looking for.
*# Close: "//Just out of curiosity, what would you consider a reasonable price for a quality stapler like this…a stapler you could have right now and would//"
*#* Repeat all the problems the stapler would solve for him, and if he says he'll buy it, tell him: "//Ok, we've got a deal.//"
*# If your interviewer tests you by fighting every step of the way, denying that he even wants such an item, don't fight him. Take the product away from him by saying: "//Mr. Prospect, I'm delighted you've told me right upfront that there's no way you'd ever want this stapler. As you well know, the first rule of the most productive salespeople in any field is to meet the needs of people who really need and want our products, and it just wastes everyone's time if we try to force it on those who don't. And I certainly wouldn't want to waste your time. But we sell many items. Is there any product on this desk you would very much like to own…just one item?//." Then repeat the above process.

* __How much money do you want?__
*# Never bring up salary. Let the interviewer do it first. 
*# If your interviewer raises the salary question too early, postpone it: "//Money is important to me, but is not my main concern. Opportunity and growth are far more important. What I'd rather do, if you don't mind, is explore if I'm right for the position, and then talk about money. Would that be okay?//"
*# Get the employer talking about what he's willing to pay before you reveal what you're willing to accept: "//I'm sure the company has already established a salary range for this position. Could you tell me what that is?//"
*# Know beforehand what you'd accept. Look for 20-25% pay increase, and more if you're underpaid.
*# Never lie about what you currently make

* __How do you define success…and how do you measure up to your own definition?__
** "//The best definition I've come across is that success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal. I would consider myself both successful and fortunate. I've had the chance to work in academia, build fascinating computing systems, and work with my hands to construct practical physical systems.//"

* __If you won $10 million lottery, would you still work?__
** "//After I floated down from cloud nine, I would still have the need to achieve something to and give meaning to my life through being productive. Money is necessary but not sufficient for happiness; I need to work to be fulfilled.//"

* __Tell me something negative you've heard about our company.__
** "//I've not heard anything negative about the company. What are your thoughts on the company?//"

* __On a scale of one to ten, rate me as an interviewer.__
** "//You have been thorough, methodical, and tough-minded, the very qualities needed to conduct a good interview.//"

*** "//Yes. It's not problem.//"

** __How many hours a week do you normally work?__
*** "//I always worked hard and put in long hours. It goes with the territory. In a sense, it's hard to keep track of the hours because my work is a labor of love, and even when I'm home shaving or commuting, I'm thinking about my work. I love problem solving.//"



* Weaknesses, Failures, Flaws, Regrets, & Redflags
** Give no ammo or reason to say no. They should only remember positive things about you.

** __What are your greatest weaknesses?__
*** Assure the interviewer that while nobody is perfect, you can think of nothing that would stand in the way of your performing in this position with excellence.

** __Tell me about something you did - or failed to do - that you now feel a little ashamed of.__
*** "//While I am not perfect, I try not harbor regrets. At the end of each day, I meditate and reflect on the day. I can't change the past; instead, I focus on what I can do in the future.//"

** __Tell me about a situation when your work was criticized.__
*** a.k.a. __What have you learned from your previous mistakes?__
*** "//I've been fortunate enough not to make any major mistakes. However, nobody is perfect, including me. I see mistakes as opportunities to improve upon.//" 
*** "//As an instructor, my performance was regularly evaluated by my students and other faculty. I receive high marks in my evaluations. One professor, however, offered a gentle criticism of my work. He told me that I was being too charitable and neutral to authors we read and discussed in my class. He said I needed to present my opinions more forcefully. He knew I had strong opinions because I had been his student before, and he's read my work. I took his criticism as a useful license, so presented my opinions while still being fair.//"
*** "//As a top pipefitter helper, journeyman preferred working with me because I did a good job anticipating their needs. I was critique my bevel technique on a 12" stainless pipe. I asked him how he wanted it done, and I cleaned it up. By the end of the day, my journeyman and my welder said my beautiful bevels looked like I had been doing it for a decade.//"

** __What about X? (Where X is a "Fatal Flaw" in your resume)__

** __Could you have done better in your last job?__
*** "//I suppose with the benefit of hindsight you can always find things to do better, of course, but off the top of my head, I can't think of anything of major consequence.//"
*** If pressed, misdirect by describing a situation that didn't suffer because of you but rather from external conditions beyond your control.

** __Looking back on your last position, have you done your best work?__
*** "//I'm always trying to do my best, and the best of my career is right now. I'm always climbing the mountain of success.//"

** __Where could you use some improvement?__
*** Identify a cutting-edge branch of your profession (one that's not essential to your employer's needs), and talk about seeking to improve in that.

** __What makes you angry?__
*** "//I'm an even-tempered and positive person by nature. I only get angry when someone doesn't consistently pull their own wait or exhibits a pattern of deceptive behavior. I've found talking with people to work wonders, especially since it helps us understand each other's point of view.//"

** __What do you worry about?__
*** "//I wouldn't call it worry, but I am a strongly goal-oriented person. So I keep turning over in my mind anything that seems to be keeping me from achieving those goals, until I find a solution. That's part of my tenacity, I suppose.//"

** __Why should I hire you from the outside when I could promote someone from within?__
*** "// "In general, I think it's a good policy to hire from within, but if you are looking outside, then it maybe you're not completely comfortable choosing someone from inside. You want want the strongest candidate you can find, and I fit your needs best...//"

** __Where do you see yourself five years from now?__
*** "//I'm interested in making a long-term commitment to my next position. In terms of my future career path, I'm confident that if I do my work with excellence, opportunities will inevitably open up for me. It's always been that way in my career, and I'm confident I'll have similar opportunities here.//"

** __What are your career options right now?__
*** Do not reveal desperation. Demonstrate you are a desired commodity and you're exploring several options.

** __Why have you been out of work so long?__
*** You've prolonged your job search by choice.
*** "//I made a conscious decision not to jump on the first opportunities to come along. More importantly, I've spent my time homeschooling my children. We've achieved excellent results, and now I feel comfortable moving back into the workforce.//"
*** Other hacks for gaps in your resume:

**** Family tragedy made you move home for six months and care for your brother before he died.

*** List only books you are ready to discuss.
*** Prefer to list books which are related to the industry.

!! Responses to Inappropriate Behaviors/Tactics:

!! Interview Questions I Still Felt Unprepared For:

*  Think back to a decision you recently made that you knew would have significant impact on the organization, people, or the future. What was your decision, and what did it impact? How effective was it? What factors did you consider in determining its effectiveness?
