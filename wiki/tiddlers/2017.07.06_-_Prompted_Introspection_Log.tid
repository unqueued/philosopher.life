!! Do you save old greeting cards and letters? Throw them away?

I throw them away. I consider them vain, lacking depth and genuine empathy. I believe they are used as a means of virtue signaling. Ain't nobody got time for that. It's a way of staying in touch for some, but I think that's about as weak as a FB relationship. I find it lacks authenticity all too often. I think they are lies and rhetoric. 

I can't recall receiving many letters that ultimately mattered to me for future reading in any direct emotional or rational way (except to myself). Of course, I sift through my correspondence regularly. I must mine my information. I do not "save" them as decorations or for scrapbooking purposes like others though. This is the crux of the issue, I take it. Hence, I still take myself to be throwing away most correspondence. I do not preserve them. My letters with [[R]] may be the only exception on this wiki. 

Generally, when I have saved them, I look back at have disdain for it. I realize it was a tradition without merit. My wife's letters are an exception.
