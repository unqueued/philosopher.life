title: 2019.05.23 - The Matrix: Critical Theory

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233019004_The_Matrix_and_Critical_Theory's_Desertion_of_the_Real

I come back to this with a [[gem]]: [[power]]. Let's do this shit.

I swear to goddess, I don't want to see the word //discursive// one more time. I agree OOO is antihumanist, and I agree Kantian and Heideggerian subjects won't necessarily be human; persons or Dasein are different. 

This article doesn't mention it, but it's interesting to me how the last two films come out back to back with little time in between them. 

<<<
 knowing what is real and what is not is the condition of possibility for his freedom.
<<<

This line is about political autonomy (as is virtualized here), imho, and I agree it is nearly eliminated altogether through The Matrix. I deny this removes his moral agency, although it radically filters, alters, mitigates, and enillusions it. We are still agents in simulations; in fact, I don't think we can be an agent if we don't find yourself in some kind of moral medium which is simulated/computed. 

Fascinatingly, I still agree to this sentence even out of its original context! That's just what philosophy is doing. Without the ability to recognize what is outside us, to know the truth, to delve into metaphysics even just a bit as the [[fff]], we couldn't even have moral agency either.

There are many conditions for "distinguishing between ideological mystification and real relations of [political] power."

<<<
epistemological questions always beg the ontological: true or false to what or whom?
<<<

Yikes. There's a better way to acquire the subjectivity and contextualism you seek without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And, if you doubt that, I will ask you: is that sentence objectively true? I know that's not the point of this article, but you have to say that carefully. Cmon!

<<<
 Although there is no permanent, essential, or universally experienced reality, the category of reality is necessary to political judgment even as it finds intelligibility, conscious meaning, and strategic import in discourse. 
<<<

That sentence might be gibberish. I agree no two people can experience the same thing all the way down, but I agree there is an object, and it's relationship to all subjects is definable for [[The Infinite]]. Otherwise, why should anyone care about political judgment on such groundless grounds? I'm worried I'm still dealing with someone who thinks they've the truth but denies Truth exists. `/sigh`. I should be charitable: they are trying to take down postmodernism, and so surely this is not gibberish. They don't deny access, they just mean to speak of our [[fff]] access. Ugh. Still not sure.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the base-superstructure concept, especially not the mechanistic aspect, as long as we preserve freewill in the conception. It looks like emergence to me and a spiralic relationship between memes and material.

<<<
if we and our knowledge of ourselves are constituted in the discourses around us, on what basis can we act in our own interests? 
<<<

So, deny it! We are only mostly that. I can see the struggle with compatibilism here. There's only one way out, and it's ugly as fuck: libertarian freewill. That is a hard fucking bullet to bite, and obviously, it can't be antihumanist (or anti-person).

Althusser’s denial of human agency seems uncertain even on compatibilist grounds though. It tends to be correct; it's probably the case, but you'll never have the certainty of absolute death of the subject.

<<<
In a Foucauldian world, as in The Matrix, discourses unfold out of themselves as their own agent, transcending the possibility of instrumental intervention in the production of reality by anyone other than a godlike savior. The natural conclusion of the conflation of discourse and reality today is mysticism.
<<<

Ofc, I must be a madman. What a conveniently stoic perspective that asshat takes up. I deny it is possible for the autonomous agent to be irreducibly accounted for in physics. That's how far I agree to an "outside." Foucault's historical framework begs the question against metaphysics and hence Objectivity. 

Also, emergent agents don't seem to have the freewill I take individuals to have. I am highly reductive here.

<<<
 contemporary capitalism has taken complex transnational form, an instrumental politics founded on the real relationship of class
is no longer tenable.
<<<

God damnit. Fine, fine, fine. yes. If by "tenable" you mean "likely" beyond a fucking miracle, yeah, I agree. My [[hope]] is razor thin. I agree Capitalism is nearly invulnerable, but I do not deny our freewill. Success requires a ridiculous percentage of the world making highly improbable choices. 

<<<
Foucault, suspicious of Stalinism and therefore (albeit unnecessarily) of any desire to overcome the capitalist system in the whole argues that intellectuals and activists should give up a broader systematic struggle in favor of localized efforts in the ‘‘fine meshes of power.’’
<<<

KYS. [[gfwiwcgws]], for the sake of what, to what [[end]]? You deny the [[end]], and thus logically, you deny the means. That is just a fancy and convenient way to stop giving a shit right there. Relativize down the local contexts all you want, but if you don't think it systematically adds up, you still have anti-telic relativism. This is why political philosophers need to engage in metaphysics and metaethics. Jesus Christ.

I can appreciate the claims here. It's not like their understanding of how to mimic agency doesn't influence actual agency. I believe there is something out the cave though. 

<<<
 their actions cannot and are not allowed to threaten the reality of machine power, a metaphor for the futility of struggle against a global capitalism posited as centerless, flexible, and invulnerable at the macroscopic level.
<<<

Do you think the Wachowski's converted? I cannot tell you how many Christians I know who resolve the problem by just saying it's up to God, and they have zero interest in fighting it (or even oppose such a claim, since this is clearly the mystical will of God).

<<<
the illusory prospect of a perfectly unitary and homogeneous collective that will render pointless the moment of politics.
<<<

But, do you think we can make progress toward such a thing? Clearly, there is an all-else-being-equal ideal, right? Assuming a great deal: I'm also open to this moment being made by proxy through my own AI representative, and I don't know how conscious one has to be (though clearly it is preferred). That is weird move against the lived experience claim, of course, and I think there would still be significant knowledge and experience requirements on me for my own representation to connect those dots on my behalf. 

---

But, what is the difference between pre-given class identity and pre-given shared interest? I think identity comes in [[dok]] here, and interest is an identity (even if a shallow and incomplete one in many respects). 

Uh...The article barely did any philosophy. This was much closer to sociology. Meh. Critical Theory.
