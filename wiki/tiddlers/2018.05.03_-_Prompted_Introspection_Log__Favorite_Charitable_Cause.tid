title: 2018.05.03 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Charitable Cause

!! What's your favorite charitable cause and why?

Define charitable cause? Does it have to be a registered non-profit or NGO? Does it even need to have a standard governing body or corporate structure? Interestingly, I don't think it's a "cause" but rather an "end" I'm pursuing. As usual, I see philosophy and socialism. I don't think any particular body of people do it as systematically correctly as I'd like. That's okay. I feel like its a rhizomatic mesh of people working on different aspects of it.
