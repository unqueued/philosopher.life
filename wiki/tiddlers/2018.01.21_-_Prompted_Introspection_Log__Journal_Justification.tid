!! Why do you journal?

Lady Melisandre, I can only [[h0p3]]<<ref "2019.03.23">> to answer your question. I have two answer attempts for you. The first is {[[About]]}. You might boil this down to: I want to be eudaimonic. Of course, what is entailed in that is not simple, to the point that I can't even define what that looks like. Of course, I explain that in my anchor page (what I just linked to you).

The second attempt is this: if I fully knew the "why" of my activity, I probably wouldn't even need to do it (or it would be much briefer, direct, etc.). That's part of the metanarrative problem itself. I'm trying to define for myself the game I want to play. I feel very much like I'm playing one of those highly esoteric clicker/idler games where you must make up the meaning and reasons to play it for yourself. If I already knew the answer, then I wouldn't be searching for it.

Both attempts might just be the same problem, of course.
