title: Analytical Psychology: Its Theory & Practice

My female donor clearly had some Hegelian and Jungian influences in her dialectics with her children. As INTJs, we are both convinced there's something there.

I wish I had that excuse: English isn't my first language.

New case is new theory. Extreme.

He's a hell of a speaker. Watch that disclaimer micdrop.

Why does he think we have no relation to the unconscious? Surely he isn't being careful. He quotes Kant in the same paragraph (GOOD!). You are then open for me to fire on all cylinders. No, he clearly means to connect them. Agreed to representations of some kind.

Terrifying. What am I? I do not know. I am trying to tell the story in this wiki. I aim to identify myself as that [[4DID]] in coherent unification, but also regulated by the external principle of normativity: [[The Right]]. Not all selves are equal. Finding the correct relationship between the Ego in any given timeslice and the Ego's Tunnel is what I take to be a fundamental problem. The dialectics between the conscious and non-conscious parts of us seem to be necessary for telling that story well.

Talks of progress and his inability to predict the future (so wise, my interlocutor), and that is why I think we can say some valuable things about the unconscious. I'm going to have to fill in the gaps for him, on his behalf, as best I can.

A fascinating move not to anthropomorphize the unconscious! 

It is always "as if." Ah, he might bite the full Kantian enterprise bullet. That vortex is irreversibly enchanted? God damnit. Fine. Let's do it. I'm going to take him to reality town if I can.

Mmm...I think the phenomenology of my ray of intentionality actually has a gradient to it in many contexts. He's not quite right, but he goes in a great direction.

The reason we can never have an image of totality is that a computer cannot simulate anything greater than itself: you will pay a reduction or time price. Only [[The Infinite]] can simulate itself. He is correct that it's too narrow, but I don't think for the reason I explained. It's clear he's engaged in phenomenology here. It's well done too! He's so obviously a philosopher trying to do science. 

<<<
Consciousness is very much the product of perception and orientation in the //external// world.
<<<

I'm going to hold you to it, nomad. Let's see if you and I agree on what those words mean.

Oh, I am relieved to see that he sees consciousness as an emergence from the unconscious. It's perfectly fucking obvious. I will grant that the only missing ingredient will be [[The Good]] in terms of perception. We shall see.

Without using the words, he's talking about the ready-to-hand and present-at-hand modes! Yay! Brother, speak to me. Hilariously, I am convinced we think with our gut...biome! It is weird to call it part of the physiological process which gives rise to my mind, but it seems to have far more impact than I initially assumed. They are honorary neurons to me.

<<<
Nothing can be conscious without an ego to which it refers.
<<<

Keep 'em coming. I might be in love.

That said, I'm looking too closely. There are already too many inconsistencies. He can't mean exactly what he's saying all the way down.

His line about philosophers and thinking is hilarious. I think he's trying to give a common sense definition. He's dramatic, hyperblic, and often absurd. I'm not always so good at separating out when to read him literally and when not to.

As a Platonist, I'm okay with a mysticism necessary to talk about the conditions for the possibility of perception at all. This line about how intuition counts as knowledge of what we don't know seems to be about the being of becoming of knowledge. It's an ancient problem. I don't have an answer. I'm okay with a bit of mysticism and faith at this level. There is no escaping it.

Much of his discussion of the difference between feeling and intuition here could just be expressed as the non-cognitivism of virtue theory. Some people have habituated their gut instincts better than others, and that includes the gut instinct when to trust their gut instincts (into [[infinigress]] if we were infinite). This is the part of non-cognitivism which I must concede both in terms of my phenomenological experience and my understanding of what it even means to be engaged in [[self-dialectic]] from the outside.

We are still in territory I have strong opinions on. Unfortunately, I am forced to put words into the mouth of this mystic to charitably interpret him as a [[Straussian]]. He is not careful enough (especially since he has no idea how to talk about perfection), and now I must complete the puzzle for him.

Let me say, the opposing functions are dialectical, and they are profoundly an example of a virtue-theoretic-spectrum (with a golden mean). The X and Y axis necessary to place the Ego in a given time slice is there. I ADORE it. Ah, and finally the ego rises with the Z-axis, and the spiraling dialectic emerges to create The Ego Tunnel itself. Maybe he didn't choose the functions correctly, but he is clearly onto something. He even names time so nicely. 

Throw in some quaternions and quantum physics, and we have all the magic we need, right? lol. 

I hear Saint Aristotle screaming out of this man. Jumping up and down screaming at me. Yes, Saint Aristotle, I hear you. You are going to bust my eardrum. 

I am in favor of working with 4 layers in Atropos too. It just feels right to me. I often think it is a dialectic of two objects themselves in dialectic. Ah, and it brings me to an actual dream and game I have played with myself since I was a young child. The fractal [[infinigress]] of the dialectics nested inside each other. It is almost a compulsion in me.

It's pleasant to be able to talk to a mystic as a mystic. We can speak in icons. 

I am not sure I can see sensor vs. intuitor just by looking at their eyes. Sometimes it is obvious, but not always. We are going to have a disagree about the relationships of opposites possibly. I am doing my best to see it his way. Part of the issue is that I think someone can choose to become someone who shoots for the other side of the spectrum to complete themselves in that context. Is he going to handle that correctly?

He continues to hammer "the principle of one function excludes the other." They are only meaningful in virtue of the other as you already said. I agree they cannot be identical. You must look for the emergence of them both together. They are "done at the same time." They are the negative space for each other in the oscillation, in the jagged wave that arises from the flatness. You cannot define your place on side of the spectrum without having defined your place on the other side of that limit. They are binary opposites which compute the algorithm together. 

There is the kind of wrestling which is purely competitive, [[T4T]], and there is the kind which both sides benefit from in defeating the iterated prisoner's dilemmas (alongside those relationships which can have pure synergy). I aim to show respect in my wrestling, to demonstrate what it's like to deconstruct the [[other]] for the sake of constructing together. Unifying ourselves requires a strategy of cooperation. 

The discussion of inferior functions is a discussion of slave dialectics.

I love the redpilled moves in here. He is obviously a fantastic observer of human nature, custom, and history. I'm pretty sure he would fully appreciate how much of a basketcase I am.

I appreciate how freewill is dialectical. I can see he is already going to be reasoning about dominant functions are [[SO]] about [[FO]] functions. I am in position to agree with him about the lack of freewill from the inferior function. Compatibilists may openly accept it though. It is here that my mysticism may be shining through. He clearly is already prepared for my point of view with a fresh ad hominem. ;P

<<<
The ego is only a bit of consciousness which floats upon the ocean of the dark things.
<<<

Holy shit. That could of came straight out of {[[About]]}! It is fucking wild to see another human talk about this. Coincidence? Kinda. Obviously, I have been shaped by his memeplex. I had no idea he ever said this. It's not precisely as I think though (which is normal), and I'm sure the sea metaphors are bottomless (probably just a coincidence).

I am extremely unhappy with the Neurathian ship because it is both the Ship of Theseus and the problem of internalism wrapped up into a metaphor. I think of myself as the entire ship, a hyperboject I cannot see or understand all at once (and I cannot see inside the metal, etc.). I think that which is not my identity is anything which isn't the ship.

I don't have as large a fascination with the non-conscious aspects of personhood as he does, imho. It is still miraculous to me, but I don't think it is absurdly mystical in the way he appears to. I'm lucky enough to have access to a more cognitivist approach to the computational theory of mind.

I see no reason to agree that our future personalities are categorically currently hiding in our dark nonconsious.

!! Lecture 2

Myth and archetypes blow. The dream work is ridiculous except: he denies the tabula rasa and appears to support some kind of innate grammar. The poverty of the stimulus is here. Of course, this innate knowledge or remembrace is ancient, and I don't care for Plato's articulation too much beyond what is evolutionarily necessary for the eidetic structures of our empirical phenomenology.

Jung is profoundly mistaken in his view of how our personalities having been always present in the darkness before becoming revealed to us. He doesn't have enough contingency. I'm not pleased with his approach to seeking wholeness through our dreams either. I say that know that dreams clearly say something profound about the nature of consciousness, but I cannot say the stories themselves have anything beyond a general measurement for us to consider. I'm far more of a fan of [[The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self]]. I think the collective unconsciousness portion is likely insane. I'm willing to consider emergence, but this appears to be some mystical binding narrative force deep within our unconsciousness.

I cannot speak to this surface and layering just yet. It may be right. I appreciate ordered approaches, but I'm looking for more feedback looping than it demonstrates. This is an image about the intensity of willpower.

I all in favor of using metaphor, pattern recognition, tropes, and reduction as narrative tools for making progress. He seems to step far beyond that claim though. 

There's this sleight of hand where the real, authentic you at the core of you unconscious isn't you at all but instead some mystical incarnation of pattern/trope. 

I see a noble savage line of reasoning here too. It's too romantic.

I appreciate the inferior, ordered, dialectical functionalist approach t his work. I like that he aims to find patterns. There are a lot of mistakes here in though. Of course, he could ad hominem me as lacking the virtuous perception. Sorry: I don't see it.

3 methods for sussing out the dark sphere of man:

# Word association
# Dream analysis
# Active imagination

These do sound like randomized story telling devices for enabling us to confabulate any internalist opinion into whatever normative fact we might hope for. I'm all for exploration though! Know what it is though.

!! Lecture 3

I can work with the claim that consciousness lacks the unity we would hope. There is an illusion we work to dispel. Unification is profoundly part of autonomy, but our responsibility and power over ourselves is limited.

NOPE. I'm done. I will continue to thinking about it from afar.
