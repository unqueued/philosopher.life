title: 2019.10.21 - Computer Musings: Port Is OPEN

Uh, I don't know what changed, but the port is now open. The tech said he did try something, but now is the first time I've seen anything at all (it's been fucking weeks). I wonder if anyone else complained? Why now?

I don't trust this is going to last though, sadly. Still, it's curious. It might not matter in a few months anyway. =)

My daughter should still build the tool anyway. It's good practice.
