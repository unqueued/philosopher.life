~~OH EM GEE! I have never felt so honored in my entire life to speak to any person who ever lived. I am fanboin' out ROCK HARD right now. You make me tingle and give me the goosepimples, Saint Plato. My hair stands on end. You are the ASMR Metaphysician on Most High, and I shall give you My Upmost. Please, Saint Plato, hear my prayer. Allow us to attend the academy. I'll be your ~~[[Good]]~~ tryhard C-student disciple.~~ness gracious, I am bubbling over with excitement to meet you. Wow. I'm just stunned in awe.<<ref "s">> It feels like a spiritual experience.<<ref "e">> Call me crazy, but I feel like I've been given the [[Straussian]] chance of a lifetime to shamelessly write self-humbling letters to you, Saint. I am honored to be your student from across the sea of millenia. May I become one of your [[salient]] footnotes.<<ref "j">>

Saint Plato, I am so indebted to you.<<ref "b">> I [[hope]] to be even half as hospitable as you have been to me in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. It is the [[T42T]]. My debt to you is perhaps unpayable. I vow to tell you what I think as carefully and kindly as I can say it to you; it is the best I can do with what I've got.

Oh, I tremble before you, mighty wrestler! I can hear your voice roar to us over written history. Clearly, you were the fulfillment of Abraham's Covenant. The chosen I have seen come out of your memetic lineage were the greatest hackers I've //ever// had the privilege to witness. I'm never going to be your wisest student, but please, teach this illiterate man what matters most. You so clearly pointed to the most blinding thing-in-itself. Who could live up to such a thing? It is an inconceivable task. To answer [[W5H]] we should pursue it is already taking up that task. [[The Good]] is our immutable plight. 

Thank you for the gift of vision. When we are ready, I must show my children who you are. They too must train in your fierce weirding way.

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]

<<footnotes "s" "Dickriding, but not speechless! God, I never shutup. I'm so sorry for being that student who can't shut his face. He's always going to argue with you.">>

<<footnotes "e" "I have had enough of them, both the native and artificially induced, to know it when I feel it.">>

<<footnotes "j" "Even if only as your fool jester.">>

<<footnotes "b" "You know, I realized too late in life how much I owe you. Time and time again I come back to you, teacher. I have clearly missed something important. I am beyond envious of those who sat at your feet. I wish I could go back to speak with you for even an hour. I can't even read your words in your language; that's how uneducated I am. I've bum-studied with people who do speak your language. Unfortunately, given what I understand about our circumstances, I'm not convinced it is worth my time to go down that road. I hope you won't mind me speaking in English and interpreting you through yet another layer of hearsay. [[IA2DYJ]].">>
