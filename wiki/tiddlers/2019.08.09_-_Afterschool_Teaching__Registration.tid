title: 2019.08.09 - Afterschool Teaching: Registration

Delp was happy to see me. I was later told he was just trying to get us some hours. He offered to hand me all the test questions to the Accutrane. Might as well take him up on it. He suggested I just pull up all the videos in a browser to mute. Already on top of it, sir. =)

I went to see Matt during insession. He was not pleased to see me. Lol. Well, I hope he figures it out.

I organized papers, filled out some spreadsheets, etc. He left, and I played secretary answering the phone (mostly for the staff). Registration was simple and we were filled up. Everyone else is waitlisted.

I talked with some parents. I did what I could to connect.

Matt told Whitney to take the older kids. She was sure she'd only get 7th and 8th, but I showed her that 80% of the students are in 5th and 6th (and generally the younger are the most likely to stay with consistency). She wants the assistant principal to help me. We'll see how it works out. Obviously, I am being handed the more difficult students again this year (which is fine; I'm far more experienced). 

The Elder Janitor showed. I went out to meet and walk with him to catch up. We talked about the floors, his goal of saying "no" next year, and the underground pipes he's worried about. I talked with him and his wife as they ate lunch.

I spent more time speaking with office staff than I have for half a year. I have no institutional knowledge, so I was pretty useless to the dozens of callers I handled.
