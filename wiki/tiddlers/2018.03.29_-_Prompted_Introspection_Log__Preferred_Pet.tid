title: 2018.03.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Preferred Pet

!! What kind of pet would you most like to have?monkey, snake, goat?why?

I like having pets insofar as they are useful tools for training empathy in myself and my children. We spend a great deal of money to have cats, one of my wife's drugs of choice, and I'm ultimately glad we do. I like cats, as you know.

I did not care for our tarantula, Itsy. But, it is preferrable to a wide variety of other exotic options.

I don't want smelly, high-upkeep, or annoying animals. Crucially, I refuse to own an animal which is legit dangerous, especially to those who cannot defend themselves. Dogtards will tell you a story about conditioning, but this is only half true (I've met far too many wild dogs to believe their story). 

In a way, my preference is for creatures which are truly alien to me. 

Partially setting aside upkeep concerns, I want jellyfish and a bobbit-worm (separate tanks). I also want algae eaters and anything which makes upkeep simpler (which is a real pain in the ass, from my reading). There are lots of cool jellyfish, and I know I want psychedelic lighting and at least one immortal jellyfish. 

I'd want absolutely transparent polymer balls (of various sizes) to form the groundwork for the bobbit-worm inside a (reasonably) sound and vibration insulated 1-way mirror tank (to prevent the bobbit-worm from realizing I was observing), and very minimal lighting which would show-off the bobbit-worm suspended in transparent "groundwork." Perhaps I would need to keep fish in the tank as well to feed it consistently. I would also like a deep learned camera feed to capture the movements and especially the hunting behaviors of the bobbit-worm.

If I had my own house and large plot of land, I'd like to raise goats and insects for feeding us. They wouldn't exactly be pets.
