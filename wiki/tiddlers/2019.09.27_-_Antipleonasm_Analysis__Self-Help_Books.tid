!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I despise the kind of book which tells you how to live, how to make yourself happy! Philosophers have no good news for you at this level! I believe the first duty of philosophy is making you understand what deep shit you are in!

Roflmao. It hurts so much. Thank you. I'm too drunk to care about being technical here. It annoys me to no end to hear what the average person thinks philosophy is about. Fine, fine, fine, yes, I agree to Aristotle's basic teleological argument, and thus justified eudaimonia is what I'm aiming for. The "how to live" and "make yourself happy" [[irwartfrr]] is philosophy, but it's not the [[Redpilled Stoicism]], vampiric, egoistic, moral relativizing, pay any cost to be happy bullshit I see from charlatans sweet talking you. 

Aint no saving grace or gospel here. Therapy will only get you so far in the desert. To think it's generally pleasurable, chillaxed, or there are shortcuts is a lie. Capitalist, egoistic sophistry, KYS. Still, we have our moments. Reflecting upon one's [[awe]] (often part of this space) might show us that we're in deep shit, but I still have [[hope]].
