title: 2017.12.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Living Reversed Life

!! What if you lived your life in reverse (being born old, etc.)?

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to make that a meaningful question. Let us say that I lived my life first in the normal sense, and only then lived it in reverse. This is more than just moving the time-slice marker backward on the 4-D creature since that is not me "living it in reverse." I need to actually experience it, according to your question. And, if I'm really not going to be able to change my timeline, then I'm relegated to mere observance in the absolute sense, and not really "living it" in any normal sense either.

Okay, Samwise, I'm going only going to say this once (because you are a terrible hobbit-being): that's actually an interesting question. It doesn't make any sense when you think about it (even if you attempted to relegate yourself to being maximally an observer with zero input into your behaviors), but it is still somehow interesting. I'm not sure what it means to be an observer in that sense (even though I don't think Dasein has any freewill, given how our conscious experience is an illusion that emerges from subconscious processes).

I'm a weirdo (you know that), and I've seen //It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia// so many times, that one time I watched the entire series backward. I feel like I learn things about it looking at it backward and forwards. I've read particular papers that way as well. It requires me to really think about the overall structure of the thing. 

Look, it would be hard for me to interpret just re-experiencing my life forwards, not even in reverse, given what I know and feel now. The reverse would be insane. It would be quite an observance, no doubt. I have no way to talk about or conceive of it. I'm sorry. Samwise, your question is interesting, even if you clearly have no idea what it means.
