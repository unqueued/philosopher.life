title: Positive Nihilism

Accepting the plight of applied [[Postmodernism]] and magically being constructive with it. This seems like a metamodern move. It is a nihilism-tolerant variant of the existentialist revolt against nihilism. Sounds like a contradiction, but guess what? It's fucking nihilism, so that's okay.

Positive Nihilism is:

* the joy we find in nihilism.
* the constructive destruction of false interpretations of the world.
* a philosophical position that strips religion, as well as society, as a foundation for moral and existential values.
** Hence, at least for the West, nihilism is the state of metaphysics after the collapse of the Judeo-Christian memetic hold over Western society.
* a transitory state, not the end goal. 
** It is transitory in the sense that since there are no inherent, universal, unconditional goals, if you don't want nihilism, then you are free to accept something else.
** If nothing actually matters, if everything is absurd, then you don't contradict yourself when you choose to think anything matters, since being wrong in that context doesn't matter.
* an opportunity to reevaluate or transvaluate all values. 
** It's up to us whether or not we see it as philosophical suicide.
* a chance to love our fate and build a life wherein one would wish to live forever.
** The only meanings in life are the ones you give it.
** Since nothing intrinsincally valuable emerges from nihilism, the ultimate freedom of nihilism is not objectively a burden.
* a memetic Ring of Gyges transporting us into a meaningless experience machine; it is the ultimate test of who we really are.

Feel free to be moral. Yes, you are the arbiter of morality for yourself. You are autonomous (even if we aren't free). We give ourselves laws, but we aren't morally responsible. That's what a computer does. It gives itself laws to follow (that's what each line in a program does in the CPU). You are just a computer. Hence: nihilism. But, positive nihilism obviously shows us that we are free to continue computing as moral beings, even if morality isn't objective. Feel free to be moral. Be as moral as you think you can be. Why not? What's stopping you? Nothing. You're a nihilist. Be moral because you really want to, even when you don't have to. Can you come up with a better reason than "want to"? Can you come up with anymore noble than that shit? You are wearing [[The Ring of h0p3]].

[[RPIN]]: Neo-Kantians are clearly in a kind of cult/religion; you virtue signal in Kantianism to make sure everyone agrees with you or should agree with you. This distorts the pursuit of truth though. It only buys you socially accepted beliefs about what is true.

There is no reason a Kantian can't just take up Utilitarianism as their fundamental decision procedure. Perhaps the utility principle is the center of the CI. Why not? What justifies Utility? Everything underneath it that supports deontology.  Oh yeah, this is all up to me anyways. I'm just going to do my best and enjoy it. It's the stoic thing to do. Look at me, all practical in my theorizing.<<ref "1">>

Aphorisms, Humor, Rhetoric, Fallacies, and Arguments:

* What is the "manliest" way to kill yourself? By struggling through existence until you die from natural causes after a long life.
* Big deal, Jesus, so your dad created you to suffer and die, that's what all the rest of us are doing here too.
* Stand in the ashes of a trillion dead souls and ask the ghosts if honor matters.
* Every human life is something beautiful that is ultimately meaningless.
* Just because God is dead doesn't mean you should be.
* Just because "should" has no objective meaning doesn't mean you shouldn't give it meaning.
* Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, and everybody's going to die.
* Nihilist's To-do-list: distract self until death. 
* I expect nothing, and I'm still let down.
* Even if your life is pointless, you still want your life to be meaningful, so go enjoy doing that. 
* What do you call someone who isn't a nihilist? A Denihilist (deny-alist)
* Why did the nihilist cross the road? It doesn't matter.
* Fuck it, it's just life.
* Hey Nihilist, what's the matter? Nothing.
* Embrace the void.
* Entropy tends to increase in a closed system. The closed system dies. This too shall pass.
* What is dead may never die.
* It's a joke. This is all a joke. Once you realize what a joke everything is, being a comedian is the only thing that makes sense.
* Every person dies alone.
* Nothing matters and we're all equally worthless.
* Nothing really mattress.
* Without nihilism, I would have nothing to live for.
* Without our meaningless hope, nihilism devalues, depresses, derealizes, depersonalizes, dissocates, and disintegrates us. 
* If Surd is true, then deductively everything follows. 
* Life is a sexually transmitted disease and the mortality rate is one hundred percent.
