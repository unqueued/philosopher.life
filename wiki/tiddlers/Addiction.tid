title: Addiction

Addiction desperately needs a definition. It is a weasel word which smuggles moral content into a claim which should be explicated instead of hidden in the nebulous generalized word itself. Careful analysis shows deep cracks in history of how we use that word. Embedded in it is a series of biological, metaphysical, and metathic assumptions which few if any have justified in a systematic way. Let me, again, voice my skepticism about the use of this word which I inevitably use poorly (as well as everyone else, imho).

Addiction, roughly, it is a consistent, impulsive behavior which we judge to have suboptimal enough utility calculations that we collectively call it irrational.

That said, I think we can improve in our conceptual and scientific understand of this phenomenon. 

Let us go with the sanitized and yet loaded Wikipedia definition:

<<<
Addiction is a medical condition characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences.
