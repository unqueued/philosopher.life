I'm working on this until 4pm! =)

* Cleaned up [[Master Curriculum Vitae]]
* Setup FF for building a fuckton of accounts.
* Moving to KeypassXC. Might as well do it now rather than later.
** Lots of problems
* Bookmarks created (I love FF for this!) and organized.
** Although I want my password manager running before I open accounts.
* Setting up [[Background Checks]]
