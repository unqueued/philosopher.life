* Think About It
** https://www.livescience.com/62679-marijuana-negative-memories.html
*** Is it a bad thing to remember more clearly? Optimism isn't necessarily epistemically justified on alethic or prudential accounts.
*** Is it possible that those who remember more clearly are simply more likely to be the ones who end up using cannabis? We don't know which comes first. They need to study people before their MJ use and then after, and they have to control for other variables I'm talking about here.
*** I feel like I see more clearly now than I ever have. Yeah, it's negative and it sucks, but depressive realism might actually be the MORAL choice. Even personal maladaptivity isn't sufficiently problematic in all contexts.
