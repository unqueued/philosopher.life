title: 2017.01.02 - Computer Musings: Autism and Social Technology

One interesting thing about discovering my autism has been the relieving ability to freely admit to myself that I barely understand social communities on the internet. Their network topologies and basic technical use I often understand quickly enough, but the influence of that topology on the social patterns of its members, the power dynamics in these communities, the way in which technology is social, is now understandably foreign to me in some ways. I'm very developmentally challenged in this respect. It's as bad as the fact that I can't remember lyrics to songs in a way that even children and senile people can.
