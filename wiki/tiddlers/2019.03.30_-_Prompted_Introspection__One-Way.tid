!! Tell about a time when you met someone famous.

Famous to whom? Name dropping philosophers will be cool with philosophers. I suppose the most well-known in general is what I'll go for here. I shook Desmond Tutu's hand, and that dude is a nobel peace prize winner. I don't know what counts as //met// either. Fuck this shit, I've met a semblance of my [[Saints]] through reading. Those are the famous folks who I have a [[Unidirectional Mode]] relationship with.
