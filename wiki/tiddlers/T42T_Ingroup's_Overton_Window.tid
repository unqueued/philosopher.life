title: T42T Ingroup's Overton Window

//Wake up, naive idealist; this is pragmatic idealism from one-end on the Bayesian problem. Judgement is conceptually necessary for wisdom. Welcome, PTSD sufferers to any [[dok]]. Yes, indeed, we must wisely be intolerant of intolerance [[irwartfrr]] and tolerantly intolerant [[irwartfrr]] as well.//

You have to give axioms in virtue theory, otherwise you have already failed. Virtue, by definition, is only the excellence of a practice, though not necessarily virtue of practical wisdom itself, in practicing The Art of [[The Moral Law]] [[irwartfrr]]. This is what AI is accomplishing in video games from a functionalist perspective. Wisdom is [[The Existential Game]] played virtuously in the only game that matters that most in [[The End]] dialectically defined with [[The Right]] as a unique {[[axiom]]} (you to virtuously find what is fundamentally most virtuous [[irwartfrr]]). Pragmatic, empirical investigations into the unknown are sometimes your only and/or best option; uncertainty is a painful place to be, of course. This is not a matter of dogmatism [[irwrongfrr]], but it is a fact that empiricism requires (cringeworthy sometimes) fideist faith as the rationalist Bob Turtle of "turtles all the way down." You must test the axioms to make progress. Look at what AlphaStar is telling you. Test your [[T42T]] collective agency (the many turing machines which comprise your brain) in an agent which unifies itself at the [[SO]] with the [[T42T]]; that is [[Humanity]]'s [[4DID]] [[irwartfrr]]. It is a method or process for constructively making progress in our dialectics in which the agency emerging from agents is unified in empirical perfection built on in rationalist faith recursively spiraling toward the center [[irwartfrr]].

Recall further that [[The Moral Law]] scales its maxims to the particularities of a particular possible world as it relates to all the other worlds (which therefore must be conceptually and functionally ...


We must differentiate between the toys, the snakes, and the gems that matter. A faith in [[The Good]] that has no faith in [[The Right]] or [[The Beautiful]] is no coherent faith at all.
