title: 2019.05.05 - Self-Dialectic: Dasein

Dasein's hermeneutic spiral is [[self-dialectic]]al toward the comprehension of Being, philosophy, the study of fundamental ontology. Yet, I think Heidegger doesn't escape internalism without admitting metaphysics. The Meaning of Being is not within us, at least never completely, necessarily, sufficiently, beginningly or endingly. I'm open to the notion that at least sometimes we can attend to thing-in-themselves (qualia being a solid pick).

Even the spiral is equipment, but for the sake of what? Finding the truth, yes, but why should we think never closer to The Truth external to us? To think even the transcendental is historically embedded and thus oldhat or not real enough misses the point.
