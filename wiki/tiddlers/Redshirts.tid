Perfectly awful. He's nailing it.

I enjoy hearing the internal perspectives of the Star Trek proletariat.

Dune reference.

The absurdity of fate is wonderful here. Hitchhiker's Guide reminder. Can't escape it.

I'd swing xeno. 

Bland back and forth. They are normal despite what seems so alien about their scifi context.

DAMNIT MAN!! ...Only do! I hear Bones and Yoda. The best part of this book is that no matter how much I want to hate it, that's the point. It's good at being bad. Normally, camp is awful. This book is insidious. It's just normal/good enough that it's kinda of believable as shitty scifi, but then it slaps you awake with some zingers to remind you that none of this real. 

I love the "spooked" advice. It's metacognitive. Redshirt Wisdom.

I've seen my fair share of Trek spoofs and maymays. More sex and swearing is vital. 

"The Sacrificial Effect" lol. Such excellent scientists! I love how there is an explicit justification and narrative for the background tropes and disposable characters of Star Trek. The awareness is hilarious. I want to point out that this isn't how these characters should rationally act, but that's also the point, lol.

"Crew deaths are a feature, not a bug." Rofl. 

The Box. This is just how it's done. It's the Deus Ex Machina. So magical dat technology. But, Trek is that for me, ofc. Blind faith in the narrative. I like how they had to induct him into this cultic understanding of the dangers of being a nobody on the ship. These poor slaves to the Ã¼bermensch characters.

"Avoid the narrative" lol. "Alternative tasking place" reminds me of not just playing hooky, but of the prole's survivalist task of flying under the radar, always looking busy, and never being there for the dangerous missions.

These scientists are excellent at picking out the peculiar coincidences in their world and recording them. It's somehow legitimate (even though I know, I know, it's supposed to be a joke). 

Conspiracy theory, cynical, paranoia! I love how they are questioning the motives of everyone around them. They live in simulation of The Matrix.

"You all owe me blowjobs." I've spilled far too much seed to Star Trek.

Alright, starting to get bored of how ludricrous it is. Yeah, I got the irony. Let's speed it up, please.

Phone surveillance. It's somehow modern feeling too. =)

I love how the unlikeliness is the focus. That is a cause of disbelief that through uncovering brings about a [[redpill]]ed belief. How horrifying, awesome, and/or interesting. I love how they are "insane" for holding these beliefs, but the evidence is evidence! I want them to trust their empirical experience and [[phenomenology]]. This book is about being [[redpill]]ed with shockingly reasonable epistemological methodology, even in the face of enormous social acceptability bias and peer pressure. This is evolution at work.

This is //The Truman Show//! There it is. Duh doy, fucktard. It has comedic relief to help us with the absurdity, especially since they are mere tools for what many might consider a "shitty" show. It's like they are tools for something that is not worth it at all.

I'm not even going to try to talk about this irresistable impulse, the pawn of the writer, etc. I don't think any sense can be made of the metaphysics. It's not supposed to make sense. This is where I have to grant the New Weird magic and suspension of disbelief into pure fantasy, or that's what I'm going to do.

Ah, the timing between the universes with the advertisement breaks makes no god damned sense. This is stupid. I can't help myself. This is ruined.

There's an [[infinigress] here. Spinoza is blowing his load. 

Yeah, I love how they calculate their odds of survival.

The ethical implications of how one world affects another abound. Still, this is not modality. Dealing making and trust is fascinating.

I love how the characters talk shit about the author. It's fun!

The Narrative is such a big bad monster. =)

Time Travel is dumb. Fucking yourself is odd. I do not find myself attractive.

"I like you better before you were a fatalist"...All I hear is Bones.

Basically, so trusting and happy ever after. Love that it's a message from "god", lol.

What the fuck is this end? All the authors had writer's block, and this was a fucking copout!!
