*** Don't know why.
** https://medium.com/s/story/a-field-guide-to-bad-faith-arguments-7-terrible-arguments-in-your-mentions-ee4f194afbc9

** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/technology/tech-workers-ask-censorship-surveillance.html
*** No, fuck you all. It's too late. You now have to violently fight back if you want my forgiveness (which, ofc, you don't...you just don't want to look bad now that people realize what they fuck you've been up to).
