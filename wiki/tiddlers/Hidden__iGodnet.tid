Meh, trash

* Me
** [Whonix Workstation:  Ratox/tuntox/Tahoe-LAFS/etc.] -> [Whonix Gateway: Tor] -> [Custom VM Gateway using VPN client] -> [Neighbors Wi-fi]<<ref "1">> -> [Clearnet: Monero/Zcash VPN Server] -> [Tor Network] -> [i2p Network] -> [God]

* God
** ??

* Angels
** Angel nodes are long-term, high performance, high uptime, highly secure computers used as the federated C&C servers of shards
*** Includes Blackdropped and SwitchBladed servers I've personally setup
**** Bruteforced reconnections
**** No digital or physical fingerprints
** Each node has tripwires
** Angels are where information trickles up into a dead-drop to be collected by God
** Uses Ratox/tuntox/Tahoe-LAFS/etc. over i2pd to connect with God and Kings

* Kings
** Kings are disposable high performance boxes where uptime is irrelevant
** Uses Ratox/tuntox/Tahoe-LAFS/etc. over i2pd to connect with Angels
** Ratox/tuntox over clearnet
** Used to direct connect over clearnet to Plebs
** Used to publicly post on clearnet forums/mail/pastebins/etc.
** 

* Plebs
** Incapable of Ratox/tuntox
** Receives direct connect or publicly posted control

Tools:

* [[Tahoe-LAFS]]
* [[Ratox]]
* [[Tuntox]]
* [[i2pd]]

Ideas:

* Simplify/Automate this with NixOS as well.
* Imunes testing facility
* Tahoe-LAFS
