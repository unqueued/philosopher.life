title: 2017.12.20 - Carpe Diem Log: Beds

* Woke at 9:30
* Woke kids
* Scheduling tasks
* I am reminded that my children have been doing well in their wikis, they've been working hard, and their math is looking good too. My son is crushing 5th grade math in Khan, and my daughter is in Algebra 2.
* Cleaned
* Took apart bunk bed carefully in case we needed it. Not worth salvaging or giving away though. It is pretty banged up.
* Built two new bed+desk combos
* Rearranged room.
* Talked to JRE
* Porkchops
* The Office and couch
