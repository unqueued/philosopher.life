* Daughter needs to work on data-structures and algorithms. I've tried to get her into it many times. I'm going to keep trying. 
* My son and I need to do a re-wiring, and I have that shelf to bring down. 
** Wait until blackwolf comes in. 
** His desk is a mess.
*** Dude, your desk is a fucking mess, lol.
* My son is loving the Big History book. Gonna sac social studies for it because I think it's amazing, and I want to encourage his reading. 
** This may be one of the only ways to improve his English, and I'm delighted that he cares about non-fiction so much. I have a chance to show him [[salience]].
