title: 2017.06.26 - Carpe Diem Log

* The alarm clock awoke me. DCK makes it hard to fall asleep. I dreamt deeply.
* I woke the kids and surfed for a bit while getting ready.
* My wife made lunch for me, and it was delicious.
** Thank you!
* I worked fairly hard, but most of my energy was spent on social considerations. 
* ''I landed a fucking pipefitting job!!!'' Woot woot!
* I called my wife and talked about it with her.
* I came home and talked to the kids about it.
* I called the landlord to get them to fix the fluorescent light and leak.
* I called my brother JRE and talked to him about it.
** He is coming to visit with my cousin!! And, if we're extra lucky, my brother AIR will possibly be joining us as well!
* We started looking for lodging accommodations for me.
** My wife has friends in Charlotte on the lookout as well.
* We made plans with another homeschool family for two weeks from now (right before I leave) to go swimming, plays some board games, chillax, etc.
* We developed more plans for the future. We're thinking ahead, trying to see what options are open, and what the best path is.
* I bumped uglies with muh 'ho. =)
** I also took a shower (I needed one)
* We made dinner; grilled cheese, veggies, and soup.
* We watched an episode of GoT.
* I cleaned my nails exceptionally well today.
* I helped my daughter wash the dishes.
* My parents wanted to video chat. We will get in touch.
* I need to contact my brothers and cousins with DND rules; I'll build characters for them if they prefer that.
* I'm going to have some sorbet and chillax with Rick and Morty before falling asleep.
