*** As much I appreciate //The Blank Slate// (and I have disagreements with it), I really am disappointed in his later work. This is no accident. The man is clearly a profound psychopath, and I am not surprised by the brand of alt-right psychopaths who come out of the woodwork holding up his arguments.
*** Also, BUUURRRNN!!

* Confirm My Bias

*** Very much enjoyed the discussion

*** I am sad to see it has become this. I absolutely despise T_D, but I must fight for their political right here. It's disgusting, but the dialectic is this sacrosanct. This is not a tolerance problem. I demand self-controlled filters and ways to increase my signal-to-noise ratio (we all need it). This problems arises from a lack of incentives to produce open-source standards of filtering and searching content, in digital and informational autonomy.

*** Science isn't very scientific when it doesn't engage in the process as a whole correctly. The incentives are all wrong.

*** They are IQ tests.

*** I am a harm reduction advocate. Clearly, however, one must think carefully about how incentives operate. Opioids are a class of drugs I'm unwilling to touch until right before my death (they are the last thing on my bucket list, and only just right before I kick it). We need to make other drugs legal, abolish IP, and socialize in order to solve these kinds of problems. Otherwise, we feed completely different incentives an prison-industrial-complex models.

* Think About It
** http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2018-03/pe.html
*** I don't see how this is real zealotry. 

* Fishy
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/economy/user-data-pay.html
*** Ah, it sounds like just another sleight of hand to keep you in capitalism. There is a Randian virus we must cure.
** https://www.gq.com/story/democrats-bank-deregulation-vote
*** This is not a call for a fix to the problem. It's actually not extreme enough in calling out the DNC. On the surface, it says something quite correct. But, the lack of analysis, and the way in which the author does not actually hold the party accountable (pretending that it is somehow truly not criminal like the RNC, just not to the same degree) is problematic. Perhaps I am wrong here, of course, because these are strong words. I am just worried that they aren't strong enough for maliciously ignorant reasons.

*** Really? You have helped put these people in power.

*** I tell you. If I were an enterprising enterprise, I would actually research DDoS techniques and sell my services in preventing them. I'd buy time off botnets anonymously and create a ruckus in which people saw me defuse situations quickly. This would generate enormous interest in my services and notariety. Importantly, it could not be traced back to me, and I'd already have naive (yet intelligent) goon admins that would take the credit. Boom. Honestly, that sort of plan is probably a regular occurence.
