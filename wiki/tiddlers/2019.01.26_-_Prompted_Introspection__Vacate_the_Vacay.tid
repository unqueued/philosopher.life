title: 2019.01.26 - Prompted Introspection: Vacate the Vacay

!! Tell about your worst vacation.

I was wrong in my last answer: [[2017.11.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Worst Vacation]]. I'm tired of the pointless violence and abuse I received growing up that did me no good. Some of it was useful; most was unjustified. Vacations weren't exactly vacations in those moments. You know something is wrong when you need to vacate your vacation.
