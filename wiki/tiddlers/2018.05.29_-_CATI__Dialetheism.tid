title: 2018.05.29 - CATI: Dialetheism

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/

<<<
A dialetheia is a sentence which is both true and false.
<<<

firmissimum omnium principiorum := the most certain of all principles, the Law of Non-Contradiction, LNC, etc.

<<<
[A] dialetheist manifests her dialetheism in accepting, together with the LNC, sentences that are inconsistent with it, that is, true sentences whose negations are true: dialetheias.
<<<

I'm not sure what that fully means.

<<<
Dialetheism should be clearly distinguished from trivialism. This is the view that all contradictions are true (and hence, assuming that a conjunction entails its conjuncts, it is also the view that everything is true).
<<<

This must be defended. Why do I not get to surd-elim into every contradiction being true? Perhaps this is modal, some kind of a dialectic necessary for the possibility of meaning at all.

<<<
Though a trivialist must be a dialetheist, the converse is not the case: a dialetheist typically claims that some (and, usually, very specific) sentences are dialetheias, not that all of them are. 
<<<

Umm...What is happening here? Why do we think that the trivialist is committed to a contrasting claim like: "all sentences are dialetheias." They don't obviously have to, right? Perhaps so. But, I'm worried that whatever move you make to show it true of the trivialist, the same method can be applied to the dialetheist.

<<<
The standard solution for the dialetheist consists in subscribing to the view that entailment (deductively valid inference) is paraconsistent.
<<<

Wait, are we talking about syntax or semantics here? What kinds of moves are allowed to make in a proof vs. the incompleteness correspondence problem of mapping onto semantics?

<<<
A general conception of entailment (and, by extension, a logic that captures such a conception) is explosive if, according to it, a contradiction entails everything (ex contradictione quodlibet: for all A and B: A,¬A ⊢ B). It is paraconsistent if and only if (iff) it is not explosive.
<<<

Hrmm...

The Paraconsistent Logic page says this:

<<<
The argument ex contradictione quodlibet (ECQ) is paraconsistently invalid: in general, it is not the case that A, ¬A⊨B.
<<<

Um, those are two different claims guys. At this level you don't get to help yourself to saying it syntactically in one place and semantically in other.

<<<
 those who embrace a form of logical pluralism on the nature of entailment (see Beall and Restall, 2006), can be weak paraconsistentists: they can treat inconsistent models, in which contradictions hold, as useful mathematical tools without admitting that they represent real possibilities.
<<<

Sounds like imaginary numbers to me.

<<<
Sometimes, a further sub-distinction is made between strong paraconsistency and dialetheism (see Priest, Beall and Armour-Garb, 2004, p. 6): the former admits ‘real possibilities' in which contradictions can be true; the latter makes the final step, and accepts true contradictions simpliciter, that is, contradictions that are true at the actual world. 
<<<

Fascinating claim. I would like to understand if dialetheias are necessary, possible, or other truths? Does this expose a fundamental problem in notion of modality? 

It is interesting to see Aristotle favor the LNC but fight against the LEM (Law of Excluded Middle, De Interpretatione, Chapter 9) in considering future contingents.

<<<
the current debate on logical paradoxes may be viewed as a ramification and formal specification of the Kant-Hegel dialectics.
<<<

Preach, yo!

<<<
According to Kant (at least in one way of resolving the antinomies), the fallacy lies in treating the world as a whole as an object — in mistaking a subjective condition for an objective reality.
<<<

My God, this man saw so far. I stand in awe.

<<<
Now, according to Hegel such a conception has something to be said for it as well as against it. Kant has a point in showing, via the antinomies, that dialectics is “a necessary function of reason”; in defending “the necessity of the contradiction which belongs to the nature of thought determinations” (Hegel, 1831, p. 56.) However, Kant mistakenly imputes objectification, as an error, to reason: the result is only the familiar one that reason is incapable of knowing the Absolute, that is, actual reality. On the contrary, we should abandon such “tenderness for the things of this world”, and the idea that “the stain of contradiction ought not to be in the essence of what is in the world; it has to belong only to thinking reason” (Hegel, 1830, p. 92.) Contrary to what Kant held, the Kantian antinomies are not a reductio of the illusions of reason. They are perfectly sound arguments, deducing the dialetheic nature of the world (for a reconstruction of this Kantian-Hegelian debate, see Part II of Priest 1995).
<<<

Thank you, thank you, thank you. This is exactly the issue!

Inconsistency, according to received wisdom, cannot be coherently reasoned about. 
<<<

Inconstistency cannot be consistently reasoned about. That seems definitionally true, yo.
