title: 2018.11.10 - kickscondor: Unmoved Movers

Dear kicks,

Your title "Self-Made Doorways" is a significant bootstrapping notion to me. It reminds me of [[The Unmoved Mover]]. I think you continue to enter into this ancient debate with me. Thank you.

<<<
https://www.kickscondor.com/self-made-doorways

how can I ‘link’ to the ten related tabs I might have open so that you can see them together? How can you create your own ‘link’ that puts me into the center of a hypertext perspective you have?
<<<

With browser extensions, it's reasonable to handle collections of links. Browser sessions can be transported too. But, how we tailor our browsers and DEs define quite a bit of one's hypertext perspective, imho. If you need a sledgehammer, you can push entire VMs or allow someone to VNC. I think my desktop environment is part of what makes my hyperreading function as it does. How do I send you complex forms of externalized cognition? Somehow, I think you need to be sitting in the pilot's seat to really have the full perspective.

<<<fed
In some ways, this reminds me of heavily cross-referenced and footnoted texts like religious scripture—which are hyperlinked in a fashion—and folks have long batched together references to these works through verse-chapter or page citations, and most often through quotes.
<<<

Preach, yo. That is, in no small part, the inspiration for how I engage in my [[Straussian]] work.

<<<
Is it possible that citation could be improved by allowing one to construct a link of views to many definitive hypertexts?
<<<

I'm not sure about the value of it for citations, but perhaps I have too narrow a concept of citation here. I think the link I sent you warps you into a semblance of my perspective. There's too much implicit in perspective to easily make it explicit, and I think of citations as being excruciatingly explicit and unmistakably narrow. The two must be bridged for the world to be intelligible. I hope to build bridges into my mind (and I'd like bridges into the minds of others as an autist).

Relatedly, this is one of the reasons I'm tempted to move to Bob/nodeJS. Maintaining multiple tabs or workspaces containing the same wiki but different doorways is powerful for me. There are times where I've got 10 tiddlers open, but then I need to temporarily switch gears, and I'd rather leave them in place to start another session and bounce between the two (the way I do it currently would present something like race conditions if I tried). Multi-editor Tiddlywiki, if and when it is fully functioning, may force me to accept going that route for development.

<<<
I wonder what tools you find most useful—are they just useful within Reddit or should they be available to you and I somehow?
<<<

My goal with Reddit is to sweep and leave immediately. I've been addicted to that site for far too long. I don't want to spend a single minute more of my time than I must in order to curate things to consume; I don't trust myself.

I don't think you use Reddit without a bunch of non-standard tools either. You clearly care a great deal about your browser with a tool like [[Tridactyl|https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl]]/Vimperator. I believe I have nothing new at all to show you on this front.

* Ad Nauseum
* All Tabs Helper
* Paywall bypassers/Sci-hub access alert
* Autotab discard
* RES
* Owl
* etc.

Browsers are generalized enough they are like GUI terminals; I tailor my terminals. Add-ons, scripts, and tweaks make or break a browser to me (especially as browsers evolve over time). The desktop environment makes a big difference too. When you've got trees of hundreds of tabs open, you'll want to be able to navigate and construct them without friction. But, again, I don't think I'm saying anything new to you.

Reddit itself is also a very tailorable experience. You build doorways to fit a context, and you can have multiple contexts. Searching Reddit is its own problem; Google is the best option, but even it is flawed.

<<<
(I wonder if you’ll agree with this:) I think the point isn’t to make your wiki the Penn Station of philosophy—I just think some valuable things will bubble up out of your project that will connect to Penn Station bidirectionally. Just like I might draw from Vigoleis or Dr. Strangelove from time to time—philosopher.life is in there, too.
<<<

Maybe I agree to it. It depends on what you mean. Now's a good time to call me a dogmatic, arrogant sum'bitch^^tm^^. I will address your charge as carefully as I can.

{[[About]]} and {[[Principles]]} attempt to address this as clearly as I can say it so far, though they may be wildly incorrect (and not my destination). What do you think philosophers are trying to do? Saint Aristotle is literally trying to understand what matters about reality as best as he possibly can. I don't think his goal was to be famous, though he obviously became integral to Penn Station.<<ref "ar">> He was shooting to build Penn Station, and I think every systematic philosopher should. Do I expect myself to try to live up to my teacher? Yes. Do I predict I will succeed? No. I have [[hope]] that it is possible, and I will try. Also, whether or not something changes history is also different from whether or not it should. Finding these answers is also different from providing something which enables others to do so.

I'd like to think I'm not half-assing it here, and I'm not looking for a half-assed answer. I'm going for broke. I have no idea what this thing will become before I die, and I consider that a good thing (because I know I don't have the answers I need yet). Yeah, I aim to make something epic here. I'm two years into setting the stage for this [[monster|Monster-Φ]]; I hope I have the resolve and resources to throw down for another twenty years or more if I'm lucky (I do not predict I'll live much beyond 50). I know the odds are against me; I know those who have walked this path in the desert have often gone insane and killed themselves. YOLO. No regr//a//ts. I aim to be blameless before [[The Moral Law]] all the way down in my context. I aim for philosophical virtue regardless of recognition.

This won't be Penn Station for others, but it is Penn Station for me. I think it is possible this object will be incredibly valuable to my audience as well; I simply don't know. I aim to address [[The Great Human Conversation]] holding nothing back. I do not think I can succeed in somehow finally answering the unanswerable, but I must try. Further, I don't predict many will pay attention. I do not aim to live my life as a popularity contestant (at least not in any standard sense). I hope you are right that some valuable things bubble up for [[others]] in my wiki; I'm shooting for far more for at least those who are going to listen carefully (which is primarily myself).

<<<
I guess I try to manipulate the feed, too, so yeah, of course he’s manipulating the feed.
<<<

I'm saying something very specific here. I suggest you've falsely conflated the difference in motivations and acts for each of you, bypassing my claim. Do you really treat others as //mere// means in how you influence the feed? Do you really not see [[others]] as something like ends in themselves? There is nothing conceptually wrong with an upvote or downvote; it depends on the context of the act and your motivation. Nadella's motivations are evil; are yours? Are you sure you are claiming to be engaged in actions morally equivalent to Nadella's? I have a hard time believing it.

<<<
 Why I’m reluctant to just pin the award on him: I’m not sure he’s actually accomplishing what he claims to be.
<<<

A manipulator doesn't have to be successful; you can be a profoundly ineffective manipulator. Moral motivation matters.

If I stick you in a room with a button that will inject a lethal dosage of morphine into some innocent child strapped in a chair in front of you, you are responsible for why you push or don't push that button, regardless of the outcome. Under most circumstances, it would be immoral to push the button. We can imagine cases in which it may be morally acceptable or even obligatory for you to push that button, e.g. the kid is terminally ill and suffering torturous pain until they die. I could pay some kid actor to appear to die in front of you if you push the button. Even if nobody gets hurt, you have done something profoundly wrong in choosing to push that button from immoral motivations. Consequences only conditionally matter, but moral motivation (goodwill) has unconditional merit. 

<<<
 I love that he’s put all of this work into influencing Hacker News, but his boasting about it could clearly undo all that work—so what kind of master manipulator are we really dealing with here?

The short-term efforts undermine the long-term—his infrastructure is not nearly as sound as it seems.
<<<

His boasting could backfire on him. That doesn't mean he isn't a manipulator. People don't have to be master manipulators to be effective either. The placebo effect can operate even when you know its placebo. Advertising works no matter how hard you try to convince yourself it doesn't. Trump the Abomination is no master manipulator, and yet he is still president. Nadella's public claim does not conceptually eliminate his efficacy or his guilt. 

Astroturfing with an army of workers behind you is easy; China is a shining example. It's quite real here in the U.S. as well. Manipulating those algorithms can be done with a handful of people behind VPNs or a botnet (a single person dedicated to the cause can make serious waves). It doesn't have to be some absolute mind-control; even the nudges can snowball and butterfly effect.

Memetic warfare is real and clearly effective. It's an ancient art which we continue to improve upon.

<<<
Yeah, man, good questions.  
<<<

I think you deftly avoided my questions. You will continue to face this problem with me as a librarian: you're engaged in ethics. Once you start asking "what is relevant?" or "what's the point?" you're going to hit that metaethical foundation. It appears you don't like most of the options in front of you. I can appreciate that.

<<<
I think the trolls are way ahead in this effort—I think they see that they can create games that are honeypots. 
<<<

I'm talking about institutions far more evil and powerful than 4chan trolls (whom I also take to be non-trivially influential on the internet). Karmawhores and trolls are almost the least of my concerns. Professional manipulation is pervasive and real.

<<<
And I do think that the Internet still holds the power to flip the structure so that it is the powerful who get caught in these games that they think they can play. (Thus, the meme warfare centers.)
<<<

I agree that the internet can be used to decentralize power, but just because it holds this potential doesn't mean it's actualized or even likely to obtain in the future. I'm here to fight even though I think we're losing and are going to lose. 

<<<
 I think the trouble is that trolls are chaotic and can align anyway they like—evil, neutral and good—are even ‘neutral’ and ‘good’ more likely to turn out to be ‘evil’ than vice versa? On the other hand, chaotics have been the Robin Hoods, the Guy Fawkeses, the Snowdens perhaps. I think we benefit by tapping into that subversive light-heartedness.
<<<

I ask for your clarification, please. I have a foot in both camps here, and it seems alignment perspectives in D&D are incoherent. I am not sure what you mean by subversive light-heartedness. Subversiveness need not be chaotic, and I don't think these are matters which we should be light-hearted about. `/pitchfork`

<<<
Oh—I like your arguments, answers and agreements on the T42T outlines. I think this also goes in with my thoughts on what I called ‘pluralism’ (but which really just means ‘a multimodal system of thinking’)—just as one needs to both ‘quantify’ and restrain from such a thing, just as one must respond in kind, respond with a token, respond with a tome (and never know precisely if one is doing it ‘right’)—it is always a constant balancing in a battle of extremes and competing ideals.
<<<

Agreed!

<<<
Much like a relationship is a balance between what I am looking for and you are looking for.
<<<

This is an important issue for [[Find The Others]] and [[The Original Position]]. I'm glad you call it a balance because it implies you think there is a right answer! I suggest the external standard of the good of our relationship does not mean the balance is 50/50, but so do you. It depends on the context of all contexts.

<<<
So also I look at socialism and capitalism as arrows in my quiver; left and right as sides of myself more than two religions at war. This is overly simplistic—but so is T42T, it is a useful starting place for me. It is not the end, it is the curated entry point. It is the self-made doorway.
<<<

I have both in me as well. We don't have to call them religions, but they are clearly profound belief systems which take some matters on faith (which is our inescapable plight). I suggest some arrows are simply more effective than others, especially in particular contexts. 

I cannot say it is not [[The End]]. Curated by whom or what? Self-made by what self? Reality and truth are external to us. 

<<<
(The remainder of your letter—the part that essentially argues for staking a position—I am going to digest and figure out how to respond. I don’t have any problem with what you’re saying in a general sense; it is principled. I, personally, cannot get myself to ratchet down to anything concrete, for some reason. I think part of it is that I really do enjoy human beings—I am hard-staked against misanthropy—and that puts me in a really weird place wrt to modern culture and forming an alliance with a group rather than an individual. But if the mindset is totally bereft, then I am willing to abandon it.)
<<<

I appreciate your willingness to digest and respond. I can appreciate the humility in not wanting to put down anything concrete. 

You are putting a stake down in the desert: you are against misanthropy! I think that is a wonderful starting place to put a stake down in the desert. I do not think the mindset is bereft, but it may take you down a hermeneutic circle/spiral. I ask you to define misanthropy. You will see me choose to use the words "humanity" and "Humanity" differently, and try to do so on purpose. I suggest you are actually after the concept of personhood.

`/salute`

<<<
(As far as the TiddlyWiki loader: I am also waiting for more inspiration there. I think of that prototype as ‘chapter one’—I usually have to batch up ideas and code fragments in order to realize them. But glad it got the conversation going. I am thinking a lot about versioning—for example, can the timestamp also be part of the curated doorway that is the undercurrent of this exchange?)
<<<

I will continue to think about it too. Timestamps of tiddlers won't work unless we break into the internals. They are often wrong. For example, I'll retroactively add things to my timeline. I'm still not sure how to do it well though. I am still pleased to have a timeline I've built by hand in the wiki and one built from versioning the wiki.

<<<
https://www.kickscondor.com/how-writing-%27my-struggle%27-undid-knausguard

When can a ‘body’ be called done—what are the utilities of this moment, how do you see it coming?
<<<

Define [[The End]], the unified goal, and then we might be able to define the subgoals. Whether or not someone finishes, of course, is different from whether or not they ought to stop. For my own case, it is possible I will eventually change radically enough that I will stop writing. That does not appear to be where the trend is going in my life, but what do I know? For now, I don't see an end in sight to the body of my work except death. Perhaps other authors who have gone down this path thought the same (a crazy bunch).

I hope to read the first book. I want to see how others do it and learn. Thank you for the reading recommendation.

<<<
For my own sake, I wonder how I might foment a reaction to the logorrheic approach that offers restraint—my Tuesdays and Fridays, for one—although I still end up feeling thoroughly logorrheic and I think I do exhaust anyone passing through. But: I feel to question this approach (hardly to demonize it) but what could a Reverse Knausguard ‘body’ style itself as?
<<<

I'm on the extreme end of course. I would be perfectly fine reading far more of your writing than you elect to output, particularly since it's the only way I get to know you (which matters to me). I can be hard to exhaust in some respects. Though you pursue [[Others]] broadly, I am not sure what you are looking for in [[Others]] as your audience. I'm still figuring out the shape of the body as you evolve it.

A starting place for the opposite style seems like poetry or crystallized summation. It only shows semblances, outlines, glimpses, fragments, and impressions on purpose. I think it must be [[antipleonasmic]].

<<<
What does the non-linear hypertext bring to the table?
<<<

Contexts, angles, perspectives, rhizomes, and object-oriented ontology.

I step back and, man, all the burgeoning technology out there is at complete odds with the other! 
<<<

Sounds dialectical to me. =)

<<<
Big problem, though: Beaker (Dat[3]) doesn’t store differences. And TiddlyWiki is one big file. So every time you save, it keeps the old one saved and the network starts to fill with these old copies...Beaker is great for your basic blog or smattering of pages. It remains to be seen how this would be solved: differencing? Breaking up TiddlyWiki? Storing in JSON?
<<<

I think it depends on how you use TW. Most of the heavy users and gurus I've met don't use the single file approach.<<ref "d">> [[Sphygmus]], for example, prefers nodeJS. They don't serve static files at all, so Beaker is likely the wrong tool no matter how you bend it. However, you can serve TW entirely [[statically|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Generating%2520Static%2520Sites%2520with%2520TiddlyWiki.html]]. Are you ready for ~7k glorious tiny static html files linking to each other? Dat is, right? Unfortunately, almost everyone builds internally dynamic content in TW,<<ref "l">> and more importantly, I think search is so fundamental that you can't give it up.<<ref "s">>

Conjecture: it should be possible to have an absolute bare minimum stripped down static TW [[lazy-loading|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/LazyLoading.html]]/serving external static tiddler files. A minimal TW with just enough javascript to load up .tid/.html files on demand should be feasible. To my knowledge, this doesn't exist.<<ref "k">> It should though, right? I find even https://tiddlywiki.com/static to be such a pain in the ass to use without the dynamic content, but it serves up fast and Google appears to strongly prefer indexing it over a TW js-blob.<<ref "i">> This could be further tailored for Dat, wherein the lion's share of the metadata index of tiddlers could be externalized and even chunked.

I have used Resilio Sync since it came out; I am still convinced it is the gold standard for consumer-grade performance in this arena, but even it is flawed.<<ref "r">> It is my opinion that one of the mistakes that these tools make is default archiving without sane restrictions. I think the private key holder should be able to set the default for the swarm on this (which isn't to say it shouldn't be overridable), since they are most likely to know how best to wield it.

The diff problem is a big one. I am surprised that Dat doesn't enable one to effortlessly rely upon something like Git (why reinvent the wheel?). Torrentified Git is hawt.

<<<
Or do I just regenerate a new hash, a new Dat every time I publish?
<<<

That's basically the IPFS/IPNS way, right?

<<<
Where I Lean: I think I side with Beaker here. TiddlyWiki is made for browsers that haven’t focused on writing. But if it could be tailored to Beaker—to save in individual files—a Dat website already acts like a giant file, like a ZIP file. And I think it makes more sense to keep these files together inside a Dat rather than using HTML as the filesystem.
<<<

I can appreciate that. It's interesting that you think these are at odds to this extent, though I agree with much of your analysis. Obviously, I'm absurdly [[biased|Poem: Inconceivable]]; you're going to have to pry my horcrux-pensieve monolith from my cold dead hands. I know you understand this better than I do, but it feels like you are comparing apples and oranges a bit here (which you imply). Tiddlywiki is a file; Dat is a protocol. //Friction//, rather than pure head-to-head, I get it. Clearly, this friction may disappear over time too. I take it you are still asking roughly the following:

For now, if I only get to rely upon one of them, which one do I choose?

It's hard to imagine being nearly as productive in a tool which isn't Tiddlywiki, [[2018.10.18 - TWGGF: TW Competition]]. For me, that might just settle the matter. However, I realize others aren't obsessive maniacs (poor souls), and it can also be easier to design some visions outside of TW.

I am also, as you know, a pessimist about Dat. I've tasted a lot of decentralization tools which have come and gone in the Wild West of the desert. I've watched it for a long time, and I'm still not sure that Dat is going to make it. I am, however, strongly convinced that Tiddlywiki will remain usable for a long time.<<ref "w">> In risk analysis, I'm having a very hard time not betting on TW over Dat. HTML (and, by extension, unfortunately, JS) is a first-class agnostic citizen in computing.

Insofar as they can be peeled apart, what should take precedence: how or what I transfer?

There are 10,000 ways to transfer files, and TW's compilation-portability is exceptional. I can just e-mail the complete document, push it across messaging apps, compress and encode my complete wiki onto a piece of paper,<<ref "p">> steganographically append it to maymays to distribute on imageboards, throw it on yet another blockchain, pastebin it, sneakernet it with USBs, and serve it on any filehosting solution. Almost anyone can serve my wiki on almost any platform. TW defeats a number of frictions like a champion. I posit that TW is radically more decentralization-capable than Dat. Legions of analog and digital systems can move one file, but it is possible only few will speak Dat.

Why shackle myself to a particular "how" something will be transferred when data transport is constantly evolving and always under profound threat from those in power? In the heap of crumbling, finicky, fragile stacks over the decades, I'm convinced TW has a real chance of surviving and maintaining usability.

I think TW is a complete, gorgeous hack; it's an application written in languages for which every computer has a virtual machine. My money is on WASM-Web 3.0 taking further down that rabbithole. In time, Dat may become relevant, perhaps even dominant. I [[hope]] so. If that day comes, I'm confident that Dat and TW ecosystems will both have evolved enough that they will play nicely together. 

To my eyes, Dat is competing with IPFS, Syncthing, Resilio Sync, [[mutable torrents|http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0044.html]], etc. For now, I just use Resilio Sync for the functional Dat-properties I need.<<ref "b">> I'm still on the hunt for a solid alternative to this proprietary hell.

<<<
A mutation of Datasette that appeals to me is: a static HTML site that stores all its data in a single file database—the incomparable SQLite.
<<<

I can see the force of that. This point may extend very far too. It may be the case with WASM is going to usher in full-stacks of high-performance software to replace what TW is doing. Perhaps it will move us away from the mainframe model of the cloud, though I suggest it will be used to entrench Google's power and further proprietarize the web slowly converting into the generalized internet. In the end, why use javascript if you don't have to? I'd guess that's at least a decade away though.

<<<
And TiddlyWiki is all JavaScript. Internal dynamism vs Indieweb’s external dynamism.
<<<

I think you should expand on this point. The way I use it, yeah (though, there may be hacks around this too). It's pretty clear to me that nodeJS TW can be integrated into the Indieweb. The Indieweb is duct-taped together, and it seems like TW on nodeJS is just another server stack which can be taped into it, right?

I think it makes sense not to commit yourself to Tiddlywiki for Unix principles. It's hard to beat the flexibility, resilience, and longevity of flat textfiles, but that is almost definitionally committing to non-committing. I like both extremes. I am still working (poorly) to have my cake and eat it too.

<<<
I’ve been wrestling with trying to get this blog hooked up to Mastodon—just out of curiosity. But I gave up. What’s the point? Anyone can use a web browser to get here. Well, yeah, I would like to communicate with everyone using their chosen home base.
<<<

I have a graveyard of distribution methods and ideas. I think about them, try a couple out, nobody cares, and I'm back to the usual; cool story, bro. I want decentralization to win, but I am convinced it is not going to happen at large scale as people conveniently live their digital lives on fewer and fewer (yet larger and larger) centralized computing platforms. It may even be shut out. I desperately hope I'm wrong in my prediction. I am open to migrating wherever I need to.

<<<
 (Secure Scuttlebutt is furthered obscured by simply not being accessible through any web browser I know of; there are mobile apps.)
<<<

That is an infuriating problem. Mobile-first is killing me. Of course, this wiki has no business being used on a phone (not without serious aid), but it may on VR. Federation rather than P2P is usually a result of: NATing, throttling, mobile constraints, and limited capitalist incentives to distribute power.<<ref "2">>

<<<
https://www.kickscondor.com/hermetically-sealed-podcasts

I’m wondering if the rise of podcasts is a reaction to the threat of algorithms. Basically, since podcasts are binary audio files, algorithms currently can’t rewrite the thing—it acts as a hermetically sealed container containing humans talking.
<<<

As you point out, they are sealed for now. They can be rewritten by hand (with proper tooling), but there's not a good automated method. I suggest the ways in which people find and talk about podcasts is strongly algorithmic.

Podcasts can be convenient (especially when filling in gaps in our days) and I suggest may //feel// more authentic to others as well, but I'm not convinced the hermetic seals are the trick. There's something wrong with me though since I really struggle to come up with podcasts I find worth my time (I'd rather hyperread or have an audiobook instead of a podcast). Podcasts seem like decentralized talk radio to me.

Outside of podcasts, I think video is the major hermetic container. It continues to sweep us up. One cause (or effect) may be that reading (as well as IQ scores) has been in slow decline across the first world for decades (though I am hopeful it can rise again).

<<<
This also applies to the TiddlyWiki approach—by having the entire HTML in a single file, it also could be seen as ‘hermetically sealed’—tho secret JS and analytics could still be there (as they could with podcasts). I also wonder if this is the appeal of Reddit’s minimalist design.
<<<

I think it's only hermetically sealed in the sense that Google AMP and similar forced packaging from other giants work to dictate a market in which they penalize someone for using anything like Tiddlywiki. If you want to have a voice in the walled-gardens, you better construct their walled-garden with them on their terms or you're out in the cold.

I must be misunderstanding something since I do not see how Reddit's minimalist design is a reaction to the threat of algorithms. Conde Naste's incentives for shaping and wielding those algorithms, increasing censorship, the usual eternal seasonal decline in signal-to-noise ratio, and a continued bent towards mobile are threats to how I use it.

Here's where I profoundly agree with the appeal of the hermetic seal of Tiddlywiki: you are more likely to have the chance to see my words in context. I don't want one limb to be easily separated from the body. I want you to have access to it all or nothing. I want my integrated representation of my [[4DID]] to remain intact. Perhaps the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and if so, I want you to have access to that emergence. To the extent that it is up to us, I think it is a disservice to both of us to only transmit distorted fragments.

Alright, that's my tome for today. As usual, it's been a pleasure thinking with and about you, kicks.

Sincerely,

h0p3
