title: 2018.01.08 - Computer Musings: HTTPS

I setup HTTPS again. I forgot why it failed. It really doesn't mean much since this is extremely static. However, there may come a time where I want interactive, dynamic services that would benefit from having the certification. Thus, I fixed it.

I took at a shot at running a Matrix server. But, after trying the clients, I'm pretty sad.

It is so clear that socialism (owning the means of production) and the hacker-ethic go hand-in-hand. The hacker-ethic is about owning your tools and data. It's about not being stuck in a system in which I am powerless. Informational socialism.
