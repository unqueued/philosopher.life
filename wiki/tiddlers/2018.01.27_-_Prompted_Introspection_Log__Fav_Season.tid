title: 2018.01.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Fav Season

!! What is your favorite season and why?

I see my life as coming in seasons, eras, etc. But, I take it you mean the standard seasons of the year. I suppose I'm not allowed to offer any clever answers like: whatever seasons on average tend to increase my family's overall utility.<<ref "2019.03.23">> I don't want to give you a non-answer.

I'm not a fan of Winter and Summer because it is not comfortable to be outside for too long. Spring and Fall are generally the same. Fall is often the beginning of a new year for me in a sense (school), and Spring the end. Both tend to be exhilarating in their own way. Spring tends to have the most comfortable weather for me, although Fall is more beautiful. I like the idea of Spring more than Fall. 

Overall, on average, throughout my life, I would answer Fall. Right now, I think the scale tips in Spring's favor. 

What I don't understand: why is this a valuable question?
