!! What was the first way you earned money?

I'm not exactly sure what counts as earning money. I am sure that even as a young child I asked for money, and that is a kind work. "Earn" has a notion of merit to it, and you need to define the standard of merit to have an effective answer.

Having grown up so fucking poor, money was a treasure for me. It is part of why I have been so frugal in some respects. I remember doing some yard word for Mrs. Mozel (<3). She was such a firecracker. Imagine this 80-year-old woman who answered the door in her nightgown and/or fancy QVC Sunday hat with a shotgun (unless your parents called her in advance of you coming). She was deaf as fuck, broke as fuck, snappy, her children were comparatively very wealthy but allowed her to live in poverty (or she more likely spent whatever stipends she had poorly). She taught me what an hourly wage meant, and I learned quite a bit that day. 

There are so few funerals that mattered to me over the years (PKs often have been to a billionty); I miss the image and idea of her. I wish I could go back in time and thank her for her kindness to some ignorant, brokeass boys. She showed me the world through her screen. She may be one of the fundamental forces in whatever literacy I have achieved.<<ref "c">> She was like a virtual mother to me, even if only via a storytelling drug and a handful of maturing interactions.
