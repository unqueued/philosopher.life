How's your week going?
SEP 5 11:30 AM
Hey [[h0p3]]! It’s been a busy week. Family drama going on too has me in the dumps.
SEP 5 11:33 AM
Class is great though. Started reading palace walk and it’s getting interesting 100 pages in. :’)
SEP 5 11:34 AM
I'm sorry. That is heavy.
SEP 5 11:34 AM
It's good you are still productive and able to put your mind into school too.
SEP 5 11:34 AM
It’s.... taxing. But I’ll survive.
SEP 5 11:35 AM
Mom kicked Chase out and I tore her a new one when she tried to justify it using the Bible.
SEP 5 11:35 AM
Ugh =(
SEP 5 11:36 AM
That is awful.
SEP 5 11:36 AM
That is the shit that keeps me up late into the morning.
SEP 5 11:37 AM
I can see why you are in the dumps.
SEP 5 11:37 AM
Yeah.... it’s been a depressing week. Learned this shit mid dnd session.
SEP 5 11:38 AM
So I had to adjust on the fly to finish strong too. :sweat:
SEP 5 11:39 AM
It sucked.
SEP 5 11:39 AM
I don't think I'd be able to continue D&D. Responsibilities of the story teller are exception in that kind of moment.
SEP 5 11:41 AM
We didn’t go but for twenty more minutes. It was a critical moment. :upside_down_face:
SEP 5 11:42 AM
Well, I hope Chase stays connected with you (and others in your family). It makes me it messy. He may not. You'd be a good ear for him.
SEP 5 11:43 AM
Also, Palace Walks looks to be an interesting. Walking through some summaries and reviews.
SEP 5 11:43 AM
Chase is 100% okay with his brothers. I know that. He just sucks at answering messages.
SEP 5 11:44 AM
Interesting is the right word.
SEP 5 11:44 AM
The first part of the book is more or less a showcase of the family and how they all interact together.
SEP 5 11:44 AM
Some of them are more interesting than others. The females really get the shaft as far as screen time. But I expected that.
SEP 5 11:45 AM
The last book I read (and it's been a while) set in that region was The Kite Runner.
SEP 5 11:47 AM
I cried many times in that book.
SEP 5 11:47 AM
Awe
SEP 5 11:53 AM
I’ve never had an emotional response from a book like that before.
SEP 5 11:53 AM
Hopefully one day. :)
