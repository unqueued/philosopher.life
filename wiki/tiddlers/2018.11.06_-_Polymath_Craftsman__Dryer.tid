Changed the fuse with my son today. We had fun doing it. I got to strip a wire to add a piece to put in the bottom part of the fuse. The instructions were awful, but it was clear what needed to be done from looking at it. I'm grateful to have had the tools and parts to do it. 

It's running again. We cleaned out everything we could. We can only put our arms into the wall so far. I need to call maintenance possibly. There is heat, but it's shitty. I think my wife is still going to be unhappy. I feel bad about that, even though I'm pleased to have it running at all.

Fuck. There's no heat on it again. I've been warned about this. Fuse is probably dead. =( This was a waste, except that it buys me information.
