* [[2019.06.28 - gh057: Wow!]]
** Hopefully, I hear from him in a week or two.
* [[2019.06.28 - gh057: Hows it going?]]
** I was floored by this letter. 
* [[gh057]]
** Welcome, sir! 
* [[2019.06.28 - Ovy: Hello!]]
** Our communications still seem very desynched to me, and I'm not sure why.
* [[2019.06.28 - Wiki Review: Paranoia]]
** Oh, I need to get back to [[Memetic Warfare]] sometime. That one may take years to grow, and that's okay. 
* [[2019.06.28 - TDL: Clean]]
** I'm spinning up 10k projects and completing only some. It's been a fucking whirlwind.
* [[2019.06.28 - Prompted Introspection: Loss]]
** Edited. Most of the world doesn't have this. I must fight for them.
* [[2019.06.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: RWing]]
** Completed. These have been some late nights.
* [[2019.06.28 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tyranny]]

** There are some hiccups in getting this to work and present correctly. We need it.
* [[2019.06.28 - Wiki Audit: FTO]]
** The overhaul isn't completely done, and I need to finish it off today.
* [[2019.06.28 - Ovy: What I use, info and another apprentice?]]
** I fear I won't be of sufficient use to [[Ovy]]. I'm gonna do what I can with what I have.
* [[Ovy]]
** It has been an explosive conversation!
