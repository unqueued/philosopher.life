* Thank you for the story river
* You posted nothing on the 22nd and 27th. 
* I think you should divide your work up into different sections. One for pictures, one for blog posts, one for analysis, etc.
* I love your footnotes.
* I laughed after I said that comment!
* Footnote aesthetics need some work, as well as scoping.
* Your introspection sucks. It's not even trying.
* Consider redoing your dates with a YYYY.MM.DD structure.
* Make it a point to write happy things on your blog each as well, not just the truth.
