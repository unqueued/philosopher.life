```
Hey sir. I am sure you guys are doing church today, but I haven't caught up with you.
9 HR AGO
=)
9 HR AGO
I haven't been a Christian in a long time: no church for me.
9 HR AGO
Wife and kids attend though.
9 HR AGO
I have been on a rampage of reconnecting with people who have inspired, made and impact, or I really enjoyed conversing with.
9 HR AGO
If your not a Christian what are you?
9 HR AGO
I just wanna make sure I see you in heaven. I'm a Christian in the sense it's like starting a small Roth IRA. It's there if you ever need it.
9 HR AGO
Hahahah
9 HR AGO
sorry, 10 things hit me at once
9 HR AGO
I adore that you are on that rampage!
9 HR AGO
Thanks! Catch up to/with me when you csn.
9 HR AGO
I would call myself a philosopher; I believe in the philosopher's god.
9 HR AGO
The Roth IRA sounds like a Chreaster (Christmas and Easter thing).
9 HR AGO
Once in a while I will attend.
9 HR AGO
It's a fairly emotional experience for me.
9 HR AGO
I'm kinda shocked.
9 HR AGO
Funny enough, I stopped believing in hell and heaven a bit after Berea.
9 HR AGO
Ah, yeah, me too!
9 HR AGO
My heart and mind won't allow me not to believe in Jesus.
9 HR AGO
It has been a rough transition.
9 HR AGO
Probabaly more rough for your wife?
9 HR AGO
Definitely very difficult for her.
9 HR AGO
We agree on almost everything except the authority of The Bible, the agency of God, the divinity of Christ.
9 HR AGO
Wow. We will. Have to table this
9 HR AGO
I cannot process this, this morning.
9 HR AGO
I still feel guilty for skipping church.
9 HR AGO
How have you guys been? I sent you a pic of a car in selling. Didn't know if yall needed a good reliable cheep car.
9 HR AGO
I'm sorry I'm taking forever to respond! That is not normally like me.
8 HR AGO
We've been good enough.
8 HR AGO
We have thought about that car, no doubt.
8 HR AGO
It's a high miles honda. I drive is 500 miles a week and have put nearly 40k on it in the last year. It has been well maintained. I did all the preventative maintence when I first got it.
8 HR AGO
I bought it after I totaled my 2 door honda as a kick car to replace my commuter.
8 HR AGO
Quick.
8 HR AGO
But I'm kinda done with it. 1500 is what I have in it.
8 HR AGO
Cool. We can't afford it right now, but if and when we can, I'll let you know.
8 HR AGO
That's cool. I would do payments man but that gets complicated with a used car.
8 HR AGO
Cause something breaks, no one's fault, but gotta spend money to fix that then can't make the payment... Blah.
8 HR AGO
Makes sense
8 HR AGO
Its worth about 2500. But I'm not trying to make money on it. Not yet at least.
8 HR AGO
When Kathy and I were young we always kept 3 vehicles. Cause one woukd always break down.
8 HR AGO
And that gave me time to fix it.
8 HR AGO
And since then we have always been that way.
8 HR AGO
Just bought her mom's suburban. So now we have a truck, a suburban, two cars, and my hot rod truck, and a 4x4 jeep project.
8 HR AGO
So we obviously don't need it.
8 HR AGO
Lol
8 HR AGO
You have a lot of vehicles.
8 HR AGO
We keep two vehicles, neither of which run very well. My live in walking distance of my wife's work though.
8 HR AGO
That helps tremendously.
8 HR AGO
These are choices you make. Like you said. Time with the kiddos and homeschooling is way more important than material possessions.
8 HR AGO
I'm slowly learning that
8 HR AGO
So, how has life been going for you?
8 HR AGO
Life is good for the most part. I hate myself for being an addict. But I can't seem to make sense of the world sober.
8 HR AGO
I have no room to talk there.
8 HR AGO
Canada legalized weed. And I'm waiting to see how that plays out in their Department if transportation.
8 HR AGO
I might fucking move to Canada.
8 HR AGO
lol
8 HR AGO
Weed is good for me.
8 HR AGO
And weed, and the ocossional Valium. Make my life easier to live.
8 HR AGO
But I can't smoke weed.
8 HR AGO
I can't drink cause I always overdo it
8 HR AGO
I currently take Kratom which has some downsides.
8 HR AGO
Weed is a lot better for you.
8 HR AGO
Indeed.
8 HR AGO
Kratom gave me food poisoning. I have a kilo just sitting there.
8 HR AGO
You might like this: https://philosopher.life/#Cannabutter%20Recipe:%5B%5BCannabutter%20Recipe%5D%5D
8 HR AGO
Agreed. I have a fat sack of some good weed always keep on hand.
8 HR AGO
I prefer edibles because they are so cheap. I've used the same ounce for over a year now.
8 HR AGO
I can't sacrifice $30 an hour,  secrete clearance, and the best job I've ever had to get high can I?
8 HR AGO
But when I'm high I play with my kid like make belive.
8 HR AGO
I'm always prepared to study for my tests now.
8 HR AGO
I pet my dogs more.
8 HR AGO
You mean fake urine?
8 HR AGO
aye
8 HR AGO
unless they hair/blood test you
8 HR AGO
Made DMT with my brother this week.
8 HR AGO
That's hard to be prepared for randoms at work.
8 HR AGO
Do you they escort you with no time in between?
8 HR AGO
We had our first random like two months ago. They did it on site and the woman entered the bathroom with them.
8 HR AGO
But I don't know if they went in the stall or used the urinal.
8 HR AGO
I don't wanna ask alot of questions and raise suspicion.
8 HR AGO
I have fake urine in my car. But the uncertainty causes anxiety.
8 HR AGO
Which negates the benifit.
8 HR AGO
I hear that.
8 HR AGO
You asked me how I was doing and I went on a bitch fest.
8 HR AGO
I am doing great as well as my family is. Samantha is busy as ever.
8 HR AGO
Job is going well, I couldn't ask for a better one. And wife's salon is rock solid.
8 HR AGO
Life is good.
8 HR AGO
My head gets it confused sometimes.
8 HR AGO
Hahahah
8 HR AGO
Why you making dmt?
8 HR AGO
Lol. Crazy ass.
8 HR AGO
I'm glad life is going well. I didn't know your wife had a salon.
8 HR AGO
I made DMT for pharmahuasca. I absolutely despise smoking, but I will try that as well sometime since it's apparently more vivid.
8 HR AGO
I had rootbark left, and my brother is a chef. He was interested in how it was made.
8 HR AGO
Used to grow shrooms, and I think they are significantly better than DMT+MAOI.
8 HR AGO
(and, I've never even tried MAOI with shrooms, which apparently enhances the experience further).
8 HR AGO
Psychedelics have been crucial to helping me deal with my depression.
7 HR AGO
I haven't taken one since March, and before that maybe 2 years.
7 HR AGO
Shrooms  are good. We use to pick them all morning just across the street from my best friends house. It was a cow field.
7 HR AGO
We made shrooms tea. Not a potent as homegrown. But in mass quantities will do plenty.
7 HR AGO
Aye, helps a bit with the nausea.
7 HR AGO
Assuming there is a next time, I will be going for an extraction.
7 HR AGO
I went on a two week shrrom trip back in HS. I stayed at my buddy's house and he babay sat me. Lol. It was a teenager hangout spot. I can't talk when I'm trippin hard. I get really reclusive and weird.
7 HR AGO
I went hard. But I'd rather do cocaine than shrooms again.
7 HR AGO
You must have a special non-tolerance buildup for psilocin. It takes most people 7 days to get back to base.
7 HR AGO
Been spending time connecting with people too.
7 HR AGO
It has been a time consuming process, but I'm glad to have the chance.
7 HR AGO
In the world of social medial. I'd rather have a private one on one with you than the other. We can't physically hang out. Proxcimety. But most of the other pals are all doing the same shit. At home with the kids. Bored. And trying to make time for their old hobbies and new ones.
7 HR AGO
I hear that.
7 HR AGO
The wiki has been my timesink.
7 HR AGO
Mine is all garage shit.
7 HR AGO
Installed a hitch on a neighbors suv yesturday and another one on my golf cart. Lol
7 HR AGO
lol
7 HR AGO
I've had good results with kratom. But from a local head shop. Very potent brand.
7 HR AGO
But never spouse with anyone who has done it like me.
7 HR AGO
Going on a year now. Approx 4 days a week.
7 HR AGO
I can't get signal to work on my pc.
7 HR AGO
nevermind. I got it linked up.
7 HR AGO
I will be curious to see if Kratom continues to be legal.
7 HR AGO
indeed. I think it is on its way out.
7 HR AGO
I know people who use it to drop opiate addiction
7 HR AGO
its sad. it really needs FDA approval as a supplement and to be regulated
7 HR AGO
i cant believe i just said something needs to be regulated
7 HR AGO
hehe
7 HR AGO
fucking shoot me.
7 HR AGO
/pew-pew
7 HR AGO
its needs better quality control.
7 HR AGO
the stuff i get is consistant and sealed.
7 HR AGO
ive bought other brands and they were crap.
7 HR AGO
Could grow your own
7 HR AGO
i keep my doses around 6-10grams and usually only dose once a day during the weekends.
7 HR AGO
i spend maybe $7 per dose. if i did the math.
7 HR AGO
i spend usually $10-$15 on crap at a gas station every day.
7 HR AGO
lol
7 HR AGO
it has really helped me with depression and anxiety.
7 HR AGO
but it has also helped me "get the edge off"  after a hard days work. or when ive been really stressed.
7 HR AGO
I'm glad kratom gives you relief. I hope it continues to be readily available to you.
7 HR AGO
i would prefer WEED!
7 HR AGO
and i would grow my own. lol
7 HR AGO
Bombardier aerospace is headquartered in Montreal. And i have experience working on those aircraft.
7 HR AGO
i could easily get a job their. i am not afraid to move so i can live without fear of something i have done since i was in middle school.
7 HR AGO
there*
7 HR AGO
I would take that option, provided I had it available.
7 HR AGO
um they have librarys and need welders in canada
7 HR AGO
we could be neighbors!
7 HR AGO
I'm not certified for welding, and Canada has their own certs for fitting.
7 HR AGO
Library positions are not easy to find either.
7 HR AGO
We have been looking though. =)
7 HR AGO
dont be a dream crusher.
7 HR AGO
lol
7 HR AGO
your kids homeschool my daughter.
7 HR AGO
bwahahaha
7 HR AGO
lol
7 HR AGO
I'm actually looking for a desk job, preferably remote.
7 HR AGO
Tutoring is on the list.
7 HR AGO
that would be excellent.
7 HR AGO
why dont you teach college via remote?
7 HR AGO
aye, working from home with the kids would be sick
7 HR AGO
go ahead and finish the phd.
7 HR AGO
Adjuncts get paid less than minimum wage
7 HR AGO
You get paid in status, which is irrelevant to me.
7 HR AGO
status?
7 HR AGO
how do you get less than minimum wage. when you like do almost nothing?
7 HR AGO
im confused.
7 HR AGO
lol
7 HR AGO
how are you calculating your hourly rate?
7 HR AGO
dont try so hard. it makes more $
7 HR AGO
lol
7 HR AGO
I've done a lot of different kinds of work. I don't think teachers do almost nothing, especially if they take it to be a moral imperative to do it right.
7 HR AGO
The vast majority of teachers in schools now are adjuncts, and they get are contract labor. They make ~$3k per class (this varies).
7 HR AGO
Even after being able to re-use lesson plans and careful consideration of limiting your grading, the hours add up very quickly.
7 HR AGO
Berea is an anomaly.
6 HR AGO
I think looking into teacher's jobs and their pay (at every level) would be an interesting exercise for you.
6 HR AGO
im making a movie about my dog
6 HR AGO
i will take your word for it.
6 HR AGO
lol, how's that going? =)
6 HR AGO
almost finished.
6 HR AGO
i have a 10 year old rescue that taught me so much. he literally is the best dog.
6 HR AGO
i think we all get that one animal in our life that stands out/ is amazing.
6 HR AGO
he is mine. no other dog will measure up.
6 HR AGO
we recently adopted another dog. that puts us at 4. i go no more that 4.
6 HR AGO
That's a lot of dogs.
6 HR AGO
i spend alot of time training my dogs to do the simple tasks that annoy people.
6 HR AGO
Like what? =)
6 HR AGO
we have ate thanksgiving dinner with a houseful of people and had 3 dogs in the house.
6 HR AGO
That is some excellent trolling
6 HR AGO
they just layed there.
6 HR AGO
we eat watching tv every night.
6 HR AGO
i know its terrible. but they dont beg, they know to go lay down or go eat themselves when we are eating.
6 HR AGO
my dog owen. can be walked without a leash.
6 HR AGO
can be called off a chase 95% of the time. and knows hand signals in case he ever goes deaf.
6 HR AGO
he isnt up your butt all the time wanted to be petted. I actually only pet my dogs a little bit.
6 HR AGO
im not constantly loving on my animals.
6 HR AGO
people who do that to me are weird.
6 HR AGO
in any event. my dogs dont jump on people/kids. they will exit a room when i tell them. will go lay down when i tell them, and will go outside to the fenced in yard when i tell them.
6 HR AGO
and sit. and come.
6 HR AGO
and thats all i expect out of them.
6 HR AGO
im not teaching my dog to jump through flaming hoops or anything. but a well behaved dog is a rare find in alot of animal lovers houses.
6 HR AGO
It sounds like you enjoy training dogs.
6 HR AGO
like as soon as you walk in their bull mastiff jumps on your kid like its ok.
6 HR AGO
we have one that is a "licker" and that is a difficult habit to stop. she will always do it. but making her stop continues to be a challenge.
6 HR AGO
so i tell all guest that they can use the command "no lick" and she obeys. but usually only for a short period.
6 HR AGO
lol
6 HR AGO
I had no idea you were a dog person.
6 HR AGO
i hate cats
6 HR AGO
though.
6 HR AGO
lol
6 HR AGO
barn cat i am cool with.
6 HR AGO
but an inside cat is a no go.
6 HR AGO
I hate dogs, hehe.
6 HR AGO
I had several growing up. My golden retriever was my favorite, by far.
6 HR AGO
I appreciate having a well-trained dogs, especially service dogs.
6 HR AGO
i dont like other peoples dogs.
6 HR AGO
if that makes sense.
6 HR AGO
or their kids*
6 HR AGO
lol
6 HR AGO
damn skippy.
6 HR AGO
hahah
6 HR AGO
but, then again, I don't like most humans, hehe
6 HR AGO
we can agree on that.
6 HR AGO
tried to send video, but it is too big to send here.
6 HR AGO
im uploading to youtube.
6 HR AGO
i used the pink floyd song from the album animals
6 HR AGO
when pigs fly
6 HR AGO
lol

5 HR AGO
Ah, I definitely like the higher resolution one more. Clean looking. =)
5 HR AGO
we adopted a dog while camping last weekend. a new one. the shelter was having a thing at the campground.
5 HR AGO
didnt plan on it but then ended up deciding on one.
5 HR AGO
the lady that ran the place got really weird. then upset we didnt have cash when signing paperwork.
5 HR AGO
then monday morning when my wife goes in she has called our vet and checked on all of our dogs and starts in on my wife about this dog was out on its parvo distemper shot and one was 2 weeks due on rabies and giving her greif.
5 HR AGO
my wife stood up for herself and told her to "your just going to have to get over  this"
5 HR AGO
she upset my wife enough she called me right after half in tears.
5 HR AGO
had it been a man i would have left work type of thing... but it was a girls spat.
5 HR AGO
i had been toying with ideas about what to say, or how to fuck with her. she questioned our ability to take care of the animal.
5 HR AGO
i immedetly took all 3 dogs to the vet the following day for checkups and get all their shots up to date.
5 HR AGO
she is an elected official so i thought about being a dick on social media.
5 HR AGO
but really i just wanted to make this lady feel sorry.
5 HR AGO
my vet even apologized for her when i told her how she handled it.
5 HR AGO
That is weird. I wonder what was going through her head.
5 HR AGO
so i created the most passive aggressive way to fuck with her head. a video promoting the humane society.
5 HR AGO
in which. all of my dogs, obviously, are spoiled rotten and that is not likely the case for alot of adoptions.
5 HR AGO
i see people go through dogs like they go through 2 liters of mnt dew...
5 HR AGO
i got mine tattooed on my side so he  will always be my right hand man. and go everywhere with me. "till i die nigga!"
5 HR AGO
lol
5 HR AGO
lol =)
5 HR AGO
sorry. i dont normally hold grudges. but when you upset my wife or my kid.... makes me do the hulk thing....
5 HR AGO
That is weirdest reason for making a humane society video I've ever heard. Lol.
5 HR AGO
kratom...
5 HR AGO
lol
5 HR AGO
boredom. and i like making videos
5 HR AGO
i have made several actually.
5 HR AGO
im too chicken shit to send the video  though.
5 HR AGO
so i will probably just show it to family and friends unless i get a good enough response.
5 HR AGO
