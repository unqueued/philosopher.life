title: 2018.12.27 - Wiki Audit: Printing

I was reminded today that we were printing the wiki at the end of the year. It turns out, I'm going to need to tailor it considerably. I prefer a monospace font, so I'll stick with what I have. We'll make a document with minimal margins and size 7ish(?) Zing, razor thin spacing, word-wrapped, and double-sided prints. It will probably have to be printed 100 sheets at a time. I'm fine with this archive requiring a magnifying lens or reading glasses.

[[Auto Text Expander]] is requiring practice and tuning. It doesn't always work either (as in tab refresh to fix fuckup)! This is annoying. I had to turn down the latency to 250ms. It's not making as many slipups now. If I use it in the search bar or fields, then fuck the brackets. So far, it is slowing me down. It's immensely useful for the [[hlexicon]] and several other things though (enough that this will be worth using). I am in absolute love with the cursor based [[Text Blaze]] tools. OMG. I'm not sure how I lived without this. Perhaps doing the inline footnotes like [[Sphygmus]] will be the way to go if I automatically render footnotes at the bottom of the tiddler with a macro? I need a firmcoding solution or bust.

Firmcoding is very close now. We've simply been stupid busy with other stuff. We will get back to it, and the wiki upgrades, and then back to the [[Search of h0p3]]. I still need to continue [[The Remodeling]].

I am feeling more lag in Chromium again. There are some tiny behavioral differences throwing me off my game, into the present-at-hand mode. I have not automated my understanding of this model well enough not to be surprised.
