title: 2019.07.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Mortal Equality

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
All mortals are equal; it is not their birth, but virtue itself that makes the difference.

Oof. This is a very hard problem to explain, and it's even more difficult to do so without ad hominem (which isn't conceptually wrong, of course). It is easy to dismiss people as eugenicists, eumemecists, fascists, prejudiced, dark-triadically self-centered, delusionally provincial, committing the anti-OOO differentiationist anthropocentric crime of elevating oneself above all other perspectives, and so on and so forth. Even Saint Oliver Sensen cannot give a sane account of difference in moral hierarchies.<<ref "i">>

Voltaire is attempting to capture a fundamental problem in moral philosophy. How can we say that we have equal beginnings and dignities of personhood while becoming unequal people through moral choices which define us? Clearly, we don't exactly have equal beginnings in some senses. We each start from different circumstances given our moral luck, but from a morally accountable perspective of personhood, we each have a blank slate, a flat starting place in which no one begins as a better person than any other (regardless of our morally arbitrary characteristics). Yes, some people have an easier time doing what is [[Right]], and insofar as it is easier, there is less merit to it. I am far more impressed by those who have to suffer to do what matters most. 

Put on your Virtue Theorist goggles, and it is easy to see that a flower dying in the sandy soil, with shade, few nutrients, and not enough water is not flourishing. It is not achieving the telos of its essence. Another flower which is flourishing is a better flower for the sake of the [[good]] of a flowerness decontextualized from circumstantial particulars. The same can be said of human specimens, but also for persons. 

Insofar as it is up to you, insofar as your personhood is doing all the identity work in the equation, not all mortals are equal. How you distinguish what kind of transworld identity you pick is what really defines your moral value. There may be infinite branches for all I know, but it is clear that some versions of my [[4DID]] are strictly and objectively better than others qua moral virtue (and not merely hedonic pleasure or even eudaimonic flourishing as a homo sapien).

Voltaire doesn't know what means to say well enough to specify it, but the gist is correct. Humans are not born in equal circumstances, and those circumstances dictate how difficult it is for them to be good people. Some people are better than others, and this calculation takes into account the moral difficulty of their contexts. Whatever is not moral luck is moral choice, and we are not equal on these grounds. Some lives are invalid in virtue of how they choose to live, and others valid only in virtue of how they choose to live.
