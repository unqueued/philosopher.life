title: 2019.07.20 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Faith and Reason

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Faith consists in believing what reason cannot.
<<<

Faith is the ground of all being for one's ability to reason (and even perceive) in a moment (though it can change), and it is that which targets the beginning and [[The End]]. It is a precursor to Reason. There are aspects of our faith which cannot be reasonably doubted, categories of our phenomenology which cannot be doubted without a skepticism that implodes or explodes everything in our perception. Reason can shape our faith. This is not a dialectic we can escape.

This is not what Voltaire has in mind, I assume. He generally aims to denigrate faith. This sentence does not have to be interpreted that way though.
