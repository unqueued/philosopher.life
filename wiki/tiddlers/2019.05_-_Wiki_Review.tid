!! Audit:

* Lots of pseudo-[[Prompted Introspection]] content embedded in here. I see tidbits of my flesh clinging to this skeleton all the time.
* There are also little messages sprinkled here and there.
* This has been an emotional month.
* I can tell when I'm feeling rushed or uninterested. I prefer the days when I have something real to say, even if it is only a wild tangent.
* I've started clustering "Edited" with the next line. 
* My son has done a good job with both hardware and software this month.
* Clearly, I have veered in a different direction with the wiki. I'm focused on other things (even though it also feels like I'm still spinning my wheels).
* The weekly [[FTO]] pulse continues to be useful. That formation showed up accidentally in a way, but it helps me think over larger stretches of time.
** I think [[FTO]] is also winding down a bit.
* [[h0p3's Log]] is rare. I'm glad! It's always a rough one.
* I wonder if [[DeathOfRobinhood]] will read the letter. I took a while on it. I'm getting bad about it.
* [[T-Money]] is hilarious. His own choice, ofc.
* I see the remnants of the letter to [[SLT]] in here.
* Gerome, Gerome, the Metronome. That's this log, alright. Andante, I take it. Keep it up, homie.
