Chit chat with Whitney. She's throwing a surpise party for her grandpa. It's sweet. I think he will be pleasantly surprised. She's unhappy about starting school back up on Monday. We talked about looking into her transfer to the state school; I think it will be valuable for her to start thinking about it now. It's coming up quickly for her.

5Jm is unhappy today. I am not quick to assign the ADHD label, but he fits. Some parts of school culture are not easy for him, understandably.  He seemed to feel better after talking with him and getting him something to eat.

I like that I'm beginning to know which foods which kids are going to eat. I give extra carrots to those who I know will eat them. The basketball players tend to eat their veggies.

6CM is drawing me a psychedelic Rick in sharpie. It is exquisite. She is an artist. She talked with me about wearing a mask. That girl is in a lot of pain. We talked about talking with ourselves, making spaces to be ourselves, and recognizing the necessity of responding to authority in particular ways.

7Jm and I continue to talk about coding. We talked about desensitizing usage of swearing, the utility of it, and the need for being able to code switch. We talked about what it means to be ourselves. Masking, again, became an important issue.

The lab has been good today. Those who want to bypass the firewall and surveillance do so with their phones. Don't let any adults catching you do that kiddos. When I am asked for permission, I repeat the rules carefully. 

These kids have a right to be pissed, and I need to help them be constructive with it.

5NP and I had a talk about entitlement and attitude. Some of his inferences are not appropriate. The boy does not like speaking eye to eye with me, understandably. They way he talks about Whitney just isn't acceptable.

Matt came in to yell at a few kids who were not on approved websites. His reactions to controlling 5NP were pretty extreme to me. It's been 2 years since Dorsey got in trouble for it. I see even the students of teachers who break the rule. I think this is being selectively wielded against particular students. 

I talked with the other teachers about the Troublemaker book to get their perspective. Delp wants corporeal punishment back (he dislikes most millennials, etc.). Matt appeared to flee. Whitney has no idea. Fair enough.

It was interesting to have so many kids gathered to just talk with the adults instead of playing in the gym. Neat.
