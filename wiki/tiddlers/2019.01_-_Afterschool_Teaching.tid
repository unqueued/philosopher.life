!! Audit:

* Holy fuck! That was a trip to read. My [[Employment]]-based log-projects tend to be. I remember these days clearly (perhaps to the point that I'm even confabulating...like when I've seen a picture of a something I also have memories of...).
* My first real month, lots of snowdays, I'm getting the hang of it just fine.
* I need a job that actually pays a living wage.
* I can see I won't be able to actually teach anything significant.
** Fuck me.
* I am grateful to [[AA]] yet again.
* It's been interesting to see this log come up in conversations.
* This is the kind of scaffolding I wish I had been doing the entire time.
** Well...wikis weren't always available. It's okay. You started out when you started out. Just do your best and fuck the rest.
* These kids make me so glad to have mine.
* This crisis of capitalism is so loud that it hurts.
* There are a few minor gems here and there.
* I don't feel like I'm kicking ass or fulfilling my potential, but this ends up happening in many of my jobs.
** I really do need to accept that not everything is up to me. Take the pain, but don't feel the blame except where appropriate.
