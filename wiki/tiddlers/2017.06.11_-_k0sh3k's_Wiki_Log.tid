title: 2017.06.11 - k0sh3k's Wiki Log

* This is the first week she has written in her wiki every day. In fact, she wrote two posts most days. I'm really grateful. I feel like we are in this together, and that we will both be good examples for our children. I think it will help us directly and indirectly in many ways, and mastering this practice will help our children master it as well.
* There was an introspective question which honestly had a serious answer. It was wise. I want to see more like that, of course, with her natural humor too.
* We talked about keeping a log of ILLs, recording and categorizing them. She needs to do science here to make her life easier, to do her job better, and because she is literally a scientist.
