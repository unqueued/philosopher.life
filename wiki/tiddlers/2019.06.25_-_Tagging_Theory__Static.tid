title: 2019.06.25 - Tagging Theory: Static

I prefer "static" to the term "ephemeral." Ephemerality is a particular kind of privacy relationship which I don't think my title.Dated tiddlers fully possess (and only because my reader would choose not to find it). I fight against ephemerality pretty strongly because I think it generates unnecessary [[ROG]]s (I find little moral value in that opaqueness except under cornercases); it's not the kind of privacy which I value (perhaps I'm wildy wrong somehow, as usual).

Static content just needs a [[title.Tag]] the vast majority of the time, but dynamic content (e.g [[Directories]]) actually benefit from tagging (and evolution in those relationships). Dynamic content doesn't know where it belongs, what it will be, what it ultimately for, the [[gfwiwcgws]] is undecided, and that means the relationships are meant to grow. 

Now, don't get me wrong, static content has elements of that as well, but somehow it isn't so pertinent to require the compute and attention that I hope to give [[directories]].
