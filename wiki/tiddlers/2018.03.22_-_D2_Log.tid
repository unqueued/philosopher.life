I'm pushing hard on necromancer for levels. I need level 92, and I'm hoping to pickup items along the way. I don't know if I want to make HOTO or not. It actually seems weaker on him than his wand for raw damage. I'm saving my ISTs for now, especially since I think the Death runeword is the highest raw physical damage item I can likely build.

The Merc is now a fucking beast. I hate to say it, but venom + 45% ias seems to be why I like Treachery, and 15% of the time, he's basically invincable. With 0WS Ghost Spear and 105 IAS (insane from 3 pieces), his jab and melee breakpoints are 9 and 10 respectively. Double life leech is outstanding. He's very offensive for very cheap.
