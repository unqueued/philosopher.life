title: 2019.08.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Deviation

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Deviation from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable.
<<<

The commodification of homo sapiens and the planet generates a regression toward the mean of what is useful for the centralization of power, human norms and conventions included. Anything which doesn't centralize power must be converted, quarantined, or eliminated. The quote is correct on a number of orders. We are livestock nudged, herded, coerced, and caged by the competent psychopaths nature and we have enabled to rule us. Our mass exploitation is the norm. Insofar as the infrastructures around us enable new forms of exploitation, apparent progress is made.

I am, of course, no luddite or anarchist who denies the necessity of the justified means to our ends. Practicing [[The Golden Rule]] becomes even more complicated when we recognize just how much the rest of [[Humanity]] owns us as individuals. We must sacrifice for each other. 

An exception I see to this sentence is that psychopathic deviance can be less exploitable, even though there are pyramids of wolves and sheep (and, yes, they become our managers, politicians, capitalists, etc.). The exploiters are deviants, and the most devious of the deviants are not always exploited or punished.
