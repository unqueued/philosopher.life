title: Meaningness: Why meaningness?

<<<
“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern.

Dimensions or modalities, or both? 

I take you to be talking about the postmodern project at large, and I think you are attempting to offer a metamodern interpretation of dealing with this problem. It's "going with the flow" of the rhizome. There is no outside-text, only frames of relativized reference inside some epistemic construct somehow linked to the external ontological structure around us (an assumption I'm going to take up, btw). My worry, of course, is that you have nothing but hyperreality here. You, of course, would accuse me of being confused about meaningness for some variant of denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. 

I suggest that the very sentences you write, the ideas you are arguing for, cannot be at the same time meaningful and meaningless in the same respect. You have no choice but to assume an objective fact of the matter to even dream up denying it in the first place. Of course, I am not wholly allergic to postmodernism as I used to be. I am indebted to those philosophers who came before and paved the pathway to see that transcendental gateway. 

Fixated pattern recognition and objective, external meaning seeking just is your existential plight.

Let me suggest that we likely agree to a great deal and that we simply have a disagreement for now about how to say it. 

It is easier to deconstruct than construct. It's entropy. I worry that you might expect moral realists to offer an account that is convincing to every 'rational' person, or you will throw it away and say it is impossible. I see it as a matter of faith in the objective, of course.

Meaningness is a hypertext book (in progress), plus a “metablog” that comments on it. The book begins with an appetizer. Alternatively, you might like to look at its table of cont

I found your work fascinating quite a while ago. In fact, the structure you are working with has served one of my inspirations for what I'm doing here in my wiki. Thank you.
