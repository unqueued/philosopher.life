!! Audit:

* `/salute` - This was a powerful experience for me. I've taught children before (ranges 4 to 60), but poor Appalachian kids hits my own childhood hard.
* I can't say I did a good job, and it was nothing like I anticipated. I walked into the job thinking it was one thing, being told it was another, then it was revealed what was expected (a profound difference between paper and reality), and finally I slowly learned how I could help them with what I had. Pragmatizing the ideal is always a fall from on high for me; call it pride, ignorance, and egoism.
* I haven't heard from The Janitor yet. It's up to him.
* It was fascinating to see Matt integrate into the system.
* I feel like I have profoundly failed those children, but I don't know what I can do either. Not everything is up to me. If the stars aligned, I could have been far more useful. I do not inspire.
** I can see they inspired me with my own children.
* Working with these the kids has been a great opportunity for me to think about my offspring's would be age-group peers. There are huge holes in my offspring's games, but there are places my children have been in the desert which those children will never experience too.
** I can see I fail to motivate everyone, lol.
* I'm grateful to have the chance to praise people. It's too uncommon. I wish I could just to be loving carebear rather than Plato's Guardian. Sumbitch enforcer, I tell ya what.
* There's a higher than 3% rate of people I tolerate in the building. That is magical!
* I'm glad I get in trouble for my children.
* I am honored to feed my children.
* To [[love]] those who will never know is the highlight of my work.
* It's a gutwrenching vocation. 
* I am grateful for the chance to homeschool. I know my children deserve a lot better than I can give them, but they get a lot more at home than they would at that school. If I can get them to write, I will not have failed them.
* I wish I got paid a living wage to do this.
