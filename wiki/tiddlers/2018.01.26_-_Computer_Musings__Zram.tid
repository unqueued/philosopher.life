title: 2018.01.26 - Computer Musings: Zram

I've never had much luck with Zram, but I'm considering trying it out again. It might just be worth it. RAM is very fucking expensive.<<ref "2019.03.23">>

Tried installing our 16GB RAM chip install my wife's laptop (Monster-12). Motherboard only reads up to 8...*Sigh. My wife may have to manage her memory more carefully.
