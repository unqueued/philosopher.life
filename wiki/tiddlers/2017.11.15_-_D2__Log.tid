Pushed zon to A5. I'm flabbergasted by how poor her damage is against some mobs. She has arguably the best AoE ability. It clears screens away from you accidentally sometimes. However, even with skill gear, I'm having to throw tons to even take a single mob down in A4. I'm so crazily reliant upon the merc to do the work for me. I'm pretty disappointed in it.

I don't mind her ability to take down single targets though. That has improved since I last played a Javazon. 

Chaos Sanctuary would be absolute cake, even with immunes, except that iron maiden is wrecking my merc. I need him still, particularly for immunes and extra fast. This last act is going to be rough. I'm worried that I can't handle the ancients. 

I think I'll use lower resist magic wand, drop a bunch of Full Rejuvi's on the ground, and reset them until no immune lightning. Worst comes to worst, I respec. I've never actually had to work that hard before, but I might in this case.
