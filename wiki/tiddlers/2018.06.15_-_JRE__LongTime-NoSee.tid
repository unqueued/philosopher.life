My brother and I talked about how his job was going. Sounds like they've been letting out early, but his body is still feeling it badly. He's feeling bad. I wish I knew how to help him. He's going to the doctor. I hope that will fix the physical problems enough for him to be able to focus on his existential crisis (although, I worry it is a detour, an attempt to avoid the crisis by just coasting through it with distractions, attending to hedonic pain/pleasure needs at the expense of the eudaimonic, etc.). I feel like my brother wants to miss the point of his own life.

We talked about my wiki, IJ, and writing a sci-fi novel. I made several arguments about why I'm convinced the wiki is still the worthy thing for me to pursue.
