I am going to try to clean this up. I feel like {[[About]]}, {[[Principles]]}, and {[[Focus]]} are already in non-trivial good shape, at least as evolving vessels. They have massive amounts of work put into them. No, they are still no where near where I want them to be.

{[[Vault]]} and {[[Dreams]]} are fucking awful. Of course, I'm not sure that {[[Focus]]} shouldn't just be focusing on what it does right now, namely itself.

PAY ATTENTION, SIR

Sometimes your standards are too high into [[irwartfrr]]-based failure! Make sure you love yourself enough that you hug your avatar without regret (smell the roses, homie; you are just a human). Do your best, but remember to temper your predictions and expectations. Be kind to yourself and others; you are [[fff]]. You have to point and charge, but remember that all generals make particular mistakes.<<ref "ex">>

I should offer to host signatures of content! DUH DOY!
