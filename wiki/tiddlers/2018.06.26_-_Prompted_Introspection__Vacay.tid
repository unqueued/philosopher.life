title: 2018.06.26 - Prompted Introspection: Vacay

!! What is the greatest vacation I have taken and what lessons can I take from it?

[[gfwiwcgws]] problems abound. I don't know. I can tell you that my notion of a vacation and my interpretation of the vacations I've been fortunate enough to go on have changed over the years. Believe me, I am a human who tries to take lessons from everything, including his vacations. That may be in part because of how I was raised.

This is complicated by the fact that MWF, my male donor, spent a great deal of time planning (it came to a crisis point during the vacation). He pushed us. I appreciate that we didn't have enough money for vacations that weren't educational, and yet I don't fully because they made the major Poisonwood Bible choices that ultimately forced 3rd world quality educations onto their impoverished children. As a philosopher, as a father, as a human being, I consider this an egregious sin against one's children and humanity.

The D.C. trip had so many effects in my life. I remember we were sitting outside the Smithsonian eating sandwiches, and we pointed out a homeless man (we weren't used to seeing homeless wander the streets as country boys, even though we had spent our earliest years in very poor neighborhoods in large cities). My donors decided to rush to give this man some of our food but couldn't find him. They decided he must have been "an angel." 

Were my donors delusional schizophrenics imposing their model onto the world? Did they really "see" that? Were they lying to us? Much rides upon how I interpret this event (and many like it). Ultimately, I'm convinced that either way, we are just incompatible.

Imagine the different views an autist and a schizophrenic would have. It's like they are arguing past each other in the Bayesian dialectic.
