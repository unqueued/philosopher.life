title: 2019.04.20 - Prompted Introspection: Unanswered

!! What is one unanswered question you would like to ask your parents? Why?

Lady Melisandre, I have a similar question before: [[2018.03.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Granddonor Question]]. That works for this question too. 

In this case, I'd prefer not to have contact at all. I do my duty on my wiki though. Part of me wonders, of course, how they might viably respond to [[2019.04.13 - SLT: TOU2]] (which is still in development at the time of writing this). Of course, I'm extremely doubtful of the veracity or validity of what they have to say, and I think they'll conveniently confabulate. I don't trust their answer at face value.
