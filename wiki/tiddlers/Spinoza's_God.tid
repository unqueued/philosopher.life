title: Spinoza's God

//Long have I felt a kinship with this man across the gulf of time. I am not an expert in his work, so now I'm going to have a deeper look.//

I believe that Spinoza's God is speaking to the reality revealing and self-creating nature of the transcendent itself. We are both interested in [[The Truth]] and [[The Good]] in its essence. He and I are crossing paths on the same scent-trail of the game we are hunting through the existential vortexes. I would desperately love to know what he, Kant, Plato, and Aristotle would think about this wiki, particularly [[The Categorical Imperative]]. =)

God is:

* impersonal, maximimally non-anthropomorphic
* quasi-scientific, indistinguishable from nature, reality, or existence itself
* transcendental
* cannot be individuated
* nothing can be conceived or exist except through God

It seems to me that [[The Good]] and everything else are distinguished by definition. I think there are things which aren't good, and thus I think there is something separate from [[The Good]]. Perhaps ontology and epistemology are parasitic upon [[The Good]]. Intellibility, at the very least, does seem parasitic. Existence is a harder pill to swallow. I'm not sure that is conceptually required. It would have a feeling of completeness if it did, but I am in no position to assert it with axiomatic certainty. Supervening upon and creating meaningful reality, yes, I agree to that. But, I suggest that the external world exists without Dasein, and it could be devoid of meaning outside of [[The Good]]. 

I do not see the necessity in a God animating reality, but I am open to the possibility, of course. A pure computational existence all the way down. It seems like there can be a gap though, and I am not sure why I must seal or should seal it. I agree to the epistemic claim that nothing can be conceived except through [[The Good]] (my God). However, I just don't know about exist. That seems to be far less clear to me.

Spinoza sings a happy tune, but I don't see why we should agree. I simply cannot assent to the idea that there is no opposite or contrary of [[The Good]]. Contraries seems obvious to me. Opposites less so, but it still seems plausible. Good and Being are different to me, and they aren't for Spinoza. Once you accept his conflation, it's easy to reach a complacency of spirit, that Nirvana state of the ultimate compatibilist. Unfortunately, that is a faith that I do not see the necessity in, especially since I distinguish [[The Good]] from good for, good given a particular standard, etc. Thus, the difference between [[The Right]] and [[The Good]] present a schism that prevents me from ever agreeing to the conflation of [[The Good]] and Being Itself. 

I'm willing to rise above the local concerns, and yet I do not see how Spinoza's vision of the eternal totality is accurate. In fact, the injections of stoicism in his view are so deep that I am suspicious. It is easy to confabulate to egoistic rationalizations of stoicism (the non-truisms of it). I think it is an incredibly convenient attitude towards the world. With such an attitude, "why" I should do anything disappears. I think it relativizes into nihilism. Spinoza's version of normativity is one of positive nihilism. His consoling pantheism remains incredibly weak and unsatisfying to my eyes. I appreciate the systematicity of it, and I can see how happiness can be achieved by it, but it engages in a banal oversimplification which ultimately I couldn't be happy with. I'd know it wasn't true.

Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of any of rationalist approaches to substance. They don't strike the right chord in me. I am convinced that metaphysics are real. I fear I cannot tell you much beyond that. Kant split my world in two harder than Descartes did. I can see, yet again, that Spinoza isn't right for me. I cannot take up these axioms; I'm forced into phenomenology that forces the primacy of epistemology over ontology because it's conceptually required. I recognize, of course, that is assbackwards in many peoples' views to be a phenomenologist with strong beliefs in metaphysics. I'm sorry to you as well. Thus, Spinoza has the wrong starting place.

I must think more about it.

I will say this. My ketamine dreams are Spinozistic worlds. No doubt, I see I am a cog or mode more than ever. To be stoic about it, of course, is to assent to the fact. In a way, it's a defeater of any problematic I could conceive. It doesn't matter what happens in a sense because it is definitionally good, whatever happens that is. Leibniz was sure of it too. I know these men are geniuses of geniuses. With respect, I disagree. 

Look, they really can't say I ought not be unhappy or unsatisfied with it if I end up doing it, since that is obviously the best of all possible worlds. I am concerned these men were so profoundly rationalist that they could not distinguish the determinist-appearing forest from the random-appearing trees. The empiricists saw it plainly before them. Kant was the one to rule them all. 

I can see that I feel my notion of freedom, however impossible appearing it is, is simply more valuable and meaningful than what the compatibilists have to offer. I have made a good faith effort to escape this deep intuition of mine, and I cannot. Even on the stoic's point of view, I should admit that I cannot change this about myself. Thus, I should not pursue stoicism, although I will gratefully borrow from it when I can. My escape of nihilism just isn't that simple.

No, I am back to [[The Categorical Imperative]] it seems. Hello, Lightness, my old friend.
