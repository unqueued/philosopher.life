A substance I use once a week, on Shabbat. It's not religious. It's not spiritual. Rather, it's existential. It's philosophical. My [[H-book]] cataloged it poorly (gnosticism engage!). No, but really, it allows a hunk of deterministic flesh (me) to see things differently every week. We need that rhythm of being awoken from our dogmatic slumber, from our perspective, to empathize with ourselves and outside ourselves. How often should we dissociate?<<ref "0">>

I don't know what to say. It's the tool that pulled me from unreality back to reality. It sliced the weight of my depression off me, and I could finally emerge. I'm still emerging; we always are! That doesn't mean we must keep pushing the button to dissociate. 

I respect the two-edgedness of the dissociative blade.<<ref "1">>

DCK allows me to shape this wiki (and myself), to reframe it, to inject, to cut, to weld, to
