* Chili sounds really good. 
** And, farts make me laugh, so I suppose it will sound hilarious too.
* Might need to buy le spackle.
** They've not posted anything on our doors, and it could be a while.
* Still feeling all over the place, stretched thin, 10k to do. Narrowing it down with some comfort wouldn't hurt.
* I'm excited to respond to Ivan
* I think I should end it with m16 =/
** You kept the packaging. Take some pix, package, ebay, try again.
* I presume inspection this week.
** Also, I take it from Delp's comment that he gave me an early inspection? He walked in at a time he liked and decided to make that count.
