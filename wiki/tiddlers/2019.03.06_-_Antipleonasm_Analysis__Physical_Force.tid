RED ALERT! Someone is trying to deny the conceptual possibility of "slavery with extra steps." If she is allowed to define slavery like this, she can exploit the other kinds freely. This is the danger of Libertarianism.

Slavery comes in degrees and kinds. I find most people don't take that nearly seriously enough.

I have been told by a few that my understanding of [[The Moral Law]] is itself slavery too, and not just by self-identifying egoists. My moral perfectionism is enriched to the point that I find little mere permissibility in the world; I see obligation almost everywhere. Casuistry and moral intuitions are profoundly limited, and virtuous perception is primarily improved through training. It's weird how I see so much possibility in the world, and that is what so obviously points in particular directions for me. I don't meet enough people who believe in possibility nearly enough.

The fact is that the girl drowning in the pool next to you temporarily owns you ([[The Moral Law]] enslaves you to her in that moment). She even has a right for me to enforce it. I have a moral obligation (she even owns me) to force you (let us say I have a remote that allows me physically hurt you from a distance) you to save that girl too. It is my moral duty to enforce moral duty to some [[dok]]. The retaliatory aspects of [[The Golden Rule]] aren't easy. Coercion is icky, ugly, too easily misused.

In any case, slavery is obviously far more expansive a concept. It's easy to see how Libertarian dystopias in capitalism generate basic structures and invisible bonds of slavery. We don't have to construct the world like this. The centralization of power enables the elite to radically alienate you from yourself and your labor: or you just starve. That's consent, right? Lol.
