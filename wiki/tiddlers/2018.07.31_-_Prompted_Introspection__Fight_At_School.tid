title: 2018.07.31 - Prompted Introspection: Fight At School

!! If you witnessed a fight at school would you report it? What could the repercussions be if you told the truth?

Currently, I would report it to the other authority, [[k0sh3k]]. Of course, I'm the principle. Uh, I'm more worried about not reporting the truth. The whole point is to be honest!

I did witness a fight as teacher with some poor young men (larger than me). I did not step in. I told them to stop. I think the other teachers were disappointed in me. Fuck 'em. 

I'm regularly the sort who reports when there is a moral requirement. I do not care about the social fallout when I'm acting from duty.
