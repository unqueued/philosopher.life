I think that accuracy in epistemology, being philosophical, is likely bimodally distributed at the very least (easily could be more complex). Like my logic classes, there are those students who are cut out for it, and those aren't. Most are not. Of those who are, there are varying degrees of competence, but it often has more to do with effort than raw talent. You have to want to do it well to reach the tip of that second hump.
