title: 2019.09.10 - JRE: Doing Well

My brother said he is doing well. Wow. Sick. This is excellent. It's not like he doesn't have a fuckton going on, a whirlwind, difficulties with Rebecca and his baby, work, etc. He seems to be okay with it though, handling it constructively, perhaps comfortable-ish even. He deserves that stability and feeling of doing at least alright.

Second opinion plumber saw that it really was a terrible situation for him. My brother already did most of the labor of the first bid, but the surprises he can't do. Not having a sink in the bathroom sucks with a baby.

Rebecca is okayish. My brother is very attuned to her moods. She is one of the most quiet people I've met, and he picks out the [[salience]]. He cleaned up the basement for her. He is resigned to collecting tools; I think he has a tiny baby in his house, and it's a miracle he has any freetime.

We talked WoW-shop. He's gonna get a hunter spec here. It should be strong for PvP and PvE, and I'm sure he'll find a good balance. I'm gonna bet he'll give up on his melee DPS spec. Here's dat spec, yo:

My brother is hilarious with his apprentices. He steps in to defend and protect them often. But, he knows when to troll too, lol. He keeps calling himself a bully, and that's disconcerting. I see maybe 20% truth in that; he goes pretty hard sometimes, and I'm sure he's thrilling at work. Yet, that's just not who I see in him. I'm gonna keep thinking about it because he keeps saying it.

I didn't hear word back about the CT scan, so it is likely nothing at all. =)
