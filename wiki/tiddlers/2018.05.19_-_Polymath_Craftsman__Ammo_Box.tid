title: 2018.05.19 - Polymath Craftsman: Ammo Box

Bought another ammo box. It seems to do what I want well enough. I think it will last for a long time too.

The trip to Harbor Freight I took was primarily for my son though. We picked up a variety of tools that he is missing for woodworking. To talked about some of the tools. He guided me on what he needed most of the time.
