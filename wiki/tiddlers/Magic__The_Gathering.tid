!! About:

I have my 10,000 hours in this game. I won a SCG 5k and went second day at their annual tournament (I don't play standard). I have an excellent record against professional players in competitive play. Overall, I actually made money playing magic, though it is clear to me that the opportunity costs were ridiculously high. I wish I spent my time on something else.

Magic is burned into my brain, but I'm beyond rusty. I'm teaching my children how to play. I hope it is something we can do together for many decades to come. There are very few board games I enjoy playing. I don't play competitively anymore, but I like to screw around once in a while. I keep a mounted uncut sheet of foil Eldrazi commons as a trophy in my living room.
