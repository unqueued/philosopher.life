title: 2019.07.08 - JRE: Stranger Things

My brother called me up. I think my offspring are entertaining and annoying him some, like normal kids he says. My son has made him laugh (which my wife predicted).

He's wrestled with my offspring a bit. My daughter's acid tongue is over the top for him. Some of the things she gets away with saying to me and to her uncle we'd have been beat for saying to our own donors. It must be an odd thing for him to take in. I will be interested to see if she interprets the contexts appropriately; I would be surprised if she were disrespectful toward Rebecca (she does make mistakes though). He is thinking about the ways in which they push boundaries. It's interesting because they are all off of work, lol. 

They are playing on his VR and not working with him in the basement. 

My brother is concerned about his hammerdrill acquisition. It's been weighing on him. I will keep thinking about it too.

We talked about Stranger Things, Veep, and Venture Bros. He said he is skilled at picking out shows, and I am skilled at judging them. I think we make a good team. They are watching Stranger Things at their place.

My brother took the offspring to a trampoline park, and he slept. He didn't sleep well at all last night. He is worried that my son's back has been hurting.
