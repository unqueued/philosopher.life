title: 2019.08.14 - TDL: Transitions

* We need to prep for the possibility we will be moving in 6 weeks.
* Need to setup VMs, kernel headers, and prep.
* I'm excited by the n52. Delicious. Enjoy, sir.
* Dirty rice sounds good. Fruits and veggies.
* Offspring still have a lot of computing set up to do. The transition is going very slowly (but, it isn't all up to me now).
