Odd. The strong Platonism just is the universal, all encompassing, real theory. It's his real work. I see weak Platonism as giving us relativized contextualism. The shift from local to global, the dialectic, the emerging ultimate sublator of infinity, etc, these still give us Henosis. 

Yet another set of footnotes and interpretations. My wiki is the same.
