!! About:

//My daughter, Saint Alia of the Knife.//

The world is her oyster. She has the tools to acquire the tools. She is filled with potential. If she works hard, keeps it up, and if she plans carefully, she could be quite happy. I'm here to help her do exactly that.

You have seen and understood much for your age. What will you do with it? Take more risks.<<ref "1">> Do not be afraid to make mistakes in your art. Push.

* [[Our Daughter: The Designer of Happiness]]

!! Principles:

My daughter sits on the cusp of being autonomous. Sometimes, she takes charge of her life, and other times, she does not. I am doing my best to help her take control of her life. I want her to be happy.<<ref "2">> Give her ideas, give her resources to make her life better, encourage her, and help her love herself.

For now, my goal is to teach her to be a designer of everything. To see the objects, structures, and patterns emerge from the world, and to manipulate, use, and enjoy them for what they are. She has the gifts. I must preserve the humanities for her because, ultimately, these are the most important concerns. I have to guide her autonomy.

I will do this by trying to be a good example to her, to show her what it means to design her own happiness. I'm going to need her help, and in helping me, she becomes a truly gifted designer. My daughter is going to build things for me; she will grow to understand the entire process from start to finish.
