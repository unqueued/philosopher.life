Not enough people are worried about this exact problem.

 we should perhaps conceive of consciousness as a negative phenomenon, as something that arises from what the brain is specifically unable to do. Namely, as a self-referential computational system, the brain is unable to completely and independently represent its own states within itself. What this means is that its activity will always have a dimension that is irreducible and hence indivisible and unitary, which in turn corresponds to the conscious self.

That sounds like a problem of qualia, of de se/de re, of "what it's like to be." The question for me is "irreducible" to whom? That I cannot reduce my own experience for myself, yes. But, that it is representable by sufficiently powerful virtual machine hosts, that's fine.
