*** I will never understand why people think Socialism is inextricably linked to centralized planning nor the centralization of power itself, since Socialism, to my eyes, is definitionally not that. More importantly, I think practical computer science points out the very realistic possibility of decentralizing these political, economic, and technical structures (even if it is difficult to do). There is common ground for the market-apostle and the socialist, but that's because Capitalist's don't have a conceptual monopoly over markets. Some Marxists would vehemently disagree. I appreciate the paranoia.
