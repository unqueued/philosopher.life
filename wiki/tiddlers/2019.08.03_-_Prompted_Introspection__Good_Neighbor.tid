title: 2019.08.03 - Prompted Introspection: Good Neighbor

!! What makes a good neighbor?

Ha, I adore my smartass answer in [[2018.03.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Good Neighbor]]. The [[gfwiwcgws]] of neighborliness ranges, but the ultimate [[good]] is [[The Good]] (that unified thingiest thing). Welp. [[Good]]will is the only answer. Of course, it is practicing [[The Golden Rule]]. [[The Right]] is always the answer for we moral agents.
