title: 2018.10.29 - Conceiving About The Inconceivable: Necessity

I don't know how to reason about necessary agents, except hypotheticalizing their freedom. Since 'ought implies can' and they can't do otherwise, then I don't know see how they are moral agents. It appears the core of [[The Good]] (and thus everything in it, and worryingly maybe everything else) is necessary; I cannot conceive of [[The Right]] for/of [[The Good]]. [[The Right]] exists in virtue of contingency.

One of my major moves in philosophy is that I think contingency can arise from necessity. What follows from what is necessary is not necessarily necessary, right? Sounds like we lose truth-preservation. GÃ¶del and Spinoza are coming to pummel me. My best out is that you cannot have certainty by definition, since to secure that would be to necessitate everything. But, once you stop pursuing certainty and seek confidence, i.e. faith, then you are not contradicting yourself to accept my major move.
