I am sorry that I attacked the way in which you engage in the dialectic and truth-seeking. That is not where I meant the conversation to go (although, I'm ultimately glad we did). You seek the truth, and I very much admire that about you. I need to take a page out of your book and do it more as you do. You definitely correct me and others with your style, and I appreciate that you have the integrity to do so.<<ref "1">>

Forgive me for not immediately recognizing your philosophical pursuit.<<ref "2">> Over the course of the conversation, it became even clearer to me that, in a way, it was the pot calling the kettle black; turnabout is fair play. I don't spend enough time using your method. Thank you for pointing this out. 

As another example, I like that you ask me for particular cases and evidence. Sometimes I can't come up with them and we ride my virtue-theoretic fastmind inferences. But, it keeps me looking. Later, I analyze it. I search for examples. I may have sufficient reasons, but they are too private and not public enough. Sometimes I don't have what I thought I did. Your honesty helps me be honest with myself; thank you.

You engage in that maxim:

<<<
Strangers deserve my courtesy; friends deserve my honesty.
<<<

Thank you for your honesty. I very much treasure it. You have a measured approach that I don't sometimes. Please give me time to mimic, understand, appreciate, and engage the dialectic more like you.

Thank you for being kind to a man who infuriatingly always thinks he rights; it's like talking to a wall. You are a kind sledgehammer for a wrestling wall.

<<footnotes "1" "It is the similar integrity of telling an apprentice in front of everyone that he doesn't need to do that stupid thing. You spend your social capital to help him. Friends spend their social capital with each other help each other sometimes. You do that with me all the time. I'm very lucky to have you help me in this way. Thank you.">>

<<footnotes "2" "I will always be convinced that you are a philosopher. You do philosophy differently than I do, and that's okay! I have learned so much from you over the years. Thank you!">>
