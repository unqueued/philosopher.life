title: 2018.10.27 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

We consistently see direct assertions of loyalty to Dumbledore. What does Dumbledore represent?

Lots of affective and behavioral explanations of dark-triadicism in the history of Voldemort.

Finally at Horcruxes! I love how the Pensieve with a tampered memory is what illuminates it. The worry is that I will lack integrity in how I manipulate my own memory.

Dumbledore uses people.

Shortcuts are a two-edged sword. Principle, Prince.

I am annoyed by how little they learn of the muggle world which appears universal. They need some muggle learning too.

How is the "love" potion not outlawed?

Drinking minors was always fun for me.

It seems to me that Voldemort's rise to power is much slower than it should been given his ambition and talent.
