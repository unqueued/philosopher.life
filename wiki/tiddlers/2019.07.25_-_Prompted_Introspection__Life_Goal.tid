title: 2019.07.25 - Prompted Introspection: Life Goal

!! What is one of your life goals?

{[[Dreams]]} and [[Lifetime Projects]] have some answers. Today, I'm thinking about [[Outopos]] in [[2019.07.25 - Outopos: Ghetto]]. I've not tried going this route enough, but we've been dreaming about it for long time. I see it in several places in [[Computing]]. I'd like to participate on a functioning P2P network in which the workers own the means of digital production. It hits a lot of spots for me. Building meaningful social networks is a hard problem. I don't think I'm doing a great job, but that's okay. I need more time.
