title: 2019.08.11 - Prompted Introspection: Happy Family

!! What do you think makes a happy family?

Yes, Morty Bot, tell me. =)

Hedonically and egoistically, it's about having exploitatively centralized power and drained the resources from everything and everyone else in the world to lead the kind of lives you wish to lead while ribbonfarm-esque clutch lying to yourselves that you are a [[good]] person doing the [[right]] thing (or denying such moral realism where convenient). From there, you live in [[experience machines|Cypher's Choice]], drugged out of your mind, blinded to the truth insofar as it makes you happy. Coordinate a cartel of related oligarchs together, and you have a hedonically happy family.

Oh, you mean //eudaimonia//! Sorry, I didn't know what you meant. One must understand [[The Telos]] as wisely as possible to engage in the refective equilibrium necessary for generating the fitting balance in contradictory goals and obligations between individuals and collectives [[irwartfrr]] based on recursive applications of [[The Golden Rule]]. [[TOP]] applies to a group of any size, and it even applies an individual person's distinctive selves, aspects, or parts of their brain which have to be integrated and constituted by governing principles. What makes eudaimonically happy families is the result of understanding that, all else being equal, justification ought to trump hedonia prima facie given our vicious egoistic virtue-theoretic inclinations. Eudaimonia without justification is still hedonic flourishing, but moral merit has primacy, and hence there are limits in each particularized contexted to the [[dok]] eudaimonia is hedonically valuable to an individual or collective.
