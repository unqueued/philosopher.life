title: 2018.04.27 - Polymath Craftsman: Boss

Called boss up, Colton Dunham. He was on vacation, and he didn't know anything about what, where, or when either. I told him to text me when he found out. He called me "brother." I take this as a signal, but I remain cautious. 11:00 on Monday. Yay!

Helped my son construct his woodworking shop. I'm looking forward to seeing him dive into it.
