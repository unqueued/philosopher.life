title: 2019.02.18 - Be A Good Dad: Limerence

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

Started with a discussion of NFS+fstab and doing our work. 

I'm relying upon my offspring to help me construct the list of topics we rabbitholed.

Limerence, Mere Attraction, Virtue-Signaling, Love, Commitment, Frankfurtian Autonomy, rational and emotional dialectical balance, non-cognitivism, kindness in wrestling, definitions of Hegel's dialectic, the structure of empiricism and faith, and more.
