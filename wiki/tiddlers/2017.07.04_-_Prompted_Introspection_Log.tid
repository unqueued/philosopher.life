!! Cats or dogs. What kind of person are you, and why?

I'm not much of an animal person in general. I do like my cats though. I've had pets of different kinds. Cats fit me the best, although aquatic creatures have their own beautiful world that fascinates me.

Obviously, cats are more independent than dogs. They can take care of themselves in some important ways, and I like their personalities often enough. I find the logistics far more to my liking.

I like petting cats more. We stay around each other when we want, and otherwise, we leave each other alone. I find it much easier to empathize with a cat.

I've met some excellent dogs in my life (Golden Retrievers have been among the best dogs I've ever had the pleasure of meeting), but the vast majority are not very good creatures, imho. That, I assume, is largely due to the kinds of people who own dogs and the conditioning they give to their pets. I legitimately think that dog-owners tend to be, on average, less ethical, intelligent, and wise than the cat-owners I know. There are, of course, exceptions. Again, I'm talking about the //average// here.

If someone loves dogs, it is a strong indicator to me that I will not like them. It's a red flag. That might sound silly or ridiculous at first. It is a pattern I have noticed though. Dog-owners strongly tend to need their pet to love them, they are devoted to the pack mentality, and they conform to social conventions without appropriate introspection, pause, or critical reasoning. I consider their way of thinking dangerous. 

I think dog-owners tend to be "crazy" pet owners far more often than "cat" owners as well. 

As shocking as it may sound, the moral fabric of our lives are detailed. Even small choices, desires, and beliefs matter. They define who we are, what we think, and what we do. Being an X-person is still constitutive of who you are. It is quite likely (overwhelmingly, in my view) this a moral issue. I'm betting you disagree, Samwise. That's because you are a retarded dog-lover, aren't you? Good boy. Go fetch the stick, idiot.
