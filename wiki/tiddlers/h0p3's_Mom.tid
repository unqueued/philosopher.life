title: h0p3's Mom

* Where she's from:
** Born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. 
** She lived in a fairly middle-upperclass household (at least as we might concieve of it in today's economy). 
** Her father was a banker/manager/digital architect, and I take it her mother was more of a homemaker of sorts.
** Her father is a sociopath, and her mother is mentally disturbed (her husband's gaslighting and psychopathic behavior probably didn't help her). 
*** The Thomas side (my mother's mother's father's side) was pretty rough; lots of alcoholism, etc. 
*** The Dark Triad is strong on my mother's side. I've seen it in most of her relatives.
** When I see Madmen, I think somewhat of my mother's family and upbringing; my mother's was even darker though.
** Her parents treated her very poorly and likely viewed her as a piece of furniture for social events.
** She was an only child.
** A cataclysm in her life is the divorce between her parents (perhaps more scandalous back then).
*** This seemed to set off a chain reaction. Her mother attempted to commit suicide.
*** Eventually, my mother had herself emancipated since it was obvious that neither parent could or would care for her.
*** My mother's grandma (I call her Great Grandma Bubbles, but many called her Betty) took my mother in. She was my mother's parent.
** Eventually, she moved to Chicago to attend Moody Bible Institute, met my father. They got married.
*** Famous story in my family goes: at the wedding, my grandfather handed them a check for $1k and said to never ask for anything ever again.

* Psychology
** My mother is quite knowledgeable and very intelligent. She's a very systematic thinker who relies heavily upon her intuitions.
*** Her quantiative skills are quite poor (which makes her feel bad). Despite significant effort, her ability to understand certain classes of formal abstractions is quite poor. 
*** She reads a fuckton. She reads a wide variety. She follows trends in popular thought. 
** Is interested in Human Resources (one of her PhD programs focused HR Development). 
** Colorbind (quite rare among females), and this difference in perceptions has had impact, I believe.
** She has the impracticality of taking up too many projects. She does her best to organize (almost obsessively).
** She is a true workaholic down to the bone. She loves her work. It's why she lives.
** She definitely has the psychopathic switch in her, and she is aware of it. She clearly fights it though. 
*** INTJ's tend to be psychopaths or high-functioning autistic people. Essentially, they don't empathize in standard ways. INTJs are social deviants (I mean this scientifically, and without negative connotation). My mother is not autistic, hence her natural low-empathy state is likely psychopathic. This is in line with her genetics and her upbringing. Let us be clear, of course, that I'm not saying she is a bad woman. She legitimately attempts to empathize as much as she can. 
**** Psychopaths tend to study human psychology quite a bit. Successful ones, at least. It is part of blending and control. And, she is a control freak, no doubt.
**** Psychopaths, of course, can empathize. I do see my mother attempt to flip the switch on. Much of what I've learned about the nature of empathy comes from her (it's weird to say that I've learned empathy from a psychopath, I realize).
** Terrible migraines, and even worse sleep patterns. She ran on just a couple hours a sleep a night for years. 
*** Our lives would have been very different if they entered the ministry differently. They had to be workaholics to have a chance of succeeding at it from the angle they took.





* Religion


** Her conversion occurred in tweens/teens.
