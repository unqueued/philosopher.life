title: 2018.02.12 - Carpe Diem Log: Niece

* Woke at 9:30
* Network connectivity problem on the chromebook upstairs.
** Thank goodness for my imagination!
* Fireman Time!
* Kids working on kitchen
* Read+Write
** Worked more the [[The Categorical Imperative]]
* Talked to JRE
** He's still hanging in there. I should give him time to think about it before calling him again.
* Clean house
* Kitchen organized
* Talked to MB
** I'm now fairly convinced L is ghosting me after speaking with her MB about it. Malice or ignorance, I am not sure. But, I will have a measured response if and when I have the chance to speak her again.
*** I am reminded of how she treats my brother AIR, which I consider a huge mistake on her part.
* Bliss
* Went to the store with my wife to pick up cake and cookies
* Indian Food
* Our 2nd old niece came over.
** It was a brief visit. No idea what she thought of it. I'm glad we got together though.
* Regular Show, The Wire.
* Fireman Time, bed by 1ish. Slept off and on!
