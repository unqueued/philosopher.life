title: 2018.11.06 - Computer Musings: Son

My son has screwed up his machine (and has known it for quite a while) and he's not done jackshit that I've asked him to do. Several simple things have not been accomplished in months. It's pretty infuriating. I'm setting it up for him; I'm tired of wiping his ass. Back to XFCE and the basics. I swear I have to do this for him every month or two. It's ridiculous.
