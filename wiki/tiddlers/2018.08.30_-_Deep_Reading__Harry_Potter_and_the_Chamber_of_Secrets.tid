title: 2018.08.30 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

I like how the "m" word points to a disability that is actually so obviously an ability. We are tribal, otherising, scared of things we don't understand, fearful of that which can overpower us, etc.

The initial aspects of the book are truly lonely, miserable, and sets us up to want the absolute best for HP. We want magic to touch his life.

We also see him wield it vindictively (or worse) towards Dud.

Dobby might not be a fun character, but I'm very glad he's there. Dumb as it sounds, he might be one of the fundamental examples of a slave in the minds of a non-trivial percentage of the 1st world populace. Not enough people reason about the issue.

Of course, the underage magic bullshit annoyed me. I still feel it, lol.

The escape is wonderful. Who doesn't need that from time to time in their lives?

I absolutely adore how fucking punk this can be. Questioning authority is built in. I can't say I love everything Rowling does, but I'm grateful she gave this memeplex to kids everywhere.

This was a book that made it clear to me what family really means. I hope not to fail my own children in this regard.

Gnomes are whimsy. She weaves serious content with whimsy. It's got a nice pacing.

I am still moved by the gratitude expressed in these books. The love is still real. God damnit, I'm already fucking tearing up. 

Of course, the buying of school supplies is a special time for those of us that loved school. You know, my children don't get to experience that. I wish I could put myself into their shoes more effectively on this front.

Capitalism is calling, hello. Racism and reactionary bullshit abounds too.

Also, the "Dark Lord" reminds me of the kinds of coding allowed in different social contexts. I think this could have been taken much further. The weak Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis and a number of power dynamics should be given examples. 

I love how much she shits on media and motivations of those who distribute information.

Classism here is wonderfully presented; I really do hate so many fucking characters. My blood is boiling, and I'm reading a fucking children's book (maybe I'm still a child, lol). The emotional neural pathways of this book are still deep in me.
