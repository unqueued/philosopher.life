Set cronjob on restarting deluge. I don't have time to worry about it now.

---

I'm not worried about SSHFS for now. Killed the Fstab entries.

---

Cleaning up Ubuntu VM environment. Guest utils installed. Headless. SSH key setup. Autostart. I don't have it automounting, but I have the script for it.

Sadly, failed to cross compile vpncloud.rs in ubuntu as well. No go, for now.

Tried compiling on the RPI. It's something to do with the C embedded in it. I think that is the stopping point.
