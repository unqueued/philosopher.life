title: 2013.02.13 - Kant: Respect for Persons

We’ve briefly discussed this before, but I think it is worth mentioning again, particularly since Kant is so explicit about the topic in our reading: if the CI holds for all rational beings (persons), and if we must treat rational beings as ends in themselves, then I think the Kantian must seek out definitive evidence about whether or not other non-human animals are rational and not merely ruled by instinct (as a top priority). I don’t think any non-human animal generally receives the sort of treatment that Kant expects rational beings to receive. If we were to one day find out that some non-human animal species were rational enough to qualify as rational beings on the Kantian view, then we would likely be guilty of not treating them as ends. It seems to me that this issue calls for Kantians to carefully consider whether anything (AI) or being which may be rational. What should we do if we don’t know and what should we do if we have doubts? Should we cast a hedge of protection around such beings, artificially assuming they are rational just in case we might possibly find out later that they are in fact rational? It is akin to the concept of ‘innocent until proven guilty otherwise’ – a being is rational until proven otherwise, else we may make grave errors.


Also, on a related topic, I wonder how Kant views very young humans, including unborn humans. In particular, it seems like Kant has a hard time demonstrating why these are persons with rights associated with persons.


What is the relationship between “a person as an end” and “the Good?” Does personhood compete with the “good will” in terms of moral status? It shouldn’t, I assume, but I don’t see how it doesn’t. What does it mean to serve “merely as a means?” By “merely” he is pointing out that we can use ourselves or other people as a means to another end, but only when we also regard them as an end, right? This needs to be explained pretty explicitly, I think. So, for example, how does a Kantian understand recreational, non-procreative sex? How does Kant explain war or prison? It seems like there are a lot of cases where people might be regarded as a means but not an end which are favored by intuitions.

Let me preface this by saying that I believe I’m sympathetic to the goals in this passage, I’m just not sure how it works in the end. What does it mean to serve “merely as a means?” By “merely” he is pointing out that we can use ourselves or other people as a means to another end, but only when we also regard them as an end, right? This needs to be explained pretty explicitly, I think. So, for example, how does a Kantian understand recreational, non-procreative sex? How does Kant explain war or prison? It seems like there are a lot of cases where people might be regarded as a means but not an end which seem relevant to society.

Korsgaard: Kant’s Formula of Humanity


“humanity is the appropriate material for a rational principle, just as universality is its appropriate form.”
