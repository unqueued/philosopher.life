So I’ve been giving it a lot of thought and I’m truly stumped. Kickscondor is someone else you know right? I truly can’t tell. :joy:

I can tell you he is a skilled computer user, and if his goal were to be radically deceptive, he technically could. I don't think he has any interest in gas-lighting. There is a non-trivial chance he will read these words (or even search for them sometime in the future).

I would say I know [[kicks]] better than most who know his avatar ([[Sphygmus]] may know him better; I simply don't know).

I've never met kicks IRL. At the moment, we are penpalling across our sites.

I think what we're doing might be considered hyperrealistic roleplaying. Regardless, he is as real as one gets to me.

That’s really cool.

It almost appears like he’s a kindred spirit for you.

That he is. =)
