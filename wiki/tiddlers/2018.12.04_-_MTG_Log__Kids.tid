title: 2018.12.04 - MTG Log: Kids

Kids played magic with me. I wanted to try the new goblins deck. My daughter played her affinity and my son a GW weenie equip deck. It was shooting fish in a barrel. The token approach is hilarious! I feel like all the pieces I wanted just fell into my lap though. I don't know what a terrible hand looks like (though I did mull in my daughter's game).

I'm gonna have to tone it down dramatically. Even Legacy Highlander is still too strong, I fear. I wish they'd try the cookie-cutter decks to have an idea of what is happening.
