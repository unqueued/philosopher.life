Video of me attempting an original song.
JAN 5 12:58 PM
Cool. =)
JAN 5 1:02 PM
That guitar looks brand spankin' new (or keep it preserved carefully).
JAN 5 1:03 PM
Singing is a challenge. And playing and singing is new to me. I can carry a mean rift when I'm not attempting to sing. Lol. Yeah. I bought two new guitars and a new amp over the holiday season.

JAN 5 1:05 PM
And when I don't try to sing. - not my new guitar though.
JAN 5 1:05 PM
I saw your new electric.
JAN 5 1:06 PM
I'm a fan of acoustic.
JAN 5 1:06 PM
I like them all. From rap music to classical. And everything in between.
JAN 5 1:06 PM
I'm on the hunt for new methods of curating music (curating curators).
JAN 5 1:11 PM
I can enjoy listening to a wide variety, but I'm trying to grow a minimal collection of songs I'd want to listen to all day erry day.
JAN 5 1:12 PM
What do you mean by curating music?
JAN 5 1:14 PM
Do you mean teaching the kiddos?
JAN 5 1:16 PM
Haven't given it another "once over" in a while (but I will soon enough): https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library:%5B%5BMusic%3A%20Library%5D%5D
JAN 5 1:16 PM
trying to build that thing
JAN 5 1:17 PM
Kids and I have moved away from music. Teaching them Magic instead (been super useful); https://philosopher.life/#MTG%20Log:%5B%5BMTG%20Log%5D%5D
JAN 5 1:19 PM
I liked the article on your music plan.
JAN 5 1:30 PM
I don't know if I could allow myself that limited of options though. And I rely on streaming technology. I have about 20gigs of music. The older stuff is very album oriented and intended to be listened to start to finish. Where now with digital stuff it is way different.
JAN 5 1:32 PM
I hear that.
JAN 5 1:33 PM
And I have grown to love you tube for finding random musicians.
JAN 5 1:33 PM
I've been trying that route.
JAN 5 1:34 PM
as well as other streaming+recommendation engines
JAN 5 1:34 PM
The best are often scraggly young and old guys on a porch obviously in the bedroom of a mobile. Home. Playing some awesome original songs.
JAN 5 1:34 PM
Or* not obv
JAN 5 1:35 PM
I had a good YouTube Downloader. But they shut it down.
JAN 5 1:35 PM
I'll try to find another good one for you.
JAN 5 1:44 PM
You don't have to waste time doing that.
JAN 5 1:56 PM
Also. Why do you not post pictures on your wiki or videos?
JAN 5 1:57 PM
I do have pictures if you know where to look. =)

I do not think very highly of pics and videos. A picture might be worth a thousand words, but the vast majority of the sets of 1k words cannot be expressed by a picture. I think writing is the most effective form of communication of the things I value.
JAN 5 1:58 PM
There is also a technical reason I don't.
JAN 5 2:00 PM
I don't disagree with 1k words cannot be expressed by a picture. I suppose my laziness is in line with societies laziness and effectively reduced my "posts" to short explanations.
JAN 5 2:01 PM
I find that when I post a picture with a large caption I get less interest than just the picture with a couple. Of words.
JAN 5 2:02 PM
My wiki is contained in a single-file. Pictures cost a lot of space. I can hotlink, but I'd prefer not to do that. My goal is to build something that is distributable on the bare minimum network.
JAN 5 2:02 PM
I realize that my style isn't going to generate much interest. I do it for myself though.
JAN 5 2:03 PM
I am driven often by the desire for an audience.
JAN 5 2:03 PM
I hear that.
JAN 5 2:04 PM
It's difficult to know how to engage in approval seeking in an adaptive and fitting way.
JAN 5 2:04 PM
And or others approval. I hold. Myself in such low standing sometimes I crave the encouragement and attention of others.
JAN 5 2:04 PM
I attempt so tastefully now. I have committed all sorts of sins in the past. But my interest now are fair and honest.
JAN 5 2:05 PM
But that is a complicated subject and difficult for. Me. To explain. In "short text" lol
JAN 5 2:07 PM
I apologize for taking so long to write my letter back to you.
JAN 5 2:09 PM
It has been an insane month.
JAN 5 2:09 PM
No need for an apology.
JAN 5 2:11 PM
I have no expectations.
