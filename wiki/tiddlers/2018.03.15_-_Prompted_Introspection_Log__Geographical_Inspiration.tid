title: 2018.03.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: Geographical Inspiration

!! What is a place that inspires you?

I'm trying to understand what actually inspires me in the first place. I find it very odd to say a "place" inspires me. Define place. Inspiration occurs in my brain, the cause being a set of perceptions in my brain. When you untangle the causal mess of my perceptions, it eventually points to objects external to me. Those are the causes (even if only partially) of my perceptions which cause my most (if not all) of my inspiration. It's not like there is just one place (in physics). 

Inspiration is largely internal for me, even though I can trace it to external origins.

In a way, the best way to answer this question is ask myself when I feel inspired. I feel inspired when I'm on my computer working on something valuable to me. Sitting at my seat, in my living room, surrounded by the people I love, working hard on something that matters. That's the location that inspires me.
