* I've been thinking about doing a kind of "Top" based exploration of subs. It's a crazy antipleonasmic introduction to cultural artifacts and perspectives I'd never encounter otherwise. I only have so much time though, and I don't want to waste it on garbage. It's tough for me to know how much of a risk I should be taking here.
* I've some additions. CriticalTheory, HistoryofIdeas, and stupidpol are all decent.
* I'm a bit worried new reddit is shaping the conservation out of Reddit, but I don't know where it would go. I still have no other comparable tools. I must be thinking about the problem all wrong. I need to be able to scroll through lists of topics and learn how to pick out [[salience]] which can be bootstrapped into higher [[S2NR]]. http://tildes.net/ still hasn't reached the effective network effect threshold. It's solid, but not enough. I already see 95% of this content. I think I'm asking for too much, lol. 
* For the life of me, I still don't understand why most people don't use Reddit. How the fuck? Does it feel too impersonal? Do they not know how to curate for themselves? Don't they know that they must sift?
** I'm addicted to infiniscrolling. When I was growin' up (sit down, lad, and listen), I had to look through page after page of search results. Most people I know look at the top 3-5 results on a page, and that's it. I still infiniscroll through the results all the time though. Reddit is the same way. You have to hyperread. You are going to miss tons, but you'll also pack in way more that way. This is an empirical, Bayesian venture. 
*** Virtue IS BIAS!!
** Admittedly, I consider myself hypocritically lazy in the infrastructure development and execution of my Redditing. I don't use multiple accounts, I'm not crafting the experience like I could. 
** I think Reddit is better than flat RSSing individual sites. The world is too big. I have to cut through the noise. The firehose is still impossible.
* I'm becoming less happy with the SSC-oriented work. Unfortunately, it still appears to be a voice I need to hear. 
* Are there too many subs? I feel like I do better with fewer than 20. 
* The pages don't change as fast as they used to. Reddit continues to be monetized.
* I haven't dropped anything. 
* Some of these subs don't offer enough. I'm scrolling through the recent history and click throughs on them, and they are confirmation bias or reminders half the time. What am I really looking for now? 
* It's stupid hard to beat HN.
