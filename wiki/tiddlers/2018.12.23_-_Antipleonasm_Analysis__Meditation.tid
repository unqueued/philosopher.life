!! Respond to the following:

[[Theories of Meditation]]:

<<<

* Buddhism
** See Frankfurtian Autonomy. [[SO]] desires targeting other [[SO]] and [[FO]] desires just is this model. The intuition appears to be able our [[fastmind]]'s ability to automate aspects of Frankfurtian self-modeling and self-control.
** The denial of self is not coherent. Who is doing the denying? I agree that we face an [[infinigress]] problem in the alignment of the [[SO]]; that resounding commitment is paradoxical. I'm not a compatibilist either (like Frankfurt), but I can see this is necessarily part of what we are. We reprogram ourselves. That we can deny some parts of ourselves to some [[dok]] is essential to our autonomy.
** Lots of woo here, but it points to something crucial.

* Predictive Coding
** If Frankfurtian autonomy is the rationalist side of defining what it means to be free, this is the empirical hardware explanation of our probabilistic inferences.
** "Minimize surprise" is a cute way to say it. I suggest that it's not that simple, but is often reducible to that (like cmc/benefit ratios in magic). The evolutionary pressures seek this kind of generalized efficiency, but there are clear exceptions
** Clearly, [[fastmind]] and [[slowmind]] are right here. This is what I'm talking about. It is virtue-theoretic. It is part of a Hegelian dialectic inside us. It is the Heideggerian read-to-hand vs present-at-hand. This notion has many names. One of the issues here is really understanding: "who is the boss, the [[fastmind]] or the [[slowmind]]?" That turns out to be at the heart of autonomy over desires, virtue, and knowledge.
** The notion that we are telling ourselves the stories of who we are screams out of here. Clearly, I think this is where all the marbles are. This is the best explanation I have found.

* Harmonics
** It's all about them good vibrations, man. Lol.
** If this isn't woo, then it's just talking about the natural suitability of algorithms and data structures (be it hardware or software). This seems like a pleasing way to visual efficiently using our computers [[irwartfrr]], in the fitting [[gfwiwcgws]] way, etc. When I use monitoring and log software on my machine, I get a feel for the bottlenecks. 
** I think this is reducible to the predictive coding claim.

* Neural Annealing
** My children and I speak about plasticity often. It's important for them to understand their brain development and the windows they have to shape their [[4DID]]. This is part of our autonomy. The crystallization and stripping away of our neural pathways and memories is part of the efficiency built into our brains.
** Virtue appears to be about constructing and reconstructing our probabilistic neural pathways. I am strongly reminded of some aspects of ML here. The ability to maximize plasticity or achieve this harmonic balance after practice may have serious merit.

In short, these all seem to be correct to some [[dok]].
