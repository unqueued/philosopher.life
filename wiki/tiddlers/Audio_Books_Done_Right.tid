title: Audio Books Done Right

* Create streamable content of Audio books with their text. Make it easy to hear it, pause, and read it. Keep tabs on your books. Turn all your books into something worth reading. Take giant libaries of books and turns them into this content. 
* Cryptocurrency could pay for it. Sit on the darknet. Fuck the police. 
** You could just do books out of copyright, but I think this is a mistake.

Imagine building a 100TB facility, downloading every book I can find, and building a true library of libraries.
