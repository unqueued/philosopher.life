title: 2019.04.21 - Prompted Introspection: Fam Vacay

!! Describe a family vacation.

Beyond visiting family, my children have never experienced a vacation with me. We've never had the money or time. We're right at the poverty line in the US. I'm hoping to do something this summer, but I'm not counting my chickens. I despise capitalists and reactionaries. This is just a small issue though. Most of our necessities are met, and vacations of any sort are close to a luxury (if not outright luxury in most cases).
