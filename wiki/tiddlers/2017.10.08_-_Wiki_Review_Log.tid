title: 2017.10.08 - Wiki Review Log

* It got too late for me to review [[Edit Notes: 10/6/2017]]. I did so today. 
* Ah, my font wasn't showing up on all devices, just locally. It took a while to figure out that it wasn't actually downloading. So, I've forced it into a webfont and a stylesheet. Woot!

* [[StyleSheet-Input]]
** Looks very pretty.
* [[2017.10.07 - Link Log]]
** Short and sweet. This is a good way to prevent myself from using surfing the web as a timesink.
* [[2017.10.07 - To-Do-List Log]]
** Didn't finish it all, but I got most of that finished. Good job!
* [[2017.10.07 - Carpe Diem Log]]
** This has been a wonderful week.
* [[2017.10.07 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Edited. I found one better.
** I don't care if it's shitty, I think it looks pretty. =)
*** I hope my wife reads this. 
* [[2017.10.07 - Wiki Review Log]]
** I'm glad to see my wiki review log is the place to do it. I'm not sure how to structure my yearly audit, nor my revamp. Should I do it better than this?
* [[2017.10.07 - Pipefitting Log]]
** It will pick back up. Let's finish math, and then we will dive in.

** It's okay man. Nobody is perfect.
** Also, edited "didn't," lol!
