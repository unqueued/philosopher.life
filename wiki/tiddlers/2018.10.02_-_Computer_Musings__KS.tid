title: 2018.10.02 - Computer Musings: KS

I believe I'm going to be rebuild two machines as evenly as I can with an enormous gift. I'm excited to have the chance.

Kimsufi was nonresponsive. Had to actually hard reboot. Wtf? Logs don't show me anything. That shitty dat script is that last thing that changed.

I told my wife that we probably will let go of KS. It has been super useful to us, but I just don't see the value in it anymore. I have the ratios I'm going to want (I've just let go of dozens of trackers). I use IPT and MAM, with TL as Mr. Backup (with 2TB of buffer, which is acceptable).
