!! Audit:

* My skin has been in the [[TDL]] game.
* The door has been getting work.
* I'm doing well on the [[Fitness Routine]] with the kids, but not so hot on getting out of the house. I am, ofc, clinically a hikikomori.
** No excuse, homie. Your family needs you to exercise.
* It is so refreshing to not hate this log (and partially myself). I like that I can be firm, assholish, fun, or chill. It doesn't matter. 
** You are doing fine. Keep it up.
* There's been a major shift in your life, and there's been a major shift in what you accomplish in this wiki. 
** I think the lack of cannabliss is obvious.
* Your house has improved significantly, and school with the kids has had its up and downs.
* The IRS isn't sick of hearing from me, and I don't want the caseworker to get sick of me (to the point of irrationally penalizing me). We need that money though.
* I finally broke down on m16. I'm glad that my daughter did the first lifting on the posting to ebay (even if I had to redo it, it was excellent practice for her).
** And, Black-Wolf-4 is finally here. That took forever, and 3 different tries. I'm embarrassed by how long that took, but it is what it is. He now has a sweet setup for a precariat 11yo boy.
*** Hard to build an $800 gaming machine on $400, homie. 
*** Still needs a KVM switch.
* I've yet to swim, but the kids have gone many times. I'm glad.
* I've been applying to jobs. I am not a terribly hopeful man on this front.
* We've been doing an okay job getting the kids to go out. Swimming supercedes it though.
* Overall, this was both practical and {[[Dream]]}y. I don't know how to improve it yet, but I'll keep practicing.
