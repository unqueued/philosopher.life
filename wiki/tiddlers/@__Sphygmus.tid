Daaaaaaamn, that is a dope splash/loading screen! Also, the ghetto RSS tool I use to track changes shows that as the background now! Lol.

You absolutely have the right to ask me. If it's not your place, I don't know whose it would be. I have no intention of causing you grief here either. This place hurts. I am also [[not done|2019.04.13 - SLT: TOU2]] grieving or worse, and I aim to be useful to you.

> Aren't you the least bit curious how my wife and I get along on this one?

I am, tbh, given how this type of friction contributed to (what felt like at the time) the dissolution of my family. I still don't walk past that wall with my father; my wounds are still too fresh for me to even consider having a genuine conversation about his views or relationship to faith & belief these days. I would only see my personal grief. I don't know the right words to ask you, though, and I don't feel it's my place to ask at this moment, so I'm content to pick up clues in reading and see if it comes out in further letters to DeathOfRobinhood.

Wow! You are dropping bombs this evening! I'm stunned.

It's been a while! I see I've got two links to check out in your link logs. Everything was all turned around when I visited your site - the nested sidebar tabs are pretty cool, and whoa, firmcoding has been fleshed out a lot! I can't believe it's almost been a year since I found kicks and you and wrote my first letter. 

It is hard coming back to my wiki; it doesn't feel like a second skin any more, but more like a skin that's been shed. I'm uneasy at the thought of reading some of my own words in the same way that I hate reading papers I've written after they've been written, even after they've been submitted and feedback returned.

> I feel your fear (even from your first letter), and imho, it's not just with me.

I haven't done words in a while. In this moment they feel trite and performative and I'm second guessing them, this sentence as I write it now. I'm afraid this started as a note to you and turned into something all about me and how I'm feeling, when I wanted to convey that I care about you and how things are going - when of course I've checked your wiki and gotten a rough picture of the past few months for you.<<footnote "tv" "and nodded my head in great appreciation of our shared enjoyment of //Russian Dolls//, and something else I can't remember now.">>

You might find [[publish.sh]] to be useful to your private->public conversion. Anything tagged //Public// survives to be compiled, and everything else is removed. [[html-to-tid.sh]] and [[tid-to-html.sh]] also help (this can be made cleaner, but it works). Also, cool to see an update to your site today!

I haven't seen you in while. I hope you are doing well. =)
