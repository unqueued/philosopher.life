!! Respond to the Following:

Happiness is not the consequence of having the best of everything, but rather making the best of everything you have.

Well, sometimes even one's best doesn't result in happiness, thus not strictly a consequence. Really, this is not a sufficient condition, but at best a necessary one. And, even then, I think it is about maximizing our happiness. Of course, making the best of everything you have will often increase what you have, improving upon your base material starting position as well. It's just not quite semantically right. It's got a kernel that is obviously right. There is a principle here that needs to be honed.

Can I do that? I don't know, Samwise. I'll try.

I see The Right and The Good at work here. The Right is about contextualizing The Good. At the very least, it requires altering our scope. 

<<<
Don't focus on what you can't have, focus on what you can accomplish with what you have. 
<<<

This is stoicism. This is the "ought implies can" principle applied in a reasonable way, not for judgment, but simply for the pragmatic pursuit of happiness. I've dropped the happiness part, although it is implied by the imperative statement, an ought. Let us be explicit like the original.

<<<
Maximizing your utility requires sifting through the available options to focus and apply the Utility equation on only those actualizable to you.
<<<

In a way, this is stilted as fuck. It's hard to capture it in plain language. Fear not: being technical removes the poetry, but not the elegance.
