title: 2019.01.17 - MB: Wrong Again

[[k0sh3k]] called up MB, and that spawned an hour-long conversation. We talked for quite a while about life. She's still learning how to be [[Human]] again she says. 

She's interested in [[The Gervais Principle]] and [[Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes]]. She said she is building a wiki to talk about the books with [[k0sh3k]] and I. Neat. I will do my best to help her (she doesn't have root on her desktop, but she has a chromebook).

This phone never sends me your signal messages! I just logged in and saw where you've been checking in in me. Thanks :relaxed:. Getting back from the West Bank took longer than we expected and my medicine is making me sleepy. Is it okay if I call tomorrow and, if so, what time is good for you?
