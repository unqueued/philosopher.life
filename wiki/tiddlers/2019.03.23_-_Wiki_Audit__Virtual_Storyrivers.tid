title: 2019.03.23 - Wiki Audit: Virtual Storyrivers

What if I'm thinking about Bob all wrong? It's the only tool that does what it does, but it sucks. I put up with it. I manage. The performance is awful, it's buggy, and it needs 10 devs, not 1. 

Often, I just need to bounce between story rivers. Is there a way to store storyrivers? Can we virtualize multiple-tabs inside a single tab? Surely, that is possible. If TW5-Navigator ever came alive, the raw performance would be hard to beat. I have so much lag right now; it's insane. I'm waiting on my computer too often.

I'd love to see the [[Open]] tab rebuilt to have a history and virtualized story rivers.
