title: 2014.02.12 - Dignity and Respect: Dignity As Status

I worry Waldron could be making a large mistake (but I’m not certain sure he does Waldron’s enterprise seems to be built on the wrong foundational assumptions. How could law be the natural habitat for a moral concept such as dignity? Yes, there are attempts to provide legal articulations of it, and jural laws designed to protect a moral dignity, but I don’t see how dignity is naturally a jural concept. Clearly, Waldron is moving from jural law to moral law. My gut instinct tells me this is the wrong direction.

Conceptually, law isn't necessarily normative. Nazi laws are still laws. Laws have no normative content in themselves – they have no true “ought” built-in. I fear there are some embedded disagreements over metaethical + philosophy of law relationships which might make Waldron's argument a non-starter for me.

Maybe Waldron thinks jural law tells us a story, as if jural law were some kind of practical microcosm or implementation of morality (which I would deny), that helps us realize what moral concept we are really after. Waldron isn't just considering just any law dealing with dignity - he is dealing with particular laws of note. Maybe we can learn something very important about the moral concept of dignity from legal articulations. Perhaps, but I think there are some central features of the moral law, regarding dignity, which likely can’t be elucidated by jural law.

What could jural law really tell us about moral law and moral concepts? Moral law gives jural law meaning, significance, or some normative status, but not the other way around. My intuition is that we cannot, conceptually, model moral law after jural law. The moral law is not contingent, not error-prone, not man-made, it is independent of us, it is absolute, it is overriding, it is binding. Jural law, directly or innately, has none of these attributes (although, the moral law may support and justify and require certain jural laws). Moral law has primacy. Jural law and its various concepts, are to be modeled after or to be constructed in virtue of moral imperatives.

Waldron seems to be arguing from a sociological, perhaps evolution of ordinary language point of view, a descriptive point of view, and then, I worry he moves to claim it is prescriptive.

Today, Waldron thinks, dignity is just an equally distributed legal or social rank. That doesn't, of course, tell us that it is actually normative. The “ought” is not obviously there. Waldron needs to secure that for us. Why ought we respect someone with dignity? A purely legal concept of dignity, not rooted in and/or required by moral law, is too shallow, contingent, and lacking in normative force. What dignity really consists in, if it is to be actually normative, must be moral, not jural.

Why should I think status is a legal concept? Why can't we have a moral status and a legal status? There is a difference between having a moral status or right to speak freely and having a legal status or right to speak freely – and the justifications for each are different in my view. Similarly, what counts as legal status, rank, right, or dignity may be quite different from the moral concepts, and justified by different reasons. The status that actually matters, however, is the moral status.

Perhaps I have greatly misunderstood Waldron’s enterprise.

Lecture 1


How could law be the natural habitat for a moral concept such as dignity or respect? Conceptually, law isn't necessarily normative. Nazi laws are still laws. Laws have no normative content in themselves – they have no true “ought” built-in.


What could jural law really tell us about moral law and moral concepts? Moral law gives jural law meaning, significance, or some normative status, but not the other way around. My intuition is that we cannot, conceptually, model moral law after jural law. The moral law is not contingent, not error-prone, not man-made, it is independent of us, it is absolute, it is overriding, it is binding. Jural law, directly or innately, has none of these attributes (although, the moral law may support and justify and require certain jural laws). Moral law has primacy. Jural law and its various concepts, are to be modeled after or to be constructed in virtue of moral imperatives.


Maybe Waldron thinks jural law tells us a story, as if jural law were some kind of practical microcosm or implementation of morality (which I would deny), that helps us realize what moral concept we are really after. Waldron isn't just considering “any law” dealing with dignity, after all, he is dealing with particular laws of note. Maybe we can learn something very important about the moral concept of dignity from legal articulations. I have my doubts though.


I fear there are some embedded disagreements over metaethical + philosophy of law relationships which might make Waldron's argument a non-starter for me.


Why should I think status is a legal concept? Why can't we have a moral status and a legal status? There is a difference between having a moral status or right to speak freely and having a legal status or right to speak freely – and the justifications for each are different in my view. Similarly, what counts as legal status, rank, right, or dignity may be quite different from the moral concepts, and justified by different reasons.


Waldron is moving from jural law to moral law. This is the wrong direction.


Ultimately, even if we wish to define dignity as a kind of status, we need to be able to show the grounds of it. Why do we have that status? Waldron points this out.


If there isn't a moral foundation to jural, status dignity, then why is it important?


Waldron seems to be arguing from a sociological, perhaps evolution of ordinary language point of view, a descriptive point of view, and then, I worry he moves to claim it is prescriptive.




Lecture 2


To clarify his previous lecture, he wants to consider dignity as a legal concept, and model the moral concept on that.


I worry we are just entering into a useless language game here to some extent. What he calls status dignity might just be what we mean by showing respect, and what grounds that status is what we normally call dignity. Or something like that.


Today, dignity is just an equally distributed legal or social rank. That doesn't, of course, tell us that it is actually normative. The “ought” is not obviously there. Waldron needs to secure that for us. Why ought we respect someone with dignity?


A purely legal concept of dignity, not rooted in and/or required by moral law, is too shallow, contingent, and lacking in normative force.


“We evaluate law morally using (something like) law's very own dignitarian resources.” (67)


He is right that our moral views have shifted in an analogous fashion to our legal views.
