title: 2019.07.30 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Symbolic Castration

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Symbolic castration - the final moment of analysis is reached when the subject is ready to accept this fundamental loss, to consent to symbolic castration as a price to be paid for access to his desire.
<<<

Yet another Lacanian psychoanalytic term I'm going to butcher like the savage analytic I am. The libidinal economy is present in Frankfurt's deepself theory of [[FO]] and [[SO]] desires too. The [[infinigress]] problem of autonomy cannot be cleanly resolved in way that will make us all happy as we are. There is a recursive, continuous problem renouncing total satisfaction in each new context.<<ref "m">> Our [[Self-Dialectic]] between affect and cognition narrows down the field of means to ends relationships, and the pursuit of [[awe]] and fundamental satisfaction will come at the cost of cognition while only being justifiably attainable through cognition. Even our limbic system is inextricably dependent upon the signifiers of something external to it. The cognitive symbolic is only an instrumental bridge between the affective subsymbolic and supersymbolic Other which dialectically [[infinigress]]es out of material reality into [[The Infinite]] ideality. Of course, each new completion puts us back on the treadmill though; this is how dialectics work. 

As reductio, this is yet another example of why anti-codificationism eats itself in trying to codify itself. You must be silent all the way down, or you must symbolize all the way down; may we build and discover it well together, nomad. We may temporarily appear to complete each other, but a new gap and price must be paid to cross it. We are not one, but only a part of it to varying [[dok]]. Inevitably, with intentionality, we structure ourselves in relation to [[The Other]] without end, but toward [[The End]].<<ref "c">> 

Ironically, denying [[The End]] or subjective self only resolves desire satisfaction conditions insofar as it actually dissolves one's autonomy and identity as a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is never you that accesses your desires then. But, by his own terms, this doorway is closed to him. It appears he is trapped into taking his own medicine here. As much as he doesn't want to hear it, [[Positive Disintegration]] requires accepting [[faith]] in [[The Good]] while accepting a metamodern [[DOR]] mindset. 

I wish I knew how to build sustainable, justifiable, one-size-fits-all eudaimonic treadmills beyond "be wise." The answer is out there, but it can never completely inhere in one of us. In rounds, take deep breathes in silent listening, for we must be long-winded together. Let us wander in wonder, nomads.
