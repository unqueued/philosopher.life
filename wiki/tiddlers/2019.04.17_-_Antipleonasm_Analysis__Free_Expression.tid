title: 2019.04.17 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Free Expression

!! Respond to the following gem:

If we don't believe in free expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.

Preach, yo! This is a classic for a reason. This is what Leftism is really about. I respect this tentpeg, and it's one of the only clear examples of a bifurcation between moral and political rights which I can't collapse. 

This is why [[Atropos]] is necessary. We have to have fine-grained, high-performance control of our free speech. I'm blown away by the number of people who don't find it necessary to enable and protect. Everyone should be trained in how to exercise their moral rights to these political and technical rights, even if most of the time we are morally obligated to relinquish them to varying [[dok]]. 

Decentralizing information power comes with significant costs, but there's no other way to ensure we protect the innocent, victims, whistleblowers, and the necessity of counterculture. 

It's not that we should centrally censor individuals, it's that we should decentrally ignore and filter individuals as individuals. Let the crazies (like me) uncensorably say what they need to say, and those who want to listen can. In the end, trust must be the backbone of filtering. Unfortunately, I have precious little experience and understanding of how to build this correctly. 

It's important to me that the reason I didn't have access to someone wasn't in virtue of poor or overly centralized infrastructures, but because I chose not to explore or be open to it.

As botting increases, it will only be humans who can sift for other humans, but even that will eventually fall, I'm afraid. Unfortunately, real ID's may become a thing to answer this.
