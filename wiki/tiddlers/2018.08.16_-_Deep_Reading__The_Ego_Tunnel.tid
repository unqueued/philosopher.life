This book is incredible. Many of these concepts and claims took me a long time to appreciate. It's very thoughtfully written. It's funny too. Unfortunately, I can't take notes effectively while I'm out in the world.

If I have a disagreement, it probably centers around the problem of [[The Good]] and realism.
