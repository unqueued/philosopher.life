title: 2019.08.13 - Prompted Introspection: 3D Movies

!! What is your opinion of 3D movies?

I don't give a shit. I hate going to the movie theater (and it's been a while since a play or opera hit the spot for me). If I'm going to see a public performance, I'd prefer it were music or lectures. There's nothing special about 3D movies to me, but I must be spoiled. I've lived in virtual worlds for so long that I find it to be lipstick and rouge. Perhaps one day someone will figure out how to really make the most of the medium. VR and augmented reality seem to have more options, but it's ridiculously expensive to the point that the average consumer simply can't afford it (I think most people wouldn't take the time to set it up either). 

Just pirate your movies.
