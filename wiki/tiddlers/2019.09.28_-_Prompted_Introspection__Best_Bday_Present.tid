title: 2019.09.28 - Prompted Introspection: Best Bday Present

//Oops, I went off track in [[Generic Prompts]]. Fair mistake in this case.//

!! What is the best birthday present you ever received?

I've had too many [[redpill]]ed moments and awakenings in thinking about my birthdays to find my history of them so pleasant. The presents are the kind of thing which fade for me. It's not that I don't appreciate gifts and things, but there tend to be more important things to concern myself with in the end. I'm not above enjoying the material by any stretch, but I think it's a broader picture: a clean house, working on our [[monster]]s, food I adore, feeling like I don't have to be radically responsible without feeling too guilty about it, substance use, and sex. Birthdays tend to be higher on the satisfaction bellcurve, a break, and lower stress (which isn't to say I don't have work to do on those days, but I feel like I have a different license, which is also probably irrational).
