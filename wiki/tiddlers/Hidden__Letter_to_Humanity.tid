Dearest of mine,

I am sorry to the family I love, [[Humanity]], and [[The Others]]. 

I am sorry, [[k0sh3k]]: I have failed you most among all Humans. You really have done your best like no [[other]] Human-alien I've ever met. You've been through thick and thin with me. You have listened inside and out, my love. You will always be the one for me. My zombie apocalypse is here. The world has eaten away at me.

I am sorry to you my children, [[1uxb0x]] and [[j3d1h]]. I have been and always will be a source of tremendous pain for you. I am often the opposite of what you deserve. Ultimately, I have not been and never will [[Be A Good Dad]]. It is my wish that you learn to love and like yourselves.

I am sorry to my [[Root Users]] and [[The Others]]. Goddamn, I tried really hard to survive in the desert. I looked for the oasis and the promised land. [[The Existential Game]] is over for me. Brand me a hypocrite or coward if you wish; I think you can admit I have legitimately attempted to face my demons.

I am sorry, [[Humanity]]. I have given what I have. I can see nothing is going to save us. My [[hope]] is gone.


Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
