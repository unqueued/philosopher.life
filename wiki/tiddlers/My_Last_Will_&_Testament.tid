!! About:

I have an acceptable legal document which isn't fully expressive, but gives all the space necessary to consider what I've written here. The legal document handles the legal problems that matter. This is where I write not the "legal" version, but instead the "moral" version.

!! Focus:

Hello You,

I guess I'm dead. *Assumes a new, incommensurable life, a ontology/epistemology, a new identity which reflects behind a Ring-of-Gyges oriented way. Let's say karma gave me a chance to communicate back a message, what would it be? 

Perhaps it is akin to passing a message from yourself outside [[The Matrix]] to message inside [[The Matrix]]. What would your dead-self tell you about how you lived? Imagine the most rational, compassionate, and empathic version of that beyond outside your current perceptions; design the God resembling [[The Good]] for yourself as best you can. What do you say?

Let me first say, I love you.
