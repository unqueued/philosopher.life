!! Audit:

* I'm still enjoying looking at my past answers here. I am always pleased to have a different answer.
** I feel too smug when my answer stands without question or like I'm somehow not thinking outside the box enough.
* Many of these questions jumble together.
* I am clearly hoping to narrow the list of the literal 1,000 questions down to the ones that matter, but more importantly, I'd like to find a way to add new ones.
** It's hard to find solid introspection questions.
** I know what I'm going to do!
*** I want prompted introspection questions from friends. I'd like them to pool it anonymously. I need to find a way to have them anonymously post it.
**** I'm not sure how to do that well or easy for them. It will require some thought to make sure all the loose ends are tied.
* Some of my answers are clearly ridiculously short.
* I am taking license in how I interpret some of these questions.
* I've not had to make many edits this time around. I do not know why.
