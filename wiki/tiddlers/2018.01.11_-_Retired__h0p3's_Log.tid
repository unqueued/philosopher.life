title: 2018.01.11 - Retired: h0p3's Log

//Be wise! Do your best! Never give up!//

Here is [[h0p3's Log Template]], inspired by our [[Family Log Template]]. This is a template for helping me interpret and digest strong emotions (good, bad, in between, or other). I need to inspect my volatile and intense emotions. I need to be rational about them. That doesn't mean I should haven't emotions, but it means I need to channel and analyze them to maximize my utility. Sometimes this is about thinking about my blessings, but admittedly, it is often about grinding my way through cognitive dissonance and mental disturbances. 

I'm still going to write random thoughts down and interesting tidbits.<<ref "1">> But, I also want to be more systematic in my self-inspection. I'm using a new template to get what may be the most relevant information out of myself. The goal is to help me reframe the world, myself, and my problems. I cannot continue to do the same thing over and over. Solutions require change, and generally those changes must start in myself, my attitudes, beliefs, desires, goals, and behaviors. Start small, work bit by bit, don't expect perfection, but attempt to grow and improve. What more can you do? Be practical, be honest, and listen to yourself.
