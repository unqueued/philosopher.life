Such is the retribution of self-worship, imposed by those who call God vengeful, a “joy-killing monster,” and “a freedom-restricting tyrant,” if you don’t give Him His due place. Fascinating how we wield power when we own it and then mock others with power for giving in to the same expression.
<<<

You don't have to self-worship to call the Christian God such things. Not all your opponents do either. You are painting with a broad brush.

This issue doesn't arise without cause either. Christian Theology has a very serious problem. Resolving the progressive revelation in Biblical interpretation is incredibly difficult. Are you sure you are being fair here? Even the most learned people I know on this topic will eventually admit they don't have a solution other than hoping it's true when pushed carefully. Demonstrating how the NT is a coherent extension and fulfillment of the OT is one of the fundamental tasks of Christian studies. Own up to the difficulty of this. You should. The last line here is borderline incoherent. Please, spell it out. I think you are wielding it hypocritically.

<<<
The enemy of our souls basically counters the claims of God, not merely by questioning them, but then by asserting that by disobeying God’s commands one will actually be promoted to taking God’s place.
<<<

The problem of autonomy isn't resolved anywhere, from I can tell (and, it's one of my areas of competence). This is an important problem though, since you aren't going to be able to talk effectively about what it means to even choose God either. I strongly doubt you've resolved the Arminian/Calvinist debate that Paul speaks about. Accepting that, you must also then extend the same charity to non-believers. I think you have a double-standard here.

I find this so odd, btw. Since, I actually think it was my faith that took me from my faith. I've 10 years of post-secondary education in philosophy literally because I see finding the truth as my vocation, and that started in my Christian faith. I think choosing to turn the other cheek is disobeying, and insofar as progressive revelation shows it is not, then I don't know why you get to say I'm not doing the same thing here.

Lastly, you need reasons to call non-Christians (you probably need to expand that far for your argument) the enemy of our souls. I just don't see it.

<<<
Once again at the heart of all temptation is the desire for autonomy and power.
<<<

You don't get to help yourself to and then discard autonomy only when it suits your purposes. You need an argument.

<<<
The human scene was steeped in the battle for autonomy and power right from the beginning.
<<<

Dominion and stewardship were gifted to us on the Christian view. Autonomy may be part of the imago dei (or in fact is). I think you aren't even engaged in good scholarship of The Bible itself here. You are scaremongering towards authoritarianism.

<<<
It is fascinating that the “world’s brightest mind” thinks an intelligence possibly exists out there that could destroy us, but no intelligence exists as Creator.
<<<

I've ridiculed Hawking plenty. He doesn't speak for me. The above is clearly rhetoric as well. Also, note the difference between agreeing to a transcendent creator (which is still a far cry from arrogantly thinking it is a personal God who is somehow anthropomorphized into a person like us) and considering the evolution of other finite creatures elsewhere in the physical universe. These are radically different. 

<<<
Another personal note, from having lived in Cambridge in the early nineties:
<<<

Redflag. You keep acting like you are an elite academic. Don't get me wrong. I can point to a history of people who were clearly doing amazing work outside of academia. I don't see a reason to think you count. I think you are a conman.

<<<
What does it mean to be an atheist? What does the “ism” of the atheist hold? Is it monolithic? Are all atheistic systems the same in political theory? How did that philosophy become a formal system, and how does one respond to its claims?
<<<

Note, of course, that you have to not only defeat the atheists, but the majority of humans who hold a religion different from yours. In fact, it's pretty clear that plenty of Christians would find your claims unacceptable as well.

I also think the "ianity" of Christianity has the same kinds of problems, including the monolithic, political theory, and formalization. What system of thought doesn't?

<<<
Let’s go back to the philosophical and categorical roots of this so-called belief, to its philosophical and cultural viewpoint.
<<<

"So-called" is pretty ridiculous here. Are you arguing against a figment of your imagination? This is rhetoric, again. This is about emotional persuasion far more emotion than the truth. This chapter is not meant to convince your opposition; it's meant to blindly inspire fervor in those who already believe.

<<<
The very Greek word from which we get atheism is really a simple conjoining of the negative with the divine.
<<<

This is a trickier problem than you imply. I'm not sure atheism is conceptually denying the divine. It is denying a Theistic God. There may be other conceptions of the divine they accept, defend, agree to, etc. If you are really trying to effectively argue to a non-believer, you'll have to admit that you are facing many other conceptions of the divine, of gods, of what matters, etc.

<<<
The alpha is the negative and theos is the word for God. At its starting point, from the very structure of the word itself, the philosophy of atheism means no personal, self-existent, autonomous, intelligent first cause of reality.
<<<

Note that they deny the conjunction of those things. They aren't conceptually denying a self-existent first cause of reality. They are denying the personal God of the Christians though (among others). 

You still have to define autonomy for me at this point. You wield it like a schizophrenic.

<<<
Ironically, in particular cultural milieus the word gets watered down so that in the days of the early Church, Christians were called atheists because they denied the existence of the gods of Greece and Rome. By the seventh century, Muslims branded Christians polytheists because of their cardinal doctrine of the Trinity. One can readily see how important it is to understand, from the orthodox point of view, what the beliefs really are rather than attributing cultural nuances to a system.
<<<

Uh, I don't see why you can escape cultural nuance. I consider religions to at the very least be memeplexes which help comprise our cultures (and those which are right have a correspondence to something real). They are cultures unto themselves. The history of the Christian memeplex appears to be a result of evolution, and you are going to need an argument to show how it's somehow more special than that as well.

<<<
People such as Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Krauss, and others who promote the aggressive side of this belief muster not a single new argument to defend their position.
<<<

That's not obvious at all. This is hyperbolic too.

<<<
That is why even other prominent atheists or agnostics consider them an embarrassment and say so.
<<<

We are outside of a popularity contest here, right? Does prominence matter that much? It's a problem for you either way here.

<<<
The well-respected Encyclopedia of Philosophy edited by Paul Edwards defines atheism as follows: “An atheist is a person who maintains that there is no God, that is, that the sentence ‘God exists’ expresses a false proposition… a person who rejects belief in God.”
<<<

This is what a scholar would turn to: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/. Please, read it.

<<<
Now this latter assumption is terribly prejudiced by culture and, one might dare say, flies in the face of how philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a longtime member of the faculty at Notre Dame, would describe belief in God—a “Properly Basic Belief” so common and so self-evident to the masses of humanity that, to them, no defense is needed. Of course, other philosophers take issue with that and say that in any debate this description would not stand the test of argument. Plantinga contends that the masses of people are not in the arena of debate; they intuitively believe that there is a power greater than themselves, and they seek ways in which to connect with that supreme being. Raised in India, I have seen this firsthand. Though it was not my personal belief, it was indisputably intrinsic to the mainstream of life, both for the unsophisticated and the highly educated.
<<<

That the masses agree to something isn't an effective justification in this arena. When you are writing an apologetics book, even to the layperson, you don't get to help yourself to the basic belief. You have to attempt to give the formal argument.

<<<
It is important to recognize that the Greeks, who really are the forerunners in systematic philosophical thought in classical philosophy (and as an extension of that came democratic government), attempted to define ultimate reality in abstract terms. Their musings and ponderings on ultimate reality cause some to even argue that Plato was probably moving toward a high monotheism. Whether one accepts that or not, what is important is that in their view, ultimate reality was inseparable from virtue and ethical norms.
<<<

I think you need to follow how your own belief system is profoundly affected by different interpretations of Plato. It's not clear to me you effectively appreciate that. Plato concept of [[The Good]] transformed Judeo-Christian concept of God you hold today.

Not all Greeks were Platonists either. There are many schools of thought to consider.

<<<
For many in Greek thought, the power of reason was supreme, and the freeing of philosophy and science from the mystical was a deliberate and purposeful discipline.
<<<

Eisegesis. Many philosophers we admire were shredding sophists. Yes, they did call into question religious perspectives. These philosophers were screaming about the nature of the mystical. You aren't even trying to pay attention.

<<<
But, I repeat, for the Greek thinkers, though they did not posit a God, one thing was certain—virtue and harmony were the emergent implications for life.
<<<

Wrong. Several posited a God of some kind, and I'm not talking about the mythology. Look at Plato's Good (which you only briefly consider), at Pythagoras' cult, at Aristotle's Thinking God of Metaphysics, etc. They didn't posit your God, but that doesn't mean they didn't believe in any God (although, they certainly influenced the memeplexes you hold today).

Virtue I agree to. Harmony only insofar as it is virtue, I agree to as well.

<<<
Actually, that philosophizing would fit into Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and the new tolerance of Western Secularism.
<<<

Your categories are misleading. It's similar to the problem of referring to atheists as naturalists. You seem to see patterns, but then when you go to draw the lines, you do so disingenuously. You can make your point without the sweeping argument here, and you should.

<<<
That is the new god of this age. One look at this and you can see how a political framework addresses the soul of a people when God is not known or sought.
<<<

Again, I remind you that your target here is not merely atheists. It's non-Christians in general. You categorization is self-serving.

The claim "God is dead" is a valuable one to consider, I agree. You don't get to dismiss secular traditions as the source of what's wrong in the world without an argument though. It's pretty obvious that a number of atheists and non-Christians are profoundly responsible for what is good and right in the world as well. It's also pretty clear that the political frameworks we face are sometimes negatively influenced or even crippled by Christians. I'm not going to let you off the hook here when you are this sweeping.

<<<
We can readily see how critical it is that values be upheld for the public good.
<<<

The standard warcry. Why should I take up your values? What are the universal values? They begin long before the discussion of Christianity in the dialectic.

<<<
For now, we see how the early Greek philosophers and early nontheistic spirituality or mystery religions believed in a structure of virtue for one’s individual life and destiny.
<<<

It's not clear that you do at all. You've not even touched on virtue theory.

<<<
There were, however, very important differences in terms of why they thought this way and what they believed the purpose of life to be.
<<<

This is the problem though: you don't appear to understand what their beliefs really were. Why should I grant you these moves?

<<<
That, to me, is key. As I have travelled for some four decades and have literally met with thousands of individuals, either one-on-one or in small groups after the public forums, there are really a handful of questions that emerge.
<<<

That doesn't make them the right questions. That doesn't mean you were looking correctly. Anecdote often has problems, but I think it's all we have sometimes. What are you to do if I can say I've also got plenty of experience, but my results contradict yours?

<<<
The first question is of life’s purpose and meaning: What does life and living really mean?
<<<

I don't think this is the first phenomenological question. I think that question is begged initially before we hermeneutically spiral around to consciously evaluate it. I grant it is a version of the most important question though. I do appreciate that aspect of your argument.

<<<
Then there comes the question of pleasure and enjoyment: How do I fulfill my desires?
<<<

Why should I agree this is the question that follows? In fact, this appears to be more explicitly asked before the other from what I can tell. Think Kierkegaard's stages here.

<<<
The pursuit of pleasure is at the core of our existence.
<<<

That is an assumption which seems pretty easily denied. Is this more rhetoric?

<<<
We work, we earn a living, we return to our homes, but then we make decisions for our enjoyment: Are there any boundaries for pleasure? Then there is the third question: What does one make of all the suffering and pain we see in this world?
<<<

These are //excellent// questions, but I don't think you've organized or understood their relationship well enough in these few lines. You've forgotten several other areas, including epistemic normativity, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, etc. We all have common sense notions, but that's the point. You've got to have the doxastic material to work with in the first place. In a way, I see this question of how to be the best philosopher we can be in each of our contexts.

The third question is anathema for you. The problem of evil is one of the reasons I moved to being a deist as a Christian. Standing where I am now, I think it rules out the agency of God (I'm aware of the workarounds, but this appears the most plausible option to me). You won't be able to satisfactorily respond to it as a theist, imho.

<<<
There you have it. Meaning, pleasure, pain. And all of these hang on the hinge of the fourth major question, a very defining one: How and why am I here in the first place? 
<<<

I don't see why it hangs on that. You need an argument for it. I agree they are obviously related though.

<<<
That defining question is answered confidently by the atheist that we are here by accident.
<<<

Plenty of atheists agree. Not all do. More importantly, and I have to keep saying it because you continue to make this unsavory move: you have to show why Christianity is superior to all the other paradigms. The issue of accident or intention can be interpreted differently in many of them. I think your claim is a sweeping generalization again.

<<<
Turn back the clock and try the same thing again and it will never happen once more. Our presence is a cosmic accident for which there is no script for life or preassigned purpose. But let us be absolutely clear: The atheist has placed all other definitions of life’s imperatives on this one hinge, that we exist on this earth and struggle with human personality, morality, and reality without a personal, moral, or real first cause.
<<<

Whoa. You don't get to help yourself to that claim about atheism. It's obviously conceptually open to at least some of those properties. You are strawmanning hard here.

<<<
That’s the leap of faith—to believe that ultimately life is matter and that it therefore doesn’t really matter. If you submit to the first conclusion, you are inextricably bound to the rest that follow.
<<<

I'm fine with having a serious beef against naturalist, materialist, and physicalist positions (although, you need to show your work). You can try to show how it's ultimately reductive to the point of collapsing moral realism. You don't, however, get to paint all of your opponents with this brush, and you shouldn't even remotely imply it. This is deceptively self-serving. You are fishing with keywords to persuade without a sustained argument.

<<<
Gould states unequivocally that meaning is not decipherable by us. No higher answer exists, he says, and we have to find the answers on our own terms. This incredibly answerless answer is what sends Western values on the slippery slope of nihilism.
<<<

What do you think Nietzsche was saying? That's exactly what he is worried about. Resolving postmodernism is our plight, and Christianity has been crumbling under its own epistemic foundations. Very few things seem to stand up to this beast. Furthermore, your example only shows one minority, imho. The "not all" problem is a big one for you.

<<<
 But there is more. If meaning is not within the purpose of our existence, the second struggle is whether to seek a boundary for pleasure or eliminate all boundaries.
<<<

This is not clearly written. I think specificity here is exactly what would reveal your argument to be fraudulent.

<<<
The difference between a nontheistic religion and an atheistic worldview is literally worlds apart.
<<<

Peel apart nontheistic and atheistic for me, please. We may even have serious problems in the conceptual analyses of religion and worldview. I'm worried you are being inconsistent too. It's time for definitions, sir.

<<<
The difference comes from the explanation for theistic thinking. Both the realities of pleasure and of pain demand answers and explanation, whether life has meaning and whether there is a solution to the problem of pain. To arrive at a formal and creedal denial of a supreme being opens the door to all kinds of debates and arguments on the entailments of such a hopeless foundation.
<<<

Why is it hopeless? Why does the problem of pain or evil require a supreme being like yours to solve? The problem of evil is likely an unsolvable problem for you. I consider it a reasonable argument against the Christian God (and even Christian's should admit it's a real problem). I think you  choose to call something theist whenever it suits you here. 

I say this as someone who also thinks there is [[The Unmoved Telos]]. To some [[dok]], I want you to be right, and I think you are about there being objective purpose and meaning. You aren't giving the argument though.

<<<
From that starting point the remaining three answers are literally up for grabs, so let’s see how the religious nontheist and the secular atheist deal with the entailments of their starting points. When you start off with “no god,” you end up with the strangest of mental manipulations to keep you from the logical arc of reasoning.
<<<

Why should we agree? I'm afraid your claims are themselves "the strangest of mental manipulations to keep you from the logical arc of reasoning." Looks like projection to me.

<<<
And the first mistake for the atheist is to position science into doing what it was never supposed to do.
<<<

I'd argue Christians and other theists often misposition science. It's also not clear that atheists always (or even usually) make a mistake here either.

<<<
Has anyone provided a proof of God’s inexistence?
Not even close.
<<<

Nor a proof of God's existence, not even close. The issue of epistemic justification here, of course, is not going to be based on certainty at some level. Proof requires context too. Even the logical possibility of something doesn't give us epistemic justification, and what counts as a "good reasoning" seems to be our starting place. The problem is, you have to engage in that before you even begin trying to give reasons for the authority of the Bible. 

This call and response rhetoric is gross. 

<<<
Has quantum cosmology explained the emergence of the universe and why it is here?
Not even close.
<<<

I'm of the belief it can't. But, I also think it's important to see science as a conversation and method which doesn't take itself to have solved this problem, and in another sense, shouldn't try to either. Regardless, it's still on your shoulders to show us why your Christian cosmology explains it. To yours I say: "Not even close."

<<<
Have the sciences explained why our universe seems to be fine-tuned to allow for the existence of life?
Not even close.
<<<

Actually, I think science is the only tool that has allowed us to even understand the conditions. The clockwork teleological problem is still a matter of faith in either direction. This does not help your case.

<<<
Are physicists and biologists willing to believe anything so long as it is not religious thought?
Close enough.
<<<

Yikes! Redflag! 

Note of course, religious thought is different from Christianity and theism. You are lying through your teeth here. Don't you see why people scoff at Christians who take this line of reasoning seriously? It's really awful.

Take it from a man who grew up in that background. I know the mistake because I've made it.

<<<
Has rationalism in moral thought provided us with an understanding of what is good, what is right, and what is moral?
Not close enough.
<<<

I don't think you can even define rationalism (a very technical word). And, how would you know? You have to give an argument here. Why should we think you have the answer here? Why is your approach more justified?

<<<
Has secularism in the terrible twentieth century been a force for good?
Not even close to being close.
<<<

Not everything in the 20th century has been terrible. I'm not sure how to make this judgment. The argument, however, sounds like an appeal to nostalgic conservativism and emotional traditionalism. I don't see why you get to claim secularism is responsible for all that is bad. You do realize, of course, that it's ridiculously easy to point out where Christians and the Christian memeplex are profoundly guilty of evil in our world, right? It's not obvious to me that you, your foundation, your sect of Christianity, or even Christianity at large is a good thing anymore. This is, of course, a [[gfwiwcgws]] kind of problem.

<<<
Is there a narrow and oppressive orthodoxy of thought and opinion within the sciences?
Close enough.
<<<

How is your unjustifiably narrow line of reasoning not just as problematic? Evangelicals are notoriously narrow-minded; when it comes to the Big5, they score low on openness. Are you sure this is where you want to go? You're in trouble.

Science narrow in its empiricism isn't oppressive at all. Your position is simply anti-science, and I say that as someone who rails against scientism  (albeit, I think we have different approaches to how we define and reason about scientism).

You know, I intensively believe in objective moral truth. I have strong opinions about it, and I've spent a lot of time studying it. I'm quite educated in the matter, and I have a very narrow point of view. [[The Right]] is the universal normative context of all particular contexts, thus it is quite narrow. I'm fine with narrow, but only insofar as you can stand toe-to-toe in the dialectic through justification.

<<<
Does anything in the sciences or in their philosophy justify the claim that religious belief is irrational?
Not even ballpark.
<<<

Perhaps not all religious beliefs, but surely some. You aren't even trying to look at this carefully. This feels like a 2-minute hate speech.

<<<
Is scientific atheism a frivolous exercise in intellectual contempt?
Dead on.
<<<

Why do I not get to say the same thing about what you are saying here (albeit //anti//-intellectual contempt)? Don't get me wrong, it fills me with glee to show that philosophy is the master discipline. You aren't practicing philosophy even well though. You haven't put the sciences or scientists in their place.

<<<
One has to commend Berlinski and others like him for calling the bluff of those hiding behind science and making sweeping assertions against belief in God. In fact, there is so much contradiction even within the exact sciences that anyone who speaks for all obviously does not respect the different disciplines within science.
<<<

Yet, you have made a lot of sweeping generalizations presuming to speak for all.

<<<
In Western cultural speak, we have basically gone from being a rootless society to a ruthless society.
<<<

You are overidealizing here, imho. I think it was virtually always ruthless.

<<<
I know scholarly thinkers in the field of chemistry who have issued challenges to others, asking them to show evidence from chemistry that the move from primordial slime to Homo sapiens is even theoretically possible. Professor James Tour of Rice University is one such scholar. In fact, cosmologist John Barrow said to Dawkins, “You have a problem with these ideas, Richard, because you’re not really a scientist. You’re a biologist.”
<<<

I don't mind prioritizing the disciplines for epistemic justification. Philosophy is king. Even religious studies is a subset of my own discipline. Regardless, Dawkins really is a scientist. I really disliked the man as a Christian, but I still read his books. 

Science tends rely pretty heavily on decentralizing consensus and peer review. That may be a monkeywrench for you here.

Furthermore, this looks like a signal to creationists rather than a good argument.

<<<
Interesting, isn’t it, how the methodology and implications vary between the disciplines? 
<<<

Interesting, isn't it, how asking vacuous questions doesn't always provide an argument?

<<<
In America, we say that we are a nation of laws. That sounds fascinating. Are we implying that other nations are nations without laws? No culture on earth has more laws than the Islamic world. Their laws extend to what you eat and when you eat, how you marry and whom you marry, how you bank and with whom you bank, when you fast and how much you give, which way you 
<<<

You sure there's no Islamophobia here?

<<<
So we are a nation of laws. Let’s move further. To use a metaphor, law forms the roots from which our culture is built.
<<<

Why should I agree to that claim? That's not a metaphor; that's an assertion that requires justification.

<<<
The trunk then becomes the political system; the branches and the leaves or the fruit of the tree become the expression of the culture. That’s the figurative description of how we build a culture.
<<<

I think you are radically oversimplifying the notion and origins of culture. What does your mistake really imply? It seems authoritarian and fundamentalist.

<<<
When you think about it, it is actually circular. We act as if law just came into being and is self-evident. The question should really be, what holds the law in place?
<<<

Human laws are a subset of culture (or subculture). Trying to make sense of your metaphor: the whole tree, roots and all, is culture. The metaphor isn't working nicely for you.

<<<
The laws that legitimized slavery were railed against by a moral intuition that this exploitation and dominance of a people was morally wrong. Ironically, in their songs both the slave and the slave owner called upon God to rescue them or validate them. They weren’t calling upon nature to do so. Even in the context of the dominance of the Indian people by the British, Bertrand Russell, of all people, said that it was doubtful the plea from reason would have succeeded against the British except that it appealed to the conscience of a Christianized people.
<<<

I think this is one of the reasons I don't trust the moral intuitions of most people. I've studied moral psychology enough to realize what deontic and virtue theoretic actually looks like. It's very easy to see people using their moral intuition to defend slavery. I still see it today! It's another reason why I expect really good reasoning, not emotional arguments from apologists.

This is always the problem with manipulating people's emotions. It is effective, but that doesn't mean we have the right to do so. Justification of coercion is mandatory, and you don't have it. That's exactly why I think this book is outright immoral. Solid Christian apology, as far as I can tell, only ends up buying the logical possibility of justifying your private faith, but doesn't give you solid public reasons that everyone should agree to.

<<<
This is where worldviews come into play. What holds the laws of a nation? It is the moral soil that must hold the roots.
<<<

Legal positivism is probably correct about the basic analysis of the concept of a government and law. I agree the underlying justification, however, must be moral. Unfortunately for your argument, non-Christians and atheists are quite capable of providing this justification.

<<<
Law, philosophy, love, education, justice… all are built not on reason alone but on moral reasoning. This is the discipline under which atheism fails, and the ideas of atheism will be crushed under the very system constructed to make the one who points the guilty finger ineffectual.
<<<

Why would you think atheism fails here, except that it simply suits the worldview you hope to impose on your audience without reason? Reason is the only way to respect each other's autonomy (oh wait, you don't respect that either). 

<<<
The hunger of the human heart is for meaning, reason, purpose, and value, and atheism simply does not have either the answers or the explanatory power to make it possible to build a life on the foundation it offers.
<<<

You have to have an argument. Again, I also think you have to show why Christianity, as opposed to all the other religions, is the somehow a better answer.

<<<
That is why some of the best of them discover at life’s termination point that their philosophy was reasoned into irrationality and their temporary victory, pyrrhic—it cost the victor more than it cost the vanquished.
<<<

I agree that finite reason breaks down when reasoning about the infinite (although, that is being very generous to your claim here). I think you aren't being charitable. You claim victory without having actually run the race.

<<<
The chapters to come show the difference between Jesus and secular “isms” in the why of life itself. Our first comparison will be a deeper exploration of atheism—the general “ism” underlying all other secular worldviews. Then we proceed chapter by chapter to confront the secular gods that guide our neighbors and our nation. So far we have glimpsed only the tip of the iceberg. Let’s see where the differences really take us.
<<<

Calling the atheist's belief "secular gods" isn't charitable. Without a definition of God or gods, you are in position to assert it. The odd part is, I'm willing to grant some version of the fact that everyone must have faith, but I just don't see why it's a faith in a God. I agree there is a "Bob" turtle of "turtles all the way down." Now, you have to show why Christian God is somehow going to be a better explanation and justification than what atheists and all the other religions provide.
