** As usual, some excellent points and some unearned skepticism mixed in this bag. The trash talk here is epic. I'm glad to have seen it.
** Look, I know I'm not reading standard analytic philosophy here (nor standard continental, even though it has its roots there). I'm okay with that.

Through social and cultural conditioning, we each build a false self—an ego—and imagine that is who we really are.

This ego is a harmful illusion that prevents us from perceiving reality as it truly is.

Meditation gradually strips away the layers of ego. Buried deep within, we find our true selves.

This true self is radiant, pure, undivided, perfectly simple.

Our true self is none other than Ultimate Reality itself—or is directly, intimately, organically connected with that Eternal Absolute Infinite, which is the entire universe.

The essence of all religions is the transformative perception of that magical connection to all beings. It is the profound, non-conceptual experience of the Oneness of the universe.

This is heart and the path and the goal of Buddhism: the mystical experience of enlightenment.

Ah, but that is the Dialectic that Dasein is trying to uncover, harness, and sublate. We are trying to find ourselves, to unify ourselves, to be effective coherentists in the epistemic sense. And, unifying ourselves takes a great deal of thought. Of course meditation will have a tendancy to help some people with their problems; they weren't being metacognitive without meditation, and all of the sudden, now they are exercising the autonomy necessary to correct the incompatibilities in their competiting Intuition Networks. 

This isn't the essence of religion, this is a non-trivial portion of existentialism as I understand it converted into a religious language. It's a viral meme because it speaks to something quite valuable to us in a way the masses can understand.
