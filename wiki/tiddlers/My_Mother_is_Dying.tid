title: My Mother is Dying

I don't know when it will happen, but her illness is going to take her life. I don't have the words. I need to find them though. My mother needs to know how much I love her. She needs to know how grateful I am have and to have had her as my mom. There is the rift between us, and we both know it. I don't know how to reach out and touch her. We're both in so much pain it might not help. We are so afraid not to hurt each other, and perhaps so afraid of being hurt, that I'm failing to tell my dying mother whatever it is that I'm supposed to say. I don't even know what to say. 

It has been the hardest year of our lives.
