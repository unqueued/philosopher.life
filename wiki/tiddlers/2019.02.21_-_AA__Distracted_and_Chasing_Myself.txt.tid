THU 1:10 PM
Not sure I have completed anything. It’s an incomplete piles kinda day
THU 1:10 PM

THU 1:10 PM

THU 1:12 PM
Out of the pit, onto the bottomless sea.
THU 1:13 PM
Tonight [[AG]] and I get to go bowling tonight with her troop
THU 1:13 PM
Good thing we have the walkie-talkies and food rations.
THU 1:13 PM

THU 1:13 PM

THU 1:15 PM

THU 1:15 PM

THU 1:15 PM
I beg you to watch //The Big Lebowski//.
THU 1:15 PM
I googled it and I shall I promise
THU 1:16 PM
You will have to tell me what you love and hate about it. It is a movie I still don't understand well enough. I am moved by it.
THU 1:17 PM
The bowling therapy is right on the money.
THU 1:17 PM
Will [[UJ]] be going bowling too?
THU 1:18 PM
Or is it more a girl thing only (since that is the troop)?
THU 1:18 PM
He usually has either his civil war band or his polka band practice in Bardstown on Thursdays....
THU 1:27 PM
When I asked him if he had band tonight he said only if I needed him to do something tonight ...
THU 1:28 PM
So I guess he is home but he likes bowling
THU 1:29 PM
Maybe I send him next week hehe
THU 1:29 PM
In his polka band lederhosen
THU 1:30 PM
Lol.
THU 1:32 PM
He is a riot.
THU 1:32 PM
His is the only mustang with a variety of tubas and a driver in lederhosen—makes for interesting stops at the gas station
THU 1:33 PM
=)
THU 1:33 PM
And he is proud!
THU 1:34 PM
I love that about him
THU 1:34 PM
He should be. It's pretty badass.
THU 1:36 PM
He does the polka band because his dad is in it.
THU 1:37 PM
That is awesome.
THU 1:37 PM
What's his dad play in the band? (I know [[UJ]] can literally play anything)
THU 1:38 PM
The civil war band is becoming a problem because there is an Abraham Lincoln impersonator that he swears is stalking him
THU 1:38 PM
Uh...lol.
THU 1:38 PM
Jack plays the trumpet
