title: Employment: Application Log

* 2019.08.09
** Interview went ridiculously brief. It didn't feel like an interview. It felt like friends introducing each other to me. Justin said he had been keeping tabs on me through my teacher, but that clearly isn't the case. Clearly, I am still highly recommended by the most important person in the room though.
** Maybe it was short because I said I didn't want to travel full time. 
** I talked about my hobbies since I was asked. I talked about [[Afterschool Teaching]] for a bit. We talked about tradeskill demographics. My grey/whitebeard must be misleading them.
** I have no idea what the outcome will be.

*** Training is next month.
** I've set up an interview on the 9th of next month for the fitter union

** Questions:
*** On average, how long does a retinal image session last?
*** On average, how many miles are traveled each day?
*** This is temporary work. What are the odds of being contracted again, and when would that begin?
** Interview was not boring.
*** The job apparently was about "compliance" (and the man had no idea how to say it). It appears to be a mix of hunting for people to remove them from insurance under the guise of preventative care, but he could not respond to the fact that lots of the diabetics he treats cannot afford their meds.
*** He told me that it wasn't really a 200-mile radius. I'd be traveling by plane and staying overnight more than half the time according to his numbers.

** Interview Today, Kristan, Traveling Retinal Imager
** Felt a bit scammy, but we'll see.
** Contract work, ends at the end of the year, sometimes they rehire (but sounds unlikely)
** 8 hour average (paid 8 no matter what though...hrmm), schedule given in advance, 200-mile radius!?
** $10/hour, $10/per imaging, $250/per month for gas, $1k at the end, with 1-month pay severance
*** She says to expect $100-120 a day but also said it averages to $20 an hour. Her math is clearly wrong.  
** Video training is on the 19th, then they fly me out for training in Atlanta, hand me equipment, practice, and then I'm basically on my own.
** Seeking compassionate, tech-savvy people. She walked me through how to interview given my resume, told me what they are looking for, etc. Fascinating experience.
** Unfortunately, I have little control over my reactions to eyes. I tear up very quickly.
** Second video interview tomorrow at 1pm, Duo
