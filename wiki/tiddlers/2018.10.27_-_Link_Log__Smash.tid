*** Extremely crystallized.

* KYS
** https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/413372-medicare-for-all-will-never-work-so-lets-stop-pushing-it
*** I agree "Medicare for all" is a failure because Medicare is a failure (I worked in the industry). This is the wrong move.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/22/cognitive-enhancers-mechanisms-and-tradeoffs/
*** Perhaps not worth my time at all.

* Think About It
** https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9k7nmp/first-twitter-gave-me-power-then-i-felt-hopeless-v25n3?
*** An identity problem. It does seem reasonable to think identity is something consistent about us.
** https://www.thenation.com/article/what-happened-to-the-steady-job/
*** And, yet, no mentioned of socialism. Hello.
** https://quillette.com/2018/09/25/forget-nature-versus-nurture-nature-has-won/
*** That doesn't seem to be enough evidence or a good enough argument. I agree our hardware has far impact than many want to admit.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/opinion/sunday/phonics-teaching-reading-wrong-way.html
*** We had top 1000 most common words in English as sightwords that were memorized. We went phonetically at the same time and for everything else. It took us ~30 hours over 4 weeks to teach my 3yo daughter to read at a 1st grade level.
** https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/brainwaves/why-life-does-not-really-exist/
*** Spinoza nods his head. Incompatibilists everywhere start puking.
** https://hackernoon.com/20-top-lawyers-were-beaten-by-legal-ai-here-are-their-surprising-responses-5dafdf25554d
*** I think the real winners are those who use AI to destroy those who aren't. Avalanches of information, tiny things which give rise to an emergence that are even more likely to be missed. I think this will be an offensive weapon until everyone is forced to use it defensively.
** https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9nvv/the-blowjob-paper-scientists-processed-109-hours-of-oral-sex-to-develop-an-ai-that-sucks-dick-autoblow?
*** Lol. I bought one of the originals. 
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/style/phones-children-silicon-valley.html
*** I just don't see another way of becoming technically literate. I understand the popularity of the opinion.
** http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/the-selfish-dataome
*** Dataome is a nice word. I wish STEM read more philosophy. We've been talking about this structure for a long time.

* Fishy
** https://medium.economist.com/capitalism-is-becoming-less-competitive-cdaa18435dd8
*** Looks like apology to me.
** http://fortune.com/2015/04/29/why-millennials-and-the-depression-era-generation-are-more-similar-than-you-think/
*** Rofl. But, no, socialism isn't the answer.
** https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/hilary-greaves-global-priorities-institute/
*** Yes. They raise good questions, but they are clearly couching their egoism in something that is easier to swallow. I know what you really are.
