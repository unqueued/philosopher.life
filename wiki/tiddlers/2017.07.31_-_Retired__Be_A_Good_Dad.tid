title: 2017.07.31 - Retired: Be A Good Dad

I inject dangerous and powerful memes into my children like a mad scientist. I try to be that neurosurgeon who removes their autonomy on this topic, who programs his own children to the best self-teaching AI-bots pursuing wisdom possible. I want them to be as wise as they possibly can, whether they wanted it to begin with or not. I move fast and break things in my frantic approach to teaching them to be philosophers. I am so unwise that I can never teach wisdom effectively, yet I must be as effective as I can (and I will fail that too). I am profoundly flawed and fallible, unfit for this task, and bad at it to boot. I will never be the dad that my children deserve. Yet, I must strive to be that man.

I hope to be the man on whose shoulders my children stand, and I hope to be a giant for them. I must help them climb that mountain, to be the best goddamn sherpa I can be.

What kind of dad teaches his 7 year-old First Order Logic with light splashes of Second Order logic and metalogic?  

Will they ever forgive me? I wrestle so brutally with them on this topic. I give them no windows or outs. I am constantly forcing them to look at it, to engage in it, to learn about it. I give them every angle I know how. This wiki exists in part to demonstrate Wisdom is the infinigressing Good of The Good for us.
