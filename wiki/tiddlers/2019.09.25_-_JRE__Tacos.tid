title: 2019.09.25 - JRE: Tacos

Bro grabbed some of them amazing tacos and called me on the way back. He's been so busy. I don't know how they do it; babies are so much work.

Plumbing is done. Baby is not feeling well but smiling. =)

My brother told me about his work. He made me laugh. He's got a friend there who knew to stick out his hand for candy when my brother was opening a bag of M&Ms, and that's awesome. It's great that my brother has a friend at work. 

We didn't have much time to talk, but we did get to do our dailies and quick BRD run for Coren's festival quest. My brother figured out at 1.3 speed blue daggers are better than 1.4 purples. Self-hasting weapons are the only better option, I assume. If you have daggers, you need to try mutilate. Mutilate+Cleave and perhaps Execute as well seems strong.
