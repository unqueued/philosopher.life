title: 2017.06.29 - Pipefitting Log

I had told my teacher I'd be coming next Wednesday for the test. I'm basically done with the pipefitting course except for studying for this exam. I'm highlighting and studying, and that's it. 

I don't want to pressure my employers today about the tool list. I want to give them the chance to do it without me getting on them. This is a feeling out process, and I also don't want to start it off on the wrong foot. We will see. I'm anxious about the possibility that they won't respect my list, or that it will somehow reflect poorly on me. We will see. If they don't send the letter today, then I'll contact them tomorrow about it. I should call Barry first. 

Getting the car fixed up is the only thing I really must accomplish today. I'm waiting on the landlord's fixer to finish dealing with the light and dishwasher leak, then I can head over to the car shop.
