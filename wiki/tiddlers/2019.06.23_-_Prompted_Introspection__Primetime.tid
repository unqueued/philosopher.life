title: 2019.06.23 - Prompted Introspection: Primetime

!! What age would you consider the prime of life? Why?

I was annoyed by this question last time: [[2017.12.13 - Prompted Introspection Log: Prime of Life]]. 

I have different primes available to me. I don't know how long I will live though. My sexual mating game prime value likely obtains when I'm 50. My special learning prime is well over, and I am in mental decline (rapidly, imho). My physical prime was probably in my early 20's and then again in my early 30's. I believe my vocabulary prime won't be for another decade or two.

The average age a magnum opus or primary work for a philosopher is delivered is ~44. I'm hoping my wiki won't even be near its peak for another two decades though. 

I assume this is the prime age for fathering. It's do or die, make or break, sink or swim now. I hope all the work I've done and am doing begins to bear fruit for my offspring. They will probably be enslaved by capitalism, but I have given them the liber and libre tools of dignity as best I can (which is hardly to say I am competent).

I can't see far enough into the future to tell you what the prime of my life has, is, or will be as a unified answer.
