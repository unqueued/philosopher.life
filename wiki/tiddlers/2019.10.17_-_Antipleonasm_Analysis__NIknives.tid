!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out that's not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven't even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound. They won't even admit the knife is there.

Preach, yo! [[YWSOAM]]. This one is haunting for me. As the resident paranoiac, I find most people think I'm insane when I state my interpretation of our species and the state of affairs. Most people will grant me some part of what I say, but the whole knife is something ignored by most. It's too painful or it implies too much responsibility. The "they" is broad and inclusive in my eyes, as is the "you" (though to a lesser degree).
