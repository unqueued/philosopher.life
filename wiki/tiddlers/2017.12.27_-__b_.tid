Redpill sexism time: Women don't perform as well in academia, on average, not because they aren't capable, but also not because they are "held back" by a glass ceiling as much as they'd like to think (such a ceiling exists for men as well), but really because: they don't have to perform. Why would they work that hard? Seriously, look at the high IQ disciplines, and they are vastly outnumbered. Women with high IQs obviously have more price efficient utility options available to them. Selfishness is the best descriptor.
