!! Audit:

* I'm pleased to find questions I want to answer again.
* My answers are more autobiographical, historical, and personal than usual in some sense.
* I can feel the pressure release on this log by diverting it to [[Antipleonasm Analysis]].
* I can see many of these have been answered while at work.
** I really do want a button now.
* Footnote heavy. Cool. Why?
* There's a ton of technical work and [[hlexical]] reasoning in here.
* I have not spoken as much to my interlocutors, or so it feels.
* There are some humdingers in here.
* My frustrations bleed onto the pages.
* This hasn't been as fun to read, but it has been a worthy use of my time. It's intense.
