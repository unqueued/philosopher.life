title: 2018.12.18 - Prompted Introspection: Love Is Not Like

!! Complete this sentence: Love is?

Yeah, I did that: [[2017.12.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Love is...]]. I'll tell you what it isn't: it isn't //like//. Appraisal and Recognition Respect, Darwal, you old dog, you. 

Love is [[The Right]]. Like is [[The Good]] and [[The Beautiful]]. Fitting standards are particularized to the context. Love requires agency, and it's a commitment to a principle. It can be mushy, but it usually isn't.
