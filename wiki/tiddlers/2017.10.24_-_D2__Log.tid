Sorc MF Hell Mephisto runs. Got her to level 88. Ding! Picked up an Arachnid's Mesh and a Bul-Kathos's Wedding Band on top of a bunch of other stuff for my collection and crafting.

I'm looking into Uber's. My brother asked me about it, and I said I wanted to wait. But, in a sense, I really don't have to wait. I have two characters capable of doing this if I put some thought into it (maybe even more with a day or two of leveling).
