!! How do you define love?

This is a classic question for my life. I have tried so many times to define it. I don't know. I believe love sits in contrast to like. I have no doxastic control over what I like, at least not in any direct way. I can't choose to like or dislike something with a commitment. Love, however, is the kind of thing we choose. It is a commitment. Being the kind of person who loves, of course, isn't something we can simply choose to immediately become either. I think there is a difference in intentionality and the employment of wisdom between like and love. I can't quite put my finger on it though.

Love is seeking the best for X given what you take to be the standard of the good for X. It's a pursuit of the flourishing or the good of an object (individual or corporate, simple or complex, and so on and so forth). Unfortunately, I can't define "The Good" for you either. 

Fuck.
