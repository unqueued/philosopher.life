title: 2017.08.02 - Pipefitting Log

I arrived early, and I finished off [[Revisionist History: S01E03]]. I decided to start writing a bit about what I thought. A lot of this isn't new to me, but the presentation is excellent. It puts me in a good mind frame for the job, I think. 

Jaye and Bull showed up. I gave Bull my keys and went back to the car to write. I'm not starting until Bull does. Jaye was late. It was fine though. Bull doesn't give a shit, I think. 

Setting up honestly takes half an hour. I'd say an hour of my day is devoted to setting up and cleaning up. I spend at least 1.25 hours on break/lunch. We don't really even start until 7:30 most days, so cut another 30 minutes off. 7 and a quarter hour of actual production in a 10-hour shift. 

In any case, I prepared us well last night. We walked in with plenty to do. We got a good chunk of the fitup and some roots in before the break.

I tried calling my children on break. The connection was exceptionally poor today. I will try again. Bull takes very long breaks. I'm going to take breaks as long as he does. For the second day in a row, I'm eating my veggie lunch for breakfast. I'm hungry.

We got our blankets for welding. They make me itchy. We duct taped up them up. I went topside and loosened the flanges a bit. The pipes went right into place. They aren't perfectly plumb, but your naked eye can't tell. They look beautiful to me. I'm legit proud of myself. 

We tacked them up, and Jaye had to go. I found out later he packed up all the welding equipment for me. What a bro!

Bull was topside working on Room #4's flanges. Room #4 has double coils for both Supply and Return. The top Return has a nipple on it. I'm going to have to do some tricky shit to make it work. Bull and I talked about it. He wants them staggered, not parallel/squared with each other. I asked him what he meant by staggered. He explained, and I said I got it. He then continued to explain.

In this case, when I say I understand something, he doesn't believe me. He continues to walk me through various interpretations of it. I know I've made mistakes, but I'm trying to think of a point that would cause him to behave this way. 

We talked while we bounced from missing ladder to missing ladder on the roof. We had to call the helper, Kevin, to raise a lift up to us. We ran across the Superintendent. We have the same name, and we always say, "hey X" to each other with a smile. 

Bull and I shot the shit for a while. We did so twice today. He's really easy to get along with, even though we are very different. He's quite tolerant of me thus far.

I told Bull about the tools I'm getting. He seems interested in trying the quick fits. He also told me to be very careful about my tools, since they can be stolen. He has had 10 welding machines stolen over the decades. Lol!

I basically took a break, packed up, and left afterward.

I need to cut a hole in the wall on #4 and take measurements. Jaye has to finish the in-position welds in #1. We also need to mount the L-spools in #2, and afterward Jaye can tack and weld.
