title: 2017.08.15 - Pipefitting Log

Arrived 6:28. They left as I arrived. She came back at 6:40. She is the wife of the general foreman or supervisor, Chesterton. We talked. Mostly her at first. I then let it out that I am educated and worth moving up, and she was telling me about a position they are trying to fill.

Mull assigned me to grind for our welder. Never have taken a galvanized layer off a pipe before. Was 40 feet in the air off a scaffold. Getting all the tools there is at least half my work. I need to get to a point where I don't even have to be asked, I just know what to do.

Halfway through we had to stop. No one checked the scaffold that day. From now on, I need to check if it has been checked. It is my ass on the line. I check the scaffold anyways, although I don't know what to look for. We waited for a few minutes while I put my leg stirrup extensions on my new harness. It started to rain and we went on break.

The acetic acid aerosolized into the air burns my throat, lungs, and makes my asthma go off. Tough shit.

At the end of the day, I volunteered to help use the jackhammer 60ft in the air to chip concrete. It was grueling. Absolutely crazy hard. It was the hardest I've ever physically worked. My arms were dead. Bear, my companion, doesn't like me. Ironworkers are the tough guys on this job, and they love to give people shit. Some of them are proud of running others off the job. I hope to take up Chris' view: who gives a shit what they think? Do what you are going to do, and ignore them.
