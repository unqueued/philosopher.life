title: 2017.01.28 - Pipefitting Log

Nash and I put together a more complex object before it was time to do our weekly cleaning of the shop (apparently, the teacher designed the schematic just for us, the "upperclassmen" hadn't seen it before; they said that Nash and I were likely going to do a lot more work than they did). Getting the right Level and Plumb is not easy with our materials. Our teacher is a stickler too. We had a pipe very slightly off, but we passed the test.

I clearly need more practice on the construction of these objects. I do not have the sense of knowing exactly what to do when, where, and why. It will be a road to travel to become virtuous at this.

I've finished the OSHA-10! What a time-consuming process it was. I think I might also take the optional assessments just in case. I don't want to have to do this again. Plus, there is a Welding and Cutting assessment that may be important to know.
