title: Rationality

It's reasonable to be reasonable. Circularity problem. We take reason to be an article of faith. That reason rules ethics is a matter of faith. If it doesn't stand up to reason, then we shouldn't see it as ethical. Reason is the best guide for knowing the world, what we ought to do, who we are, etc. Reason should rule each of us. Kant was right about defining people as reasonable. He was wrong to think that people are reasonable. He was wrong to think that much of who we are is reasonable. We are not the "ends" we are meant to be. The reasonable part of us is the part we should shape ourselves to be. The reasonable part is our "true self" our authentic identity (matter of faith). We are disfigured and poorly integrated and poorly constituted selves. We must guard our reasonable self and banish the others. Reason is often the source of happiness (making good utility calculations), but reason can also make us said (e.g. understanding human nature, or realizing the world is ending). 

Reason destroys faith. Faith is the unjustified, basic, foundational assumptions we take up (they can be complex sentences, but we just assume those sentences are true without any further explanation or justification). Reason tests faith. Reasons inspects it, criticizes it, interprets it, appreciates it, redeems it, gives us explanations where we thought there weren't or shows there weren't reasons when we might have thought there were.
