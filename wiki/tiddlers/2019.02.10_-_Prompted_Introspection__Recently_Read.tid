title: 2019.02.10 - Prompted Introspection: Recently Read

!! Tell about an article or book you read recently.

Ugh, I don't care for my previous answer in: [[2018.01.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Reading]]. Unfortunately, I'm falling well behind in my [[Deep Reading]] and [[Link Log]]. There's a lot of [[FTO]] work to do, and my days are filled to the brim (or so it feels). I have, of course, been reading articles. I've just not made judgments out loud about them yet.

Alright, this caught my eye:

Okay, why load it from a 3rd-party? Fuck that. Even after that is solved, I've tried network activity monitors in my browsers, and I wasn't able to get it working, imho. I'm so good at this.

Still, the idea is fascinating. Part of me has no problem with this. I sometimes wish my browser would start "looking ahead" (as I would say in Rubik's Cube lingo), but with privacy and anonymity default (to whatever extent makes sense). The bandwidth problem might be unfortunate in some cases, but the privacy issues perhaps moreso. I need that hover just for asking myself what that object really is.<<ref "2019.02.17">>

Ultimately, I want a browser with reasonable defaults and access to fine-grained control. Perhaps this can be MLed. This is an arms-race. Browsing the web safely, quickly, and flexibly requires too much knowledge. We must be responsible together though.

Also, `/fingercross`, I'm hoping I still land my second rickroll in [[EFF: Cover Letter]]. It's a bold move, cotton.
