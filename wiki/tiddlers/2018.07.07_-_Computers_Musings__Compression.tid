title: 2018.07.07 - Computers Musings: Compression

```
Jul 07 15:57:35 h0p3 lighttpd[6869]: 2018-07-07 15:57:35: (plugin.c.131) Cannot load plugin mod_compress more than once, please fix your config (we may not accept such configs in future rel
```

Derp. Fixed.

Also some other fiddling, and `sudo chown www-data:www-data /foo/bar` still didn't fix a permission error I found.

Still failing the basic test:

`curl -sILH 'Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate' https://philosopher.life/ | grep --color 'Content-Encoding:'`

FF Dev tools shows compression, as does http://www.gidnetwork.com/tools/gzip-test.php.

Remember [[2018.04.08 - Computer Musings: Letsencrypt]]? So, my cert expired...which is weird because:

```
Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/philosopher.life.conf
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cert not yet due for renewal

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/fullchain.pem expires on 2018-09-06 (skipped)
No renewals were attempted.
No hooks were run.
```

Yeah, so I've still screwed something up. This is annoying. 

`certbot revoke --cert-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/cert.pem`

`sudo apt-get autoremove --purge certbot`

`sudo apt-get install certbot`

Ran through [[Walkthrough: LetsEncrypt + Lighttpd]] without the permissions. Fuck it.
