title: 2019.06.10 - Prompted Introspection: Holiday Question, Again.

!! What is your favorite holiday? Why?

Oh, I have older answers in [[2017.09.05 - Prompted Introspection Log]] and [[2017.06.11 - Prompted Introspection Log]], but they still check out.

I think most holidays are the result of capitalist and nationalist processes which are designed to exploit us and unjustifiably enforce conformity (which is hardly to say enforcing comformity is never justified in any possible case). I despise appeals to tradition. I'm fine with people being silly and stupid to some extent, and having a holiday would be a fine time; except, I don't see most people trying to be wise. I regularly am told by people they aren't interested in the truth. I think they would rather ignore reality and go on holiday every day. Obviously, I'm fun at holiday parties.
