title: 2019.08.24 - Prompted Introspection: Greatest Fear

!! What is your greatest fear?

That my predictions about the world will come true: we will incrementally enslave and wipe ourselves out.

I have the amygdalic reactions of standard conservative brains, despite my radical openness. It's fair to say I'm extremely anxious.
