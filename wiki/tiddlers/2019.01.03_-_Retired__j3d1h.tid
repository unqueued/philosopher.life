!! About:

//My daughter, Saint Alia of the Knife, drink deeply of the Water of Life.//<<ref "1">>

<<<
Computers bootstrap their own offspring, grow so wise and incomprehensible that their communiques assume the hallmarks of dementia: unfocused and irrelevant to the barely-intelligent creatures left behind. And when your surpassing creations find the answers you asked for, you can't understand their analysis and you can't verify their answers. You have to take their word on faith.

* [[Our Daughter: The Designer of Happiness]]

My daughter is brilliant<<ref "2">> and absurdly knowledgeable for her age.<<ref "3">> She is a profound First Born child. It's sometimes scary how much she understands, what she designs, and who she really is. The complexity is enormous to me! I ripped the veil away, forcefed her fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, innocence lost, and baptized her with fire. I have cursed her. I fear my ferocious intensity has damaged her in many ways; I pray I haven't permanently dimmed her beautiful light. I cannot atone for my sins; I can only hope to restore her. 

I'm here to help her make lemonade, navigate those deep waters, and efficiently achieve eudaimonia through persistently wise labor and self-programming. I must guide this prodigy with empathy, to accept her wherever she goes, and to show her that her pain and effort are meaningful and ultimately worthwhile. I hope that one day she will forgive me for not being the creator she needed. Despite my failures, may she succeed in virtue of herself.

Few children upwardly escape the socioeconomic status and privileges of their parents in the neverending era of hypercompetition and corruption. Perhaps even fewer cross the postmodern threshold with integrity. I do not know if anyone succeeds in navigating the whirlwind of our world. However, I believe my daughter may be an exception to the rule. Behold my broken and perilous mentat //Bene Gesserit// princess. Whether she quietly hides in plainsight or transforms into a fierce alien empress, I stand behind her.<<ref "nm">> 

I don't know who she wants to become, but I hope to lay the groundwork for her. I hope to help her: become her own master, to guide herself, to be exceedingly rational in her executive functioning for the sake of happiness. I may not pass into the promised land, but she might. I cannot see the end of the road, but I will give her the means to wander that desert. I seek to equip her for an enemy I do not fully grasp, for a goal-chain that I cannot envision, for a life beyond my understanding.

As beautiful and powerful as she is, she still has plenty of holes in her game. I am convinced, however, she also has the tools to fill them. I am of use to her, at least for a while yet.<<ref "4">> Admittedly, it is not a question of //if// she will surpass my theoretical and practical knowledge, only a matter of //when//. I have the fragments, but she may actually wield them. Depending on her choices, one day she may surpass me to a point so far out of even my reach that we will experience an epistemic singularity, with her on one one side and me on the other, a memetic barrier-seal so profound I will be unable to understand what she sees.<<ref "5">> 

Long ago, I told her I did not have the answer to the //moral question// and that no human does. I have seen it, naked before me, humanity has failed. It is simply faith. I'm here to help her succeed on her own terms on either side of that great divide. The tools, explanations, and justifications I give her serve her on both sides of the wall, and when I can't do that, I give her two stories to think about. Again, my goal is for her to be happy and enable her to define herself. I hold my breath; let us hope we succeed.

* Equip her with the cognitive socialization instruments, and give her opportunity to practice and develop her affective social skills.
