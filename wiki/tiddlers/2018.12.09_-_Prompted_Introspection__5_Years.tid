title: 2018.12.09 - Prompted Introspection: 5 Years

!! Where do you see yourself in five years?

Getting my daughter into college. Having a shelter, food, and drugs to live on. Writing my wiki (i.e. masturbating furiously). Taking walks with my wife. Annoying [[others]]. I hope my [[monster]] will be sick. I would love to have learned more [[Nix]] and [[Rust]]. It would be amazing to have more work done on [[The Original Position]] and [[Outopos]]. As weird as this may sound, the past year has taught me not to predict too much about my future, especially not on this wiki (I realize this is a perspective that poor people often take up). I know the world could become radically worse (that is my prediction), but I also recognize that I have no idea what is in store for me on this wiki. I don't know if I'll be transformed, but I hope I am happier and the world is a better place.

[[h0p3]] of 5 Years from now (you are me, [[4DID]]) if you are reading this, I want you to know I love you. I'm doing my best for you, and I [[hope]] you can look back and agree.
