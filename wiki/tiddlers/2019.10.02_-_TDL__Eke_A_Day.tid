* Wrong, you will wait one more day to shop. There are still fresh fruits and vegetables to finish off. Let us leave ourselves nothing.
** Shop tomorrow.
* I'd like to see a [[Link Log]]. You should get back to it this month.
* Keep up the 2-hour limit. 
** Build a self-healing tank, the classic Paladin/SK concept.
* Clap Strawman Adorno with what it means to prioritize [[The Object]]. Vorrang des Objekts my ass.
* You probably don't have what it takes (:P), but I'd like to see you fast more often.
* Make sure the repairmen come from the bathroom.
** Make sure to tell them the carpet got pwned.
