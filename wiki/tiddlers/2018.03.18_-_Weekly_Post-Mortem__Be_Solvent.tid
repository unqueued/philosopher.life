---

* I did my best to get the kids to do their schoolwork. It was a rough week in that respect. It took a lot out of me.
* I did continue calling my brothers. At this point, I'm recognizing the possibility that my brother AIR may end up not speaking to us again.
* I did work on my wiki projects.
* The walks with my wife were wonderful. I wish we never stopped walking.
* IRS issues are almost entirely resolved. The hard part, at least, is over. 
* Healthcare was selected. I tried finding a dentist. I need to schedule that.
* Lease is set, but I still need to talk to them.
* I did a shit job searching for employment. =(
