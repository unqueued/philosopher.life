* Papers, paint, dryer, phone, vehicle
* I have a fuckton to read and write, as usual.
* [[subl]] looks like it has a thousand machinations I need to construct, but it clear room for growth I don't see in the wiki. 
** I'm relieved we are going with a more out-of-the-box solution for now.
** It may not pan out, but I'm glad we are trying.
** Your children need to become adept minmaxers with their text editors.
* The house is getting dirty again, and the carpets need mowing.
* Keep up the [[Fitness Routine]]. You slipped a couple of times. No backslidin, yasumbitch. It's good for you, good for Mushu, and good for ya whole family.
