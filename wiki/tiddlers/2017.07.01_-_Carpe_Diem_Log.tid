title: 2017.07.01 - Carpe Diem Log

* I woke up late. Fireman time. My wife didn't stay. =(
* I got a bite to eat, talked, and my brother showed up.
* We screwed around some, and then we played some DND.
* Eventually it got late enough and everyone was hungry, so we went swimming and grilled out.
** It was nice.
* We came back and played more DND. 
* Afterwards, we chilled. 
* I talked with L&K about Final Fantasy 14, and my brother slept. 
* I wrote in my wiki, and I watched some league. TSM got stomped.
* We watched Lucky Number Slevin.
