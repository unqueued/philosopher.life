title: 2017.12.10 - Prompted Introspection Log: Parent-Child Activity

!! Tell about one of your father-daughter/son activities.

Playing Diablo 2. We don't actually play in the same instance, not yet. We are playing solo games and talking about it. We ask questions, think about it, and enjoy what we've got. I like sharing games with my kids. In fact, this is part of my larger school project with them to share [[The Great Human Conversation]] with them, even for video games.

It's been fun to see them going through it the first time. It's kind of magical. I like being able to discuss how to improve characters and think about the game with them. I'm going to help them through solo play for a bit through at least nightmare mode, maybe on a couple characters. Then, I'd like to play hardcore mode with them. It's very high stakes though, so I don't want them to do it until they really know what's at stake and how to play. Of course, that's assuming they even want to (which they might not). In any case, I'll be happy to even share the basis with them.

Also, I need to find activities they enjoy doing on their own that I can join them in.
