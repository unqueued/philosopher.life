Yesterday and today, your phone going straight to voicemail again, like it used to.  Phone dead?
MAY 9 10:03 AM
Sorry, phone died right at the end of work. Plugged it in.
MAY 9 10:03 AM
How was your day yesterday?
MAY 9 10:04 AM
Wanna talk?
MAY 9 10:04 AM
Sure.
MAY 9 10:04 AM
You gotta call them, cause I just tried before sending that first message

MAY 9 10:15 AM
Do you need one  of those tables, btw?
MAY 9 10:16 AM
It's definitely the prone I, y, t that does it
MAY 9 10:16 AM
Nah, put you face and shoulder along the couch or bed, and do it one arm at a time
MAY 9 10:17 AM
He actually recommended one arm at a time anyway, just so you can focus on making your shoulder blade do the first part of the movement
MAY 9 10:18 AM
If the shoulder isn't lock back, you'll just use the same muscles you always have to cheat the movement
MAY 9 10:18 AM
Oh, you have one of those tables... you were asking if I wanted it? Lol
MAY 9 10:19 AM
Yes.
MAY 9 10:19 AM
Seems like it might be useful for your back.
MAY 9 10:20 AM
Plus, handjobs.
MAY 9 10:20 AM
Lol, I have always wanted an actual bed with the hole like that to sleep on
MAY 9 10:21 AM
Like an actual mattress
MAY 9 10:21 AM
Actual
MAY 9 10:21 AM
Lol
MAY 9 10:21 AM
No doubt!
MAY 9 10:22 AM
This makes me wanna try MDMA again
MAY 9 10:22 AM
No visuals at all, just pure body-feel
MAY 9 10:22 AM
I would very much like to try MDMA. Many autistic people and PTSD sufferers speak highly of it.
MAY 9 10:23 AM
I thought you did try it?
MAY 9 10:23 AM
MNA, not even close.
MAY 9 10:23 AM
Ah
MAY 9 10:23 AM
Or, I take it isn't close.
MAY 9 10:23 AM
They are supposed to have similarities
MAY 9 10:24 AM
It probably was, your heroic dosage first used have probably tainted what you view as a "strong enough" trip
MAY 9 10:24 AM
Wow
MAY 9 10:25 AM
Word salad
MAY 9 10:25 AM
#mylife
MAY 9 10:25 AM
Lol
MAY 9 10:25 AM
Damn dude, I wanna go on a 3 amigos trip again
MAY 9 10:25 AM
That was a special moment
MAY 9 10:26 AM
Yes, it was!
MAY 9 10:26 AM
My whole body is sore, lol.
MAY 9 10:52 AM
Problem is the kids make me laugh too much while we are working out, so I'm losing my  concentration while grunting.
MAY 9 10:53 AM
Remember that little music video/ride on my vr?
MAY 9 11:53 AM
Yes. It was gorgeous.
MAY 9 11:54 AM
Imagine being in there while high and tripping,
MAY 9 11:54 AM
I bet it was wonderful, lol.
MAY 9 11:54 AM
And imagine what it's like when you realize for the first time that there is a special pause feature in the video that halts movement and music, but not other visual effects
MAY 9 11:55 AM
Now THAT was a trippy feeling lol
MAY 9 11:55 AM
=)
MAY 9 11:55 AM
Thought all the acid would be gone from the little paper through evaporation, figured I had waited too long to mail it.
MAY 9 11:57 AM
Nope
MAY 9 11:57 AM
I am glad you took it. I think you've needed it too.
MAY 9 11:57 AM
I set aside the bigger portion when I did my first part of this paper, weeks ago
MAY 9 11:58 AM
Turns out, your piece had all the fun juices.  This is way stronger than the first hit I did
MAY 9 11:58 AM
Atleast as strong as our 3 amigo trip :grinning_face_with_star_eyes:
MAY 9 11:59 AM
But, without the visuals.
MAY 9 11:59 AM
Hmm, I would say its like 8/10 the visuals of the first trip now
MAY 9 12:00 PM
Noice!
MAY 9 12:00 PM
But 12/10 of the physical pleasure/movement pleasure
MAY 9 12:01 PM
You know to activate it this time around.
MAY 9 12:01 PM
That took forever to type and it barely makes sense
MAY 9 12:01 PM
Lol, makes good sense to me.
MAY 9 12:01 PM
You got your foil crinkles going?
MAY 9 12:02 PM
Oh lol
MAY 9 12:02 PM
Took so long to understand what that meant
MAY 9 12:02 PM
I thought you meant tin foil hat conspiracy
MAY 9 12:03 PM
Lol. I think you are experiencing time dilation to me, like what you think is taking forever isn't taking so long. But, I assume you are rabbitholing.
MAY 9 12:03 PM
Like thinking through molasses
MAY 9 12:03 PM
That is the phenomenology sometimes. =)
MAY 9 12:03 PM
Yeah, major time dilation
MAY 9 12:03 PM
Novel experiences slow the feeling of time down.
MAY 9 12:04 PM
Speaking of "rabbit holing," I'm gonna go burrowing again
MAY 9 12:04 PM
rofl
MAY 9 12:04 PM
/salute
MAY 9 12:04 PM
In my butt...
MAY 9 12:04 PM
I gotchu
MAY 9 12:04 PM
Do you tho
MAY 9 12:04 PM
REDACTED
MAY 9 12:04 PM
L PM l
MAY 9 12:05 PM
Lol
MAY 9 12:05 PM
Fuck lol
MAY 9 12:05 PM
Lol
MAY 9 12:05 PM
The autocorrect to REDACTED is funniest shit ever
MAY 9 12:05 PM
REDACTED
MAY 9 12:06 PM
Laters luv, guv,bruv
MAY 9 12:06 PM
peace, love you =)
MAY 9 12:06 PM
Hahaha, yeah real dwigt moment potentially lol
MAY 9 12:07 PM
Lol!
MAY 9 12:07 PM
That made so many synaptical connections
MAY 9 12:07 PM
Also, I dumped all the Intro graphic novels into our resilio sync.
MAY 9 12:08 PM
Going from "Trying to understand why you put that there" to making a joke that references a similar situation feels like a miles long mental leap lol
MAY 9 12:09 PM
I feel like the next einstein because of my joke lol, seriously
MAY 9 12:09 PM
That joke was right on the money, lol.
MAY 9 12:10 PM
There is a fun recursion when some part of your mind is able to look at another part of your mind with respect and even awe.
MAY 9 12:10 PM
Slow motion inward looking eye
MAY 9 12:10 PM
I think openness to making the parts of yourself respectfully cooperate with each other is part of unifying ourselves as a whole.
MAY 9 12:11 PM
Ever look at your reflection closely to see if you can see yourself blink?
MAY 9 12:12 PM
No, but I that check of staring myself in the eyes in the mirror often enough.
MAY 9 12:12 PM
I do that*
MAY 9 12:12 PM
It's an interesting experience to do it for like a full minute. Intense.
MAY 9 12:13 PM
Drugs like this slow you down in way that you can see your self reflection blink
MAY 9 12:13 PM
I might argue that is a hallucination.
MAY 9 12:13 PM
Your inward turning eye
MAY 9 12:14 PM
Not looking at a real mirror
MAY 9 12:14 PM
Oh! I see.
MAY 9 12:14 PM
Now I get it. Yes!
MAY 9 12:14 PM
Conflating the image of seeing yourself visually with perceiving who you really are
MAY 9 12:14 PM
That's the recursion of it.  You are looking inward, and it's a whole third man argument... from there
MAY 9 12:16 PM
Not to be super annoying, but whoa.... lol that all made so much more sense 10 seconds ago
MAY 9 12:16 PM
Do you mean to say you see two parts of yourself you get to see connecting from a 3rd party perspective?
MAY 9 12:17 PM
This is a helluva trip
MAY 9 12:17 PM
I'm fascinated, btw.*
MAY 9 12:17 PM
Exactly, you see it from the third party perspective, then that is you watching something watching from the outside perpsectives
MAY 9 12:18 PM
Nope
MAY 9 12:18 PM
Cant hardly type well enough to do this lol
MAY 9 12:18 PM
Lol. I'm interested in your introspection and the phenomenology of looking inside yourself while on LSD. I think the drug is well-suited to it.
MAY 9 12:19 PM
Yep, like a less painful k
MAY 9 12:19 PM
Awesome!
MAY 9 12:19 PM
Ok, I'll be back
MAY 9 12:20 PM
oops!
MAY 9 12:20 PM

MAY 9 12:20 PM
The slight delays from your wiki loading feel like an eternity atm lol
MAY 9 12:22 PM
It's getting bigger and takes longer to transport, no doubt.
MAY 9 12:22 PM
It will get slower each year.
MAY 9 12:22 PM
It should be performant enough once you load it though.
MAY 9 12:23 PM
Just a heads up, don't watch the trailer for It 2 while high on lsd... yikes
MAY 9 4:54 PM
Jesus, lol.
MAY 9 4:54 PM
Uh, go to a happy place.
MAY 9 4:55 PM
Anything else standing out to you while on your trip so far?
MAY 9 4:57 PM
Jerkin was the best I have ever had it.
MAY 9 4:58 PM
Does LSD may VR porn real? Like, fo' real for real?
MAY 9 4:59 PM
make*
MAY 9 4:59 PM
Nah, just better
MAY 9 4:59 PM
Dat euphoria
MAY 9 4:59 PM

Played beat saber until I was this sweaty.
MAY 9 6:53 PM
Beat saber sounds like a euphemism for jacking...
MAY 9 6:53 PM
Lol.
