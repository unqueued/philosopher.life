title: Personhood

//[[Transworld Identity]] has to be solved first. [[Phenomenology]] must also be threaded.//

Personhood is the ground of moral accountability.

* All persons have identities (they are personal identities), but not all identities have personhood.
* The identities of persons have forensic normative implications.

Conditions of moral agency:

* Self-reflective consciousness
** Person Y's consciousness at t,,2,, is identical to a person X at t,,1,, just in case Y's consciousness “can be extended backwards” to X 
*** Relational account of identity: persons at different times are identical to one another in virtue of some relation(s) between them

 On Locke's view, I am appropriately concerned, both for the past stage of myself to whom my consciousness extends, but also to some future person — me — to whom my consciousness will extend

my ownership of certain actions is what makes me accountable

I deny that one absolutely cannot be held responsible for actions they don't remember performing. It depends.

In other words, I can remember only my own experiences, but it is not my memory of an experience that makes it mine; rather, I remember it only because it's already mine. So while memory can reveal my identity with some past experiencer, it does not make that experiencer me. What I am remembering, insists Butler, are the experiences of a substance, namely, the same substance that constitutes me now.

“not punishing the mad man for the sober man's actions, nor the sober man for what the mad man did” 

consciousness changes from moment to moment, and we do exist beyond the present moment

Problems:

* memory does seem to presuppose personal identity, and so cannot constitute a criterion of it.
*  identity is a transitive relation, while memory isn't, so the latter can't be a criterion of the former. 
* identity seems to persist through the loss of memory: it's hard to believe that I would cease to exist were I to undergo amnesia.

I have a quasi-memory, q-memory, of some past experience just in case that experience occurred to someone and my memory of the experience was caused in the right sort of way by the experience I now remember. Regular memory, then, would just be a subset of q-memory (applying to ordinary instances when I was the person to whom the remembered experience occurred), and q-memory could be the relevant relation incorporated into the theory of identity in a way that avoids Butler's objection.

memories fade, every stage in the life is linked by a chain of overlapping direct memories. What one can then insert into the criterion of identity across time is a continuity of direct (q-)memories

The Psychological Criterion of Personal Identity: X at t1 is the same person as Y at t2 if and only if X is uniquely psychologically continuous with Y, where psychological continuity consists in overlapping chains of strong psychological connectedness, itself consisting in significant numbers of direct psychological connections like memories, intentions, beliefs/goals/desires, and similarity of character 

I cannot be responsible for the actions of some person if I'm not the inheritor of that person's psychology.
