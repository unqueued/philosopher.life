This is a standard, enlightened, neo-liberal reactionary position. There are plenty of directions to go with it, and countless graphs to spew in favor it. Apparently, it's obvious to anyone looking to uncover the truth that the world is currently better off because we centralize [[power]] through quasi-Enlightened capitalism. Officially recorded violence, starvation, and mortality rates have improved. Surely, only capitalism could bring us this progress while socialism and pursuits of opportunity or outcome equality have surely and primarily detracted from the progress we've made and could have made.

Oh yes, I concur, doctor. Many aspects of the world and our lives are radically better than previous generations, centuries, and millennia.

Prices on entertainment, access to what was previously thought of as luxury, and explosions in technology have opened worlds for us. Of course, having a mobile phone in the contemporary world is a necessity, not a luxury. If fully participating in politics means having a certain amount of income, wealth, education, social connections, or status, then to that extent, these are necessities not luxuries (until we decide to structure society with more efficient methods of achieving citizenship for all). 

I have no problem sacrificing for the global poor and future generations either. The maximin principle demands a great deal us. The most [[power]]ful must progessively sacrifice the most. It is obvious. We are morally obligated so profoundly that we really don't own ourselves much at all.

Measuring happiness is generally a radical problematic (though perhaps possible, I have no idea what is required), but imagine a world in which there is on average a steady increase of total global utility at the rate of 1 util per week. Surely, we may call this progress by definition if increases in utility are the only measurement we are taking. But, of course, anyone with an ounce of virtue or deontic fiber in their moral reasoning will recognize the futility and sophistic sleight of hand embedded in such an argument. The motivation, the why, the how, and the justification of the means are non-trivial moral problems. Even utility monsters are obvious casuistic counterexamples. Note, of course, that consequentialists must look at opportunity costs and admit that merely demonstrating just any [[dok]] of progress is hardly the claim that it's the [[right]] [[dok]] of progression. 

Thus, this issue is not whether or not we've made progress at all, tout court. Rather, it's about whether or not there is a historical justice which passes the [[ROG]] account. The legitimacy of the process is part of how we define the success of progress. Moreover, why should we think the Elephant Curve, the centralization of power, trickle-down economics, and constructing society on the assumption that psychopathy and egoism can be redirected to serve the public good better than any other option? Why is no other possibility feasible? [[ridtyawtr]].
