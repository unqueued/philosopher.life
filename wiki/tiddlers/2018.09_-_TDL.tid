!! Audit:

* I clearly struggled to accomplish my goals.
* I feel like I'm spinning my wheels here, and even my stated goals demonstrate some monotony.
** Is this really a bad thing, especially for an autist?
** Don't I really crave having a schedule I can rely upon?
** It's not like I didn't get a shit ton of work done either!
* I'm been extra concerned with [[FTO]] here. It certainly takes it out of me.
* Goodbye my lovely watermelon season! I hope to see you on the flipside, homie.
* I'm glad that I'm doing something a day in advance. 
** Often things have to change, but that's okay.
* I like being able to immediately answer to my wife what we are having for dinner. 
* I did plan to help friends and family this month.
* I had a string "Grinds" lol, but it really was grindy.
* [[TDL]] appears to give me very little vision, but it makes me feel like I have a remote idea of what I'm doing the next day. 
** I probably need my wife's critique at this point.
