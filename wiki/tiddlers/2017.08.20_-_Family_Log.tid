* 1uxb0x
** You have been even better about staying in touch with us on the phone.
** Several times I asked you to listen to your sister, and I know that isn't something you enjoy doing, but you did it anyway. Good job.

* j3d1h
** Several times you took the lead on cooking dinner. We really appreciate it.

** This week when the car broke down, you took charge and let me collapse. It felt like we were both drowning and you pushed me up instead of yourself.
