Truth serum is delicious. 

I adore the troublemaker Weasley scenes. I like how their skills are there when it matters to them. It gives me hope.

The dive into Snapes' memories is fascinating. I would also be curious to see an analysis of false memories, distortions, confabulations, rationalizations, etc. I can see why Snape is pissed. 

McGonagall is snappy, aged Hermione with every ounce of integrity. I adore her honesty and integrity in the auror scene.

Comparing yourself to your father is a wonderful thing that never ends.

I think I probably look more like Hagrid than any of the other characters, but more like a tiny version of him.

"Very well" - Inq Squad is the S.S.

Umbridge's Rule of Law failure is delicious. Though, Hermione's argument is not good.

Life valuing is a hard problem. I actually do think there are lives more valuable than mine after [[The Original Position]] and [[The Golden Rule]] Calculations.
