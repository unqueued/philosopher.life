title: The Tree of Eudaimonia

//This the sketch of a fictional story (duh). I'm brainfarting around. I literally dreamed this, and as I slowly woke, I continued to think about it. It's all a confabulation, but I know it's a fiction (so that makes it a safe place to explore).//

Imagine a tree whose fruit makes us truly happy to each of our perfectionist specifications (and modifies our specs insofar as our initial specs would contradict the happiness of ourselves and others), and it does it the only way that is possible: It controls us. 

Since consciousness is scientifically an illusion, we are mere observers, it is conceptually possible for us to appear to be autonomous to ourselves while actually having lost it to some mind control agent. It is deeply manipulative, but with the right telos (our happiness) and the instrumental means to achieve it. It is a unique drug. It transforms us. It heals us. It is a panacea. It is a utopia-generator. It makes heaven on Earth. 

This is an experience machine we can hardly say no to. 

* Unhappiness
** We need backstory. Sadness. Ailment. We need to know unhappiness in the world, the sources of it. 
** Maybe we follow a few individuals, a few groups, a few nations, etc. 
** Pull them heartstrings.
* Deus ex machina: the seed arrives
** Meteor, teleportation, or other "out of thin air"
** Genetic modification turned serendipitous accident
** An omniscient, omni-benevolent, omnipotent AI has computed it and builds a single seed
** etc.
* The Garden: It germinates, cultivates, and spreads
** It is planted (very minimal requirements here), for whatever reason. 
** A treeplant rockets out of the ground like Jack's beanstalk.
** Maybe it has fly-away spores. Multiple ways to spread (e.g. the seeds survive our digestion).
** Many treeplents make a garden.
* Adam and Eve: the Fruit of Eudaimonia
** They enter the garden.
** Perfectly spherical, high-liquid content fruit with "unique" Dune-Spice-like smell and taste factor to each person.
** Temptation and the inevitable.
** Pleasure upon contact
** Immediate transformation.
* Memes of a Fruit: the tree takes the world by storm.
** Like a virus, it spreads through our minds, bodies, and lands.
** We are perfectly happy.
