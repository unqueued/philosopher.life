title: 2013.01.24 - Skepticism: Descartes Reading Notes

Perhaps there should be a distinction between knowledge we have about the external world and apodictic knowledge. Maybe Descartes’ standard of knowledge is simply too high. 2+2=4 is apodictic to me. That I am experiencing anything at all is apodictic to me. The claim that what I am experiencing corresponds to any real, physical objects independent of me is not apodictic. But, perhaps knowledge isn’t necessarily apodictic. This seems pretty fair. For example, a priori knowledge, like 2+2=4, may just be really special. Knowledge drawn from experience might be weaker, not apodictic, but still be knowledge..

Another approach might be to think that we could also have invisibly prefaced knowledge. Take the claim:

“There is a computer in front of me.”

Instead of saying that is what I know, perhaps what I really know is:

[If there is an external world, and I’ve not been deceived or hallucinating in any way, and my senses are operating correctly, etc., then] “there is a computer in front of me.”

I might not be terribly conscious of this or even articulate about it. But, that might be what knowledge is really like regarding things in the external world. This antecedent is a list of things I take for granted often, so much so that I may fail to recognize it or really think about it when I make claims to knowledge about the external world.

At any rate, even without correspondence or this conditional kind of knowledge, I can still make claims like:

“I perceive a computer in front of me.”

That I do know, apodictically at that. Exactly what I mean by a computer, what it means to be in front of me, etc. can be spelled out in terms of further explication what I’m perceiving without really attributing existence to the computer or even a physical space in front of me.

Why can’t we doubt our beliefs which count as knowledge? Can’t we suspend judgment, a kind of doubt, and rework and infer our way back to that judgment, and recognize that judgment as knowledge?

The isosceles triangle example reminds me of Universal Introduction.

Does the externalist have a decent answer to the Cartesian problem? Or, is it simply too coincidental that it just so happens to be the case that your supposed belief turned out to be true?



Even if the fact that sometimes judgments based upon our senses sometimes fail is not enough to show that any judgments are senses are not to be trusted, I still don’t know in which cases I judgments count as knowledge and which don’t.
