Good. Working on the wiki - the wiki is always the best explanation. Teaching the kids. Reading and writing as usual. Applying to a job for which I am qualified (imho), but I'll never get (still, gotta try! ;P).

You are so good at just sit and read or write all day that would drive me crazy I don't think I can do like that all day long everyday.

High praise, thank you. Yeah, the habit is ingrained into my character at this point. It's who I am. I can see how most people would not enjoy it.
FRI 11:28 AM
Yeah!  I am one of most people.
