title: 2017.12.15 - RGM Notes: Multi Social Network Distribution

Doesn't seem like it to be too hard to rig this up to distribute it automagically. I can just keep embedding it in different social networks, repos, etc. 

I'm not 100% sure I want to do that. But, I may end up want to. Think about it.
