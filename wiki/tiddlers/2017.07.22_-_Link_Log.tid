** Our technologic overlords have come to show us the futurological way! /s - Why is this not something we pay for publicly (outside of the academic component)?

** I don't have anything to say. It was just interesting.

** The representations inside neural networks are already that. This, of course, takes it to another level. Fascinating. I believe it will be a huge problem. Constructing things you cannot understand is dangerous.

** At what point do they fall onto the personhood spectrum?

** I had no idea. I assumed MAC randomization was enough.
* https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/jul/11/how-economics-became-a-religion
