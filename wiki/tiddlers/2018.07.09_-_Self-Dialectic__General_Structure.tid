title: 2018.07.09 - Self-Dialectic: General Structure

[[Root]] is the representation of the idea of this wiki to me in an artistic way. It's also very practical. It isn't what I generally use those, as that is found in the tabs of the sidebar. I have to build a human readable directory structure/search tree that is increasingly salient.

My sidebar is actually how I navigate my wiki. It's how I reason about it in a structural, modeling kind of way. I see the timers and possibilities of timers in my life, and I must elegantly and efficiently hack together the right sequence of choosing which timers I will listen to and why. I need a model for improving my heurstic for building those phenomenological and computational timers in my life.

[[Hub]] is where I {[[Focus]]}. I'm constantly updating it. 

I'm looking for functionality in my aesthetic. Beauty must lead to The Good, it is The Right insofar as it does. One cannot be overly concerned with their purpose, they can only be wrong about how they ought to be concerned about it (and how they apply it in practice, insofar as action is abstracted away from our beliefs).

{[[Dreams]]} is laden with hopes and dreams, ofc.
