title: 2019.09.21 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Insulting

!! Respond to the following gem:

The one measure of true love is: you can insult the other.

Obviously, that is not true as it stands. First, [[love]] is a different concept than you've been preaching, but I agree that insults are not only a measure or a test, but clearly part of demonstrating, practicing, and choosing to [[love]] in many contexts. Second, we all find ourselves in contexts in which insulting [[the other]] is not the loving thing to do. Often, insults are not useful to [[the other]], and that must give us pause. I suppose it can't be just any insult either. Depending on the context, with a handful of words, [[k0sh3k]] can stab me in the heart enough to end my life. Her words have the right to damage me.

Reciprocal [[love]] generates some kind of trust. I don't want to violate trust, and moreover, I accidentally insult people without even trying (I have one of those very punchable faces). When I intentionally insult, I aim to be surgical when it's true to eliminate justified backfire (it's dangerous, and I [[hope]] to be a man who can be safely held accountable for practicing the awful end of [[The Golden Rule]]), otherwise, I aim to be over-the-top insane (literally the worst things you've ever heard in your entire life) or affectionately annoying (preferably with hugs). I take [[h0p3: Toxicity]] seriously; there are justified and even [[beautiful]] forms of insults.

Insults spend social capital and emotional spoons. Yes, [[love]] grants enormous credit to the beloved. Just because you can doesn't mean you ought though.
