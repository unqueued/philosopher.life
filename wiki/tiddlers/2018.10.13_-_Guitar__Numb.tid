title: 2018.10.13 - Guitar: Numb

There is a numbness coming over my fingers now, lol.

I should continue to focus on //The Banks of Iverness// and //The Rocks of the Brae//. They are sounding remotely respectable. 

Got some thick books for my left foot because the classical stance is simply better for reaching. I like resting my chin on the guitar as I play too; the vibration is soothing.

//Iverness// has a sick climax into denouement (don't know the word for it, /shrug). Guitar feels simpler and plainer than the piano, and I find that enjoyable. Peaceful, elegant mourning.
