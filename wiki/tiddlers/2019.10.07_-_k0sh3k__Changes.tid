It's tough to see a branch of inferences and memories disappear in you. I thought we were on the same page. It makes me feel like dozens of conversations ended up being meaningless. I don't think you've understood the gravity of the problem nor your responsibility here. But, I also think you've been changing a lot. You've been super stressed, and I think there's a shift in your general perspective in life. My charitable interpretation is that the shifts in you meant pruning parts of yourself (wholly on accident there).
