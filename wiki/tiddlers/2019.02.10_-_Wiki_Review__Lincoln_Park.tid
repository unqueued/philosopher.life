title: 2019.02.10 - Wiki Review: Lincoln Park

* [[2019.02.09 - Antipleonasm Analysis: High Voltage]]
** Edited.
** It's pretty damning to me how many voices in [[The Great Human Conversation]] have so clearly pointed it out, and I just didn't take it seriously enough. I'm convinced I'm a terrible listener in some crucial respects.
* [[2019.02.09 - Prompted Introspection: Moving]]
** Edited.
** Indeed, removing the more philosophical and realpolitik work has made that log even more personal to me.
* [[2019.02.09 - Wiki Review: Chess]]
** Why do I keep forgetting the lemon juice. Why am I not being attentive in that spot?
*** It is the homestretch.
* [[2019.02.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Letter]]
** Completed.
** Congratz on the secks, sir. =)
* [[2019.02.09 - TDL: Family Time!]]
** We're not leaving the house today. Cool. We'll do it without le juice.
* [[2019.02.08 - Music Exploration: K-eep'em Coming]]
** Am I going too slowly?
* [[2019.02.09 - Wiki Audit: Signing]]
** I am frustrated.
* [[2019.02.09 - /b/]]
** Edited.
** Glad to have places to put things. I like when people write in my wiki too, and it's easy to just have any random threshing floor.
* [[TickTock]]
** Gettin' weird wit' it.
* [[Saints]]
** Neither would care for how I've said that. We don't have to agree; obviously, we don't on plenty of issues. I'm lucky to have learned from both of them. It's weird to be unable to explain to someone the flood of causal forces they initiated in you for which you are grateful. It's even weirder when they wouldn't immediately agree that is a good thing either, but that is also okay. 
*** Gratefulness is difficult to translate when it requires a translation/mapping of values in our reality maps that are deep and wide. It's easy for things like "I was hungry, and you fed me." It's harder when it comes to the fundamental contents of our identities (rather than just the conditions for them).
* [[T42T Ingroup's Overton Window]]
** I'm going to sit on it. Clearly valuable moves in there, and I'm okay that it's a wreck for now.
* [[Philosophical Nomads]]
** Maybe irrelevant. I hope it is a valuable way for me to reason. It might be.
* [[2019.02.09 - kicksphygmus: Aftermathematics There Is]]
** Gut intuition, [[PH]], not even a draft.
* [[Smalltalk]]
** Edited.
** Realtalk, yo.
