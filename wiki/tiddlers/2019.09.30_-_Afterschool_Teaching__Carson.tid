title: 2019.09.30 - Afterschool Teaching: Carson

I arrived to find our new program leader, Carson. She's Whitney's peer in a couple classes. Southern Belle, concerned with rhetoric more than knowledge (openly), probably earning her em-are-ess from the sounds of it, etc. She's sweet, and I think the kids are going to like her. I walked Carson through our paperwork and basic schedule. She was super nervous. I think that will pass quickly. It's fascinating to see Delp and Matt come to train her up right; I wonder if there will be new rules to go with new blood now. The machine continues to build itself. Let us see what my realism can do.

One-on-ones were smooth. Carson actually joined me for a bit on my suggestion that she speak with each child to learn their names (even though all the other teachers thought it wasn't a good use of her time). I'm lucky to have so many students who want to speak with me. Not much homework today (and many had already finished it). 

5TB said his ex-GF's mother is texting him all the time. I told him to speak with his parents about this. He said he told his mom, and his mom told him not to tell his father because his dad would kill him. Hrm. Yes, I see that in his biological donor. I asked him to exercise his judgment. 

She may be taking 5th grade by demand. As I said, I'll take whoever they hand me. That leaves me with 6th. Cool. I adore having some sanity here. 6th has my worst offenders, but if I don't have 45 students to handle, they can be managed.

With so few students, it is easier for them to generate a quiet privacy. I love not having 45 students trapped in the zoo prison with me all at once. We actually connected for an hour. They turned off all the lights, shut the curtains, and we played PG truth or dare through some phone app. It was fun, and I'm glad I had the chance not to be the asshole.

Of course, Whitney eventually dumped her children with me to go play in the office (shockingly nothing accomplished), and Carson brought hers to me since there was more training. I had the opportunity to speak with many of my students though. I'm lucky to know many of these human beings.

7C and I talked about the word liberal. He asked me what I thought about them whiny liberals. I didn't take shit, we walked through the etymology and the historiography of the concept in a lightning bolt, and I implored him to empathize and escape his filter bubbles.

//Don't Stop Believing// came on, and my children lost their shit. I do not understand, but I adore it. They sang and danced, I hummed and did my autistic sway.

My namesake said: "Live justice. Rock justice. I love justice." Me too, dear. Then she went to play in the pretend game with 5AO and 5SD. Rock on, girl.

Plenty of Bob's Burgers verbal brawling. Some of it reasonable. Humility is not easy to achieve (I am, ofc, the best at it).

We now have enough people to allow more children to attend. Good!
