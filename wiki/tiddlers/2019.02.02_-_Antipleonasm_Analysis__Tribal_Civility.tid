Only [[The Moral Law]] defines property rights, and it is, by and large, neither Lockean nor Capitalist. The word "civil" is about as much of a weasel word as "natural" in ethical discourse. You can beg the question however you wish by smuggling your preferred conclusion into its definition, as part of the premises (how we map the semantics of the predicates in the first place).

It is obvious there was plenty of room for everyone. That might not be a popular opinion, but I think [[The Golden Rule]] clearly would require it. That doesn't justify this Randian insanity or the atrocities in the material dialectic. 

Racism is a tool for distracting a portion of us from admitting the more fundamental class power struggles. I'm all for having appropriate outgroups, and thus: fuck her and her gaslit tribalism.
