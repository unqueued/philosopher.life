!! What do you consider the best year of your life so far, and what made it so great?

This is tough. My years at Berea were amazing. My first year of marriage was insanely wonderful. My first year getting my MA in philosophy was sick, and the same for my first year getting my PhD in philosophy. This year seems to be yet another one of those (school is always that way?). These were all very stressful years, but incredibly rewarding too. If I absolutely had to pick one, it would be 2005 from start to finish.

* I had some of the most important classes I ever took.
* I started dating and married my wife.
* I graduated.
* I played Everquest with my family that summer.
* I had my first child that year. 
* I got my first professional job as a teacher that year. 

Let me say, it wasn't perfect, but it was pretty amazing. There were a lot of transitions that year. That said, I was also naive and filled with hope when I shouldn't have been. I still hadn't learned what the world and people were really like. I did not understand my plight. Ignorance is bliss. In time, I hope the truth will overcome that apparent fact.
