title: 2018.06.22 - Deep Reading: Infinite Jest

Joelle's life sounds meaningless, and of course, I will have the unpopular opinion: she seems to have a lot of options for building meaning.

I don't understand the placement of the Chronology of Subsidized Time.

Orin and Hal's relationship is weird. They are talking past each other. Everyone is losing their fucking mind in this book.

The microwave suicide is insane.

The sadness that emerges from the "Infinite Jest," the comic absurdities, is enormous.
