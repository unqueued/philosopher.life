What's your daily grind look like today? How will you be spending you precious freetime?

Work and school. Same as always. And I don’t really have free time these days. :joy:

I think I’m gonna squeak fight club out in between classes this week because finding a solid two hours to watch it is becoming problematic.

Between work, school, and social life, it's narrowed down, I take it.
