title: Childhood

I have nothing from this time period except a handful of artifacts, such as my fabled bunny blanket (which I still use from time to time). All I have are my and others' memories about it. My goal here is to give an explanation of my childhood. A sketch of my past would be useful. It can be filled in drop by drop.

Like Dennis Reynolds of IASIP, I fear I'm forced to compose dossiers of my family in order to give context to myself.

* My First Family
** [[h0p3's Dad]]
** [[h0p3's Mom]]
** [[JRE]]
** [[AIR]]



* 1985-1989 - Chicago, IL
** I was conceived because my mother is allergic to latex. 
** We lived in the ghetto Humboldt park region. Apparently, it was very rough. 
** My parents finished up at Moody Bible Institute. We eventually moved to Louisville, KY so that my parents could attend Southern Baptist Seminary. 
** My dad found a job making good money as a problem-solver/maintenance/fixit man at an IP-rights violating manufacturing facility.<<ref "1">> Many years later, he would regret not having stayed at the job to save money. Their financial planning was poor, and my mother was never very good with money until much later in life.
** My brother, [[JRE]], was born in the same hospital as I was about 17 months later. He apparently didn't breathe for a full minute after birth. It was the longest minute of my parents' lives.
** I don't remember anything of Chicago at this age. I passed through it many times growing up, and I have fond memories of the ethnically divided areas of town. The food was always amazing.
 
* 1989-1991 - Louisville, KY
** We technically had lived in Tennessee for a month (and possibly Texas too) before this. I do not know the timeline.
** I remember a bus that my evangelical grandparents (from my dad's side) left to us or something.<<ref "2">> They went to convert those poor USSR communists in Russian during the 90's, lol. 
** I remember my mother's mother visiting on my 5th birthday. We had a slip'n'slide.
** I remember finding needles in the dumpster behind our house.
** Our car caught on fire; the neighbors took us in to watch Bambi while the firefighters took care of it. We had a Yellow Ford Escort and $500 run down blue Toyota with 200k miles on it. 
** I attended a private school for a short time. It was the last serious education I received until college.
***  I puked creamcorn there, and I could never eat it again without being forced to.
** I befriended my bully, and we went to McDonald's. I came back with a happy meal clear bucket that I used to catch fireflies that night.
** I remember being chased around the bed peeing my pants as my dad came to hit me. This happened several times.
** I remember my dad working late at Holiday Inn as a maintenance man of some sort. We'd pick him up very late at night. 
** My parents thought they escaped evangelicalism, but really they were just moving to less insane variants of it.<<ref "3">>
** My youngest brother was born here. The tubes were tied.

* 1991-1992 - New Haven, KY
** My dad got a job as a pastor of a Baptist church. I don't think he appreciated that they could vote him off the Island (hence part of our move to Methodism).
** My mom was finishing school. She slept very little.
** We lived in a parsonage close by. The church was small. I remember candles and drinking a Pepsi that had cigarette ashes in it. 
** We were right next to a train station of sorts, and our next door neighbor was a conductor I believe. We got to see the inside of the train once. 
** Our neighbors were our babysitters after school. 
*** I saw my first tit on a poster in their house (a young man's room that I wasn't generally allowed into). 
*** I tried to make pop-tarts, but left the foil wrapper on. Sparks in a microwave.
** I remember a very serious bike accident there.
*** I had serious anger issues with my bike and legos, IIRC.
** My teacher would put on lipstick and kiss kids on the lips if they misbehaved.
** I was a badass who wore shades and a Michael Jackson glove going to the chalkboard to solve math problems. I wrecked everyone, punk. ;P
** They had me do the morning announcements (which they normally didn't let first graders do).
** I remember being told not to touch any stamps in the area because someone had been lacing them with LSD. It's a damn shame I never got a hit. 
** I felt those weird chest pains at this age.
** I remember going to someone's house without permission after school. It freaked my parents out. I didn't understand why.
** There were serious parties in the lot/field in front of our house (right next to the train station) every weekend.
*** Speaking of which, I've always lived at least within earshot (if not line of sight most of the time) of a train.


* 1992-1997 - Mannsville, KY
* 1997-1998 - Red House (Richmond, KY) & Wilmore, KY
* 1998-2003 - Elizabethtown, KY
