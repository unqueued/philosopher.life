Everything I say or write can and will be used against me.

Sometimes this wiki feels like the desert of the ideal.

Teach the selfish State of Nature capitalism of the signals and voices of your neurons and their emerging structures to cooperate in pursuit of [[The Good]].

Effective class discussions were often about learning how to change your teacher's mind, and in this sense, you'll have to craft your teacher as well.

Understanding how information relates to itself is a complex task.

I'm trying to capture as much of the lightning in a bottle as I can in my rabbitholing; I want to come back with a representation that is uniquely useful for informing my heurstics model.

I'm trying to wisely have my conscious Daseinic emergence be used to facilitate the peaceful and increasingly coordinated communication and cooperation of my non-conscious processes.

I was in my miscommunication schizotypal mode trying to communicate something rational. My daughter was wondering when "reckless" isn't "reckful," and I realized she confused the homonym of the root, and was talking about "wreck"...I tried to say it's because the word doesn't have a "w" but instead the words that came out of my mouth were "It's because the doesn't have an 'R'..." and immediately my right hand signaled drawing a W in the air, and I realized my mistake, correcting myself. My left side of my brain controls the right hand in some critical way. It is a reasonable assumption that my left side was trying to communicate to my right side with a visual clue-correction.

Build the "DELIBES - Lakm√© - Flower Duet" sublime moments for yourself in your wiki. Feel the freedom of being owned by The Sulime, The Good, The Salience, The Significance.

Your wiki is a mouthful of mouthfuls.

Reaching out for the truth is reaching out into the unknown for the unknown.

I should consider bugging people on a timer with my wiki in some cases...That's weird.

I'm unvertigoifying the unending desert inception

I cannot define the ineffable because that's what the ineffable means (is defined as).

Ah, yes. Do not defend or explain your own argument; just rhetorically point to the authority. It is true: sometimes that is all we can feasibly manage. Maybe there is only one interpretation of Kant which everyone shares, or you mean exactly what Kant does, or Kant could not have been wrong about the nature of the transcendental (or the illusion in particular).

I was legitimately interested in your fleshed out opinion. There is plenty of content wrapped up in what you said, and I don't think it was a dumb question. It does seem reasonable to ask for your particular representation of a technical and arguably still controversial worry (we're still responding to Kant). It seems reasonable to rehearse your view on and use of Kant here. Perhaps I'm wrong. In any case, if you don't feel like answering, just be kindly honest (it's not that hard) or silent.

Maybe I need to work on my sneering and "tbh" one-liners.
