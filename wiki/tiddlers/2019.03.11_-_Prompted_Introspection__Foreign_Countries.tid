title: 2019.03.11 - Prompted Introspection: Foreign Countries

!! What foreign countries have you been to? Which ones do you want to go to?

Mexico, Canada, Thailand, Japan, South Korea. Can't say I stayed anywhere long enough to say I know much of anything on this one. I feel like a foreigner everywhere.

I'm not much for physical travel given the costs. My time is better spent in other ways. Of course, I'd love to have a year to visit the world. Still, the aesthetic is simply not enough. Further, traveling often overtly feels like mere simulation as I skim a surface designed to extract money from me. I want to travel in conversations, books, computers, and my mind.
