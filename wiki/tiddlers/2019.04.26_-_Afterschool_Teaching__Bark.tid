title: 2019.04.26 - Afterschool Teaching: Bark

Matt is done with student teaching. He was so relieved, and I'm happy for him. 

The chess club came again. They took what students wanted to play, and surprisingly, Delp was annoyed there weren't more who were going to play. I took those who had homework and anyone who wanted to come to the library. Whitney and Matt decided to dump everyone on me instead and go play in the office. Eventually, they were annoyed that the library time wasn't being used the way they preferred, so they took a handful of upperclassman to watch a movie. Cool.

I helped students with homework. People are banging it out. I love it. 7Hm received quite a bit of tutoring from me today. He's lazy but smart. He made good leaps of logic, and I hope to encourage that. This was the first time I've seen him work the solid hour. He lied to me about what his mom expected, and I called his bluff. I'm disgusted by the number of lies I'm told.

The 5th graders are becoming sassier. 5NP2 and 5NP both spent a lot of time sitting with me. I even yelled today, rofl. It's like training dogs. 

My namesake and I had a very long conversation about the nature of her honesty. Like me, she says everything that comes to top of her mind, and she is almost never wrong. I adore her, but almost everyone else hates her. They are mean as fuck to her, and I walked her through some extreme examples and some of the situations which played out to drive home when she should hold back. She does nothing wrong in being honest (in the same way that you don't deserve to get raped because you wore a short skirt, though I didn't use that example), but explained how she should consider being more prudent with her outspokenness; I don't want her to experience undue pain unless she really knows the sacrifice.

I had small conversations with folks, and I got some students to help me clean a bit. 

I spent a good deal of time walking and reading with bits of interactions in the gym. Nobody wants to read. It's like we are here to do everything but that, except when it comes time to take a test which makes the school some money. I fear I fail my own children in this respect too. Fuck it. I'm retarded here too. I'm kinda feeling a bit [[hope]]less about it, even though I'm not allowed to.
