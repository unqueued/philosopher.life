title: Reality Map

//This page is junk//


For better or worse, we are not typical people. We spend a lot of time and energy shaping ourselves. We care about our desires and beliefs, and we often have the balls to act on them.<<ref "1">>

We have deeply systematic views of ourselves and the world around us. Our subjectively generated reality maps have differences, but we obviously agree on many facts together. From a mile-high view, our reality maps share structural similarities. I believe our many regions of our reality maps tend to be intricate, richly detailed, broad and deep, exceedingly existential, organized with a high degree of relevance and value-seeking, and structured with an internal coherence and logical consistency which average people do not have. 

I have failed to convey this point many times (and I may be failing again). I think our reality maps, including our beliefs, desires, choices, attitudes, and modes toward the world, really do define and constitute much of who we are in important ways, especially since we have such intense innerlives.

Being a well-constituted, integrated self.

In an inescapably circular way, in exercising our reality maps, I believe we prize our reality maps. That is because we have sacrificed for them, because we need them, because we know how high the stakes are, because we know how important they are to achieving the ends we have embedded in them. If our reality maps are part of what constitutes who we are, then zealously cultivating our maps is a supreme demonstration of how much we care about our identities and lives. Essentially, our reality maps are well-motivated, strongly justified by our evidence, and (in a way, unfortunately) complex enough that it is difficult to convey to and share with others. That is to say, you have distinct, thoughtful points of view. Even if I don't agree with you, I appreciate your reality maps. Much of who you are makes sense to me. 


I have had this schism in my reality map. The world has crumbled around me (and I with it). I value my experiences and understanding of Christianity. They allow me to interpret the world in important ways.



Let us be clear, this is not a denial of objective reality. It is a Kantian recognition of our inability to directly access it though (sometimes thought of as the unknowable “thing in itself”). We have evolved to be creatures with innate categories which dictate how we organize and think about the world around us; again, we are innately biased at this genetic level. Sometimes we recognize it as common sense (color-blindless highlights that fact so clearly for me), but other times it can be difficult to accept.

<<footnotes "1" "I think of us as systematic contrarians, skeptics, true believers, and people willing to go against the grain (INTJ). Ah, but of course, we must step back in humility. As Mom has pointed out to me many times, everyone thinks they are the exception. But, it is a fact that there are exceptions on the epistemic bell-curve. To some degree, I think we are exceptional. We are weird and alien to this world. Let's own it and use it to our advantage.">>
