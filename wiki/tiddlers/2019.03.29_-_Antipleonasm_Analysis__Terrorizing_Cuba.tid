title: 2019.03.29 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Terrorizing Cuba

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Cuba has probably been the target of more international terrorism than the rest of the world combined and, therefore, in the American ideological system it is regarded as the source of international terrorism, exactly as Orwell would have predicted.
<<<

This is hyperbole. I cannot speak to the claim accurately enough. I have a difficult time defining terrorism separately from unjustified violence. Even on standard conceptions, the Palestinians may still quite easily hold the title of woe. I agree, however, that Cuba has been subject to profound unjustified violence, especially because it is both a strategic geographic location and symbol. It is the center of many crimes against humanities committed by centralized power in the name of cold war, but most clearly in virtue of capitalism. 

Obviously, most Americans continue to be evil enough not to fight for the truth enough to eventually arrive at even a remotely realistic semblance of the truth. Even some of the smartest people I've met lack the integrity. 

Saints Orwell and [[Chomsky]] made outstanding observations and predictions. I owe them both a great deal. We are lucky to have such brazenly honest humans in our midst. I hope to live up to what is ideal about them.
