Hey! Happy belated Halloween :):):) I hope yall had a great time. 

And more importantly, how. on. earth. did you make that face thing??
5 HR AGO
Magic!
5 HR AGO
and alcohol, as my chillun point out to me
5 HR AGO
surfing around for unicode
5 HR AGO
lots of neat things in it

[Te​​​​​​​​​​st Te‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌st Te‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍st] [Test Test Test]
5 HR AGO
Those first set of "Test" words have 14 characters instead of 4.
5 HR AGO
zero-width characters are neat
5 HR AGO
You can pass messages invisibly hidden inside of text...even Reddit, twitter, etc. will keep it for you there.
5 HR AGO
Whaaaaaat? How does the other person receive or access the hidden message?
5 HR AGO
[[j3d1h]] wrote a tool to convert messages into zero-width characters and embed them (and convert back...I use an extension to show me).
5 HR AGO
They have to be looking for it.

There is a thing called "clearsigning" which is basically where you take some text, hash it (a 1-way trapdoor function in math that produces a unique fingerprint of the source material), and then cryptographically sign it. That signature is provided alongside the source material as a "clearsignature" that makes it so that you can come back demonstrate that you were the original author of the message.
5 HR AGO
[[j3d1h]] has been helping me create clearsigning inside of zero-width messaging. Basically, it's a watermark with a signature that nobody is looking for.
5 HR AGO
Someone can copy and paste the text, and signature will follow along with the text.
5 HR AGO
You can also come back and prove that you wrote it, if you wanted to.
5 HR AGO
So if someone copy and paste from an email or something like that? You could prove that it came from YOUR email. Or an email you wrote, rather.
5 HR AGO
yes!
5 HR AGO
Man that could be so useful in ownership disputes and things like that.
5 HR AGO
It can also be used to covertly send messages over Reddit titles (or whatever medium) and maintain an identity that isn't tied to any specific account.
5 HR AGO
I've seen steganography used in other places that can be neat too.
5 HR AGO
So someone could have a constant presence in a forum without necessarily having a single account?
5 HR AGO
There's an old trick where you can append a file to the end of an image.
5 HR AGO
Yes!
5 HR AGO
A constant and secret presence. A community can pass messages in public settings.
5 HR AGO
Anyways, I've seen people attach mp3's or other files to the ends of images and pass files in the open that way (on image boards, etc.).
5 HR AGO
A lot of places will process the images to strip it of exif data and recompress it, etc. I found a tool that will enable your data to survive that process!
5 HR AGO
My wiki, maximally compressed, fits inside of ~5.4MB, so it can be transported inside of images as well, lol.
5 HR AGO
I think you'd like the business cards [[j3d1h]] and I made as well: http://live.philosopher.life/#Business%20Cards:%5B%5BBusiness%20Cards%5D%5D
5 HR AGO
we have a pseudonymized set and IRL info set (depending on who we are giving them to)
5 HR AGO
They look even better in person. That QR code is nifty, imho.
5 HR AGO
oh, one other neat thing, your browser converts unicode characters that are "similar" in appearance to the official lettering, so you can do stuff like this: https://𝕡𝕙𝕚𝕝𝕠𝕤𝕠𝕡𝕙𝕖𝕣.𝕝𝕚𝕗𝕖/
5 HR AGO
Your entire wiki being able to fit inside an image blows my mind. And those business cards are incredible. She has a really good artistic eye!
5 HR AGO
Anyways, I'm geeking out. What have you been up to?
5 HR AGO
Have you traveled back?
5 HR AGO
I enjoy when you geek out.  You always introduce me to the most fascinating things! I'm back in Houston. I actually just got home an hour ago or so. As stressful as everything is, it's really nice to be back home and spending time with family for an extended period of time. I'm going to try to fit in some furniture renovation while I'm at home. Maybe even attempt to build a bed *fingers crossed!*
4 HR AGO
Nice. =)
4 HR AGO
You were painting furniture. You doing staining?
4 HR AGO
How far are you going into building the bed?
4 HR AGO
Image attached to message
It depends on the project. The furniture renovations so far I've painted bc most of those pieces are a mixture of real wood and laminate, so it's easier to just paint everything the same color rather than trying to match a new stain to the old laminate. Anything I'm building from scratch I just stain. I leeeeeeeeerve the color of dark stained wood. And the smell of new pine or cedar furnitire. Yum.

Heres a picture of the bed I'm going to try to make.
4 HR AGO
I'm gonna build the whole thing. The plans swear it's a good beginner project.
4 HR AGO
I dont have much fear bc I'll have dad to fix all my mistakes :joy:
4 HR AGO
That would be awesome.
4 HR AGO
haha.
4 HR AGO
My brother was considering building something like that, but I don't think he could agree with himself on how he wanted it done.
4 HR AGO
I love that you are jumping in there.
4 HR AGO
Being unafraid to make mistakes (which, I do not claim you will them) is noice.
4 HR AGO
I also love the look of dark stained wood.
4 HR AGO
I've been making an effort to teach myself to enjoy mistakes the last little while. Not ENJOYING them, but not being worried over them and enjoying the journey that INCLUDES mistakes, if that makes sense. Especially in crafts like sewing or woodworking, I learn just as much from mistakes as doing it correctly. Like if I a piece of fabric too short and it doesnt sew right, I can see how it doesnt fit and why the measurement they give is the right one.
