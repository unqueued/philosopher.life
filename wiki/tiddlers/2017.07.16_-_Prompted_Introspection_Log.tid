!! Do you have a catchphrase?

I don't think so. I have many phrases that I use often. Maybe I have catchphrases for particular kinds of problems, contexts, situations, etc. 

I think my {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]} and {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]} pages provide the best examples of my catchphrases. There are principles and axioms I take to be the core of who I am. e.g. [[Know Thyself]]

My daughter pointed out to me that my general catchphrase might be:

<<<
What's the worst that could happen?
<<<

Tempt fate, yo. Give God the middle finger.
