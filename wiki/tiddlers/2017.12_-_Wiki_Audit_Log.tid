!! Audit:

* I triaged so fucking harder. I swear I was recursively triaging throughout the month.
* Good fucking job, mate!
* I am very pleased that I took time to create new content. It was sometimes the only way to even find a way to organize what I had previously had.
* I'm not sure about the SO content. It's there.
* Post-mortems were clearly valuable.
* I got caught up in that {[[Vault]]} thicket. It's really a beast that I keep putting off. I have so much to fucking do though.
* {[[About]]} has been quite a monster, but it has been a blessing to see it evolve.
* The [[Wiki Audit Log]] rabbitholed me into writing content for {[[Principles]]} very often!
* I tend to avoid using the same title.Title twice in other logs, but not this one.
* You can see the waves. I pushed and dove. 
** I'm really proud of myself. This shit is hard. That doesn't mean I couldn't have done a better job, but I'm not going to beat myself about something that I should instead celebrate. 
* I got pretty pissed at myself throughout this month. That's okay. Keep going.
