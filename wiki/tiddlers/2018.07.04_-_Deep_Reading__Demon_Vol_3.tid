title: 2018.07.04 - Deep Reading: Demon Vol 3

The author's dedications to his wife as hilarious. He's a troll.

The power and existential crisis of the demon starts to //demon//strate itself more forcefully in this book.

Meeting up with the original scientist was kind of what I expected.

The deux us machina of the agent is ridiculous. 

The eidetic memory is a joke and not used correctly.

Their code is dumb for people who should obviously understand how to engage in real crypto, even by hand!

The coherence of the world is falling apart. Still, it's interesting. There has to be an element of suspending one's belief in this series.
