title: McManus: On Marxism, Post-Modernism, and “Cultural Marxism”

https://merionwest.com/2018/05/18/on-marxism-post-modernism-and-cultural-marxism/

God damn, that is a crisp rehearsal! =)

<<<
Post-modern authors, his thinking goes, simply broadened Marxist ideas about class oppression to encompass all forms of social interaction. 
<<<

I actually do attempt to see these connections as best I can. Peterson, unfortunately, mixes some truths and half-truths in with the rest of his lies.

<<<
Were he alive today, Marx would likely have responded to the claim that he was a post-modern theorist with sarcastic ridicule.
<<<

Seems like it. I would desperately love to know what he'd think in our shoes. I'm not skilled enough to conjure the man. Ultimately, I take the goal of those who decry "cultural Marxism" is to deny Marx's obvious accuracy in describing the world by denying postmodernism they underhandedly conflate with it. The focus on the STEM as somehow separate from the Ends of the Humanities (purity, even in empiricism, obviously belongs to the philosophers ;P) has not helped.

<<<
What I want to observe is that ontologically and epistemically Marx is 1) highly committed to a theory of truth: dialectical materialism, and 2) believed that this truth can be uncovered by getting past ideology. 
<<<

There we go. Though, I'm not 100% in love with (2), but I still can't seem to uncover what is really meant by idealogy (which itself seems ideological).
