title: 2017.09.13 - Pipefitting Log

Arrived for the last bus. Lots of new people. Tina, of course, plays the nice game well. It is part of how she has climbed.

I've started stretching a few seconds ahead of everyone else so that Dave will know what to do next. I want a thorough and complete stretch in the morning

I've decided to stop voicing my thoughts to these people so much, at least about the job itself. I'm not convinced it is worth it. 

I did much of nothing except the usual basics this morning. Chris-M wants me to draw the lines on the supports as if we were going to make a new one. I understand finding centerlines for the fitup, but I don't see the purpose in the other. Chris couldn't answer my question. Perhaps it is busy work.

!! Break!

I do not gather with the masses in the smoking section. I miss many important interactions because of that.

Our saddles aren't cut right, and they are too long possibly. We are going to refabricate them. Yay! 

I spent hours prepping them. After taking my measurements, I can say they are poorly made.

I need to ask Charlie for the formula for calculating saddles.

!! Lunch!

I did very little. I did fire watch twice, but Brandon-M "saved me" by getting another fire watch to pull double duty. 

I did some bolt tightening on a riser, and I did some grind work on squares that will hold the clamps on the riser in place. I showed Brandon what good grinds looked like on this galvanized plate.

He also "showed me off" to his dad by demonstrating that I had memorized the torque rating on for the Victaulic. Uh, wtf?

!! Break!

Finished the grind. Screwed around otherwise.
