title: McManus: A Critique of Jordan Peterson

https://merionwest.com/2018/06/03/a-critique-of-jordan-peterson/

I've not actually seriously taken a dive into his work. I'm judging the book by its cover through hyperreading. I don't have time to go through his insanity.

<<<
This comes across as more than a little hyperbolic and arrogant.
<<<

You are being too kind. I laughed when I first saw that line before. I agree that hyperobjects have this problem. I consider it part of the postmodern condition that we are knowingly drowned in too much information, meaning, etc. Just how big the big picture is turns out to be overwhelming. There is a way in which his words could be interpreted as having some humility in them. I think he's being gnostic and using a standard cult-leader play. 

<<<
He believes that conservatives tend to psychologically veer towards favoring order and tradition, while the left veers towards favoring chaos and transformation. 
<<<

That is a biased way of stating the truth. There's something correct about it, though I'm not claiming he wields it appropriately. It's fair to say he's hyperbolic in how he fleshes these out.

<<<
Peterson believes that societies require both tradition-minded conservatives and creative progressives to remain balanced.
<<<

Balanced [[irwartfrr]], sure. The Golden Mean, however, sometimes leans very heavily to one side in a given context. Balance and moderation are problematic concepts. Insofar as dialectics are required for virtue, I can agree to some surface, non-hyperbolic variant of Peterson's claim here.

<<<
Where they become imbalanced, as in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, societies become increasingly totalitarian or anarchic. 
<<<

Capitalism and imperialism do seem totalitarian and anarchic. It's like I can agree to some surface claims he makes, but I go in a very different direction.

<<<
 the leftists pushing for unbalanced chaos are “collectivist” identity politics activists guided by radical post-modern neo-Marxist philosophies. 
<<<

I can't say I'm always a fan of how other people define identity or what's important about it, though Peterson is strawmanning and demonizing. The denial of "collectivism" is another way of saying we shouldn't actually give a shit about each other or take each other's ends to be our own in our calculations of [[The Original Position]] (i.e. [[The Golden Rule]]). He can fuck off.

<<<
Jordan Peterson is concerned about the ascendency of the post-modern left because he sees it as eerily reminiscent, even inspired by, the collectivist philosophy of the Soviet Union. 
<<<

You are being realpolitik kind here. That is not his real intention, though it may be his stated. Mind you, I don't have a problem with ad hominem in all contexts; I take virtue theory seriously enough to accept the move.

<<<
 Peterson is concerned that this even more radically “collectivist” philosophy is very dangerous and will lead to the formation of a “vast” and totalitarian bureaucracy that will oversee and police our every actions, right down to the way we address one another. 
<<<

So, I think Leftists should be cautious about how to avoid the centralization of power [[irwartfrr]] while still somehow maintaining the Rule of Law. The Criterion of the Law as voting must be materially decentralized in an automated fashion (it's our only shot). I'm also fucking shocked by the number of Leftists who support censorship. Ofc, it's clear that conservatives have elevated the totalitarian psychopathic emergence out of the human species. I have a hyperbeast to slay, and Peterson is upholding it. 

<<<
It is also why Peterson ascribes such insidious significance to campus radicals and their attempts to shut down free speech through acts of shaming, establishing prohibitions, and even violence. 
<<<

I am convinced violence will be necessary. I am radically opposed to censorship though. Peterson is correct here. He has no moral Hohfeldian right to say what he does, but he does have a political one which I must protect. When I stop caring about his political rights, I think he morally deserves to lose far more than his voice.

<<<
Petersons’ decision to blame Marxist philosophy for the appalling crimes of the Soviet Union and Maoist China is deeply problematic.
<<<

He knows how to wield classic xenophobic myths to make money, gain status, and empower his psychological prowess to build a cult.

<<<
 virtually no scholar argues that either the Soviets or the Maoists were in any way faithful to Marx’s initial theories.
<<<

Peterson's a scholar, right? lol.

It turns out there's no money in Marxism for those in power, so you probably aren't going to see much of an R&D budget put into it by developed capitalist sovereignties (though enormous amounts of money are spent attacking it).

<<<
Peterson might contest this by arguing that the root problem is the “collectivist” and anti-traditionalist philosophy underpinning Marxism.
<<<

Ironically, I see Marxism as a tradition far older than Marx (and he did too, that's his historical point). It's an attempt to change the world to engage in the [[The Golden Rule]], imho.

<<<
Peterson lazily believes Marxism is so thoroughly discredited he is apparently above actually engaging with what Marx or intelligent Marxists like Fredric Jameson
<<<

This is why I'm worried about how much you rely upon academia in your pursuit of epistemic authority. Most economists also think Marx is thoroughly discredited, and that obviously doesn't make them correct. Reactionary STEM is a real problem. Peterson is a symptom like Trump; I think Pinker is far more dangerous.

<<<
Marxism is in no way a direct precursor to postmodernism. If anything, many Marxists are damningly critical of postmodernism in all its variants.
<<<

I think idealism leads the way to a radical skepticism that eventually leads to postmodernism. Marx is part of the sequence to me. I do think he's a direct precursor, but I see pragmatic, empirical, inductive, realist, externalist, materialist points of view in Marxism that shred the skeptic's unjustifiably sky-high epistemic standards.

<<<
Why does Peterson get this so wrong? I think the answer is he simply doesn’t know much about it or doesn’t care to present a more complex narrative that would problematize his cute and hyperbolic story about the left
<<<

Too kind. Call evil what it is. His ignorance is malicious. I'm not giving him a Hanlonian pass. Virtue is knowledge. I'm going to be forthright in my paranoic interpretation of that psychopath.

<<<
This is a deeply shallow sample of the literature that makes one wonder whether Peterson has actually read many authors in a tradition he claims to understand and vilifies.
<<<

Meh. I've read very little Peterson, but nothing you've said is news to me. We have to be reductive in our modeling, inductive in our summarization and scaffolding, etc. I don't care about simply his lack of citations; I care about //why// he lacks his citations. 

<<<
When you boil it down, most of Peterson’s aversion toward the Left stems from a distaste for the style of its activists, rather than anything of substance.
<<<

No. The truth is far more evil than this.

<<<
I have some sympathy with his criticisms of left–wing activism, as indeed do other leftist thinkers such as Slavoj Zizek. 
<<<

We are paying for our mistakes here.

<<<
But he cheapens intellectual discourse when he deals with caricatures and hyperbole rather than really engaging the ideas of his political opponents
<<<

Your piece isn't aiming to be directly honest; it's realpolitik with all the curtsies and well-mannered rhetorical flourishes. Fine.
