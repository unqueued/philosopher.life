How's the hunt going?

Heard you guys had a huge D&D game too with friends and family. How was it?

Sorry, I am still missing these notifications somehow. The hunt is mostly on pause lately, but I‘m picking it back up now that things have calmed down.

And yeah! We had a session on Saturday with a bunch of people. Crazy stuff happened. I fear for our characters’ lives xD
MON 9:35 PM
Sounds like fun. =)
MON 9:36 PM
I probably get a little too into D&D sometimes, but ya know. Makes it all the more fun.

How’s your week/weekend been?

I get losing yourself in the game. I adore it.
MON 9:39 PM
I'm grinding away. m16 still isn't up. Slowly building from scratch.
