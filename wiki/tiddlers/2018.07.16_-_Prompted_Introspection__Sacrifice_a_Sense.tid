title: 2018.07.16 - Prompted Introspection: Sacrifice a Sense

!! If you had to sacrifice one of your senses (taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing), which would you choose and why?

I previousLY answered this in [[2017.06.05 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. That answer is still correct. I have not changed my mind. I would like to point out that there are more senses, and I think this is an interesting question from the epistemological perspective. Which of my senses maximize my ability to understand myself and the world, to experience what matters to most, to pursue [[The Good]] as effectively as I can? I cannot model this well enough, as usual.
