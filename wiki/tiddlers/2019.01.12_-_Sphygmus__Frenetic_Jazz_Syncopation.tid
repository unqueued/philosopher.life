Sleep. My god. I need me some.

I really try hard not to stay up this late but then I start projects and can't stop until I get everything just so...

and then trying to fix my sleep schedule after wrecking it with said project is always tough :sweat:

I've heard it's really good for depression and anxiety. I like to the my Circadian Rhythm is a frenetic jazz syncopation instead of insanity.
19 HR AGO
it can be good for that...until it rolls into the other extreme of just sleeping all the time X_x
19 HR AGO
frenetic jazz syncopation, I like that lol

now I can't stop thinking about - well, serving images over single file wiki sucks - gotta download all that MB no matter how much I GIF my images - and doesn't node load faster because it doesn't have to serve all the images at once..?? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting what node does
