My body immediately wants to take a shit within minutes of drinking even a small amount of coffee. Behavioralism, you're my only hope!

Was thinking about text-to-speech from Amazon, how fucking natural is sounds, and that is only going to improve to the point that I won't be able to tell the difference eventually. I kind of want to do the same with my voice eventually, especially some version of my voice that I hear. I don't like the sound of my voice recorded for the usual reasons, but perhaps it could be modified to sound like I hear it. That'd be a neat bonus to the wiki, to have me say it. My wife suggested I aim for a sexy woman's voice, and that is also awesome. Lady Melisandre, talk to me grill.

Here's something weird about me. Sometimes I can be overstimulated in a way that neurotypicals wouldn't be. Normal stuff will just be too much for me to handle. Exceptionally loud noise, surprises, etc. However, there are times where I feel like I actually enjoy some kinds of stimulation which others find nauseating. For example, in many circumstances, I enjoy listening to two sources of audio at the same time. As long as I'm not required to pay attention to anything else, I don't mind throwing myself into something that has a planned, habitualizable set of data streams to it.
