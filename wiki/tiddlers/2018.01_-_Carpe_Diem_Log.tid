!! Audit:

* We have had less Inform the Men time this month.
* I appreciate when I have more to say. 
* I've been pushing through Madmen, clearly. Why?
* Also, fuck my ISP.
* My sleep schedule very slowly spiraled out of control. I must tighten my grasp!
* L kind of stopped talking to me. I wish I understood why.
* I am very proud of my wife and I. We have done a good job sticking to our diet this month. No, it isn't fun not having carbs until dinner. But, it is livable, and I can see that we can do it. We will continue to modify it slowly to get this process to deliver the results we need: our health.
* Bliss heavy month. That may be part of my lack of motivation.
* I think I talked to family less this month than usual.
* I need to make sure I'm not spending time on my computer past a certain time. This is part of my problem. I need to somehow unwind without unwinding on my machine. Even my reading is not something I do relaxingly; I'm squeezing it the whole time. 
** Maybe I should exercise before bed. That sounds dumb, but it would at least be a useful way to spend my time.
* We are almost finished with The Office. We need more shows. My son has a hard time following them, so we need to stick with something fun.
* I think we finally have a system for getting schoolwork done effectively. My kids are making serious strides. I hope we continue.
* I've read some very good books this month. I'm proud.
* My head stopped hurting so much this past couple of weeks. I do not understand why.
* My children have been keeping their room and areas cleaner. They've been getting their chores done in a timely manner. This month has been really good. I think that is, in part, because we haven't had the interruptions of visitors or traveling. Consistency in these habits has really paid off. I hope I can etch it into them.
* I've seen less of Snow. I think he's giving up for now.
* I'm glad we got a VM working cleanly.
* I saw some amazing movies, and Ribbonfarm has been excellent.
* I was really sad about the NPM Tiddlywiki server. I will eventually try it again.
* I love the revamp, btw.
