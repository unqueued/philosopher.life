title: 2019.09.23 - Prompted Introspection: Boring Evening

!! What is your idea of a boring evening?

An oldie but goodie: [[2017.05.16 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. I'm generally not too bored as I keep a significant supply of objects upon which to get high. I stash it away. I prepare myself for days with limited resources. I like to read, think, and use my computer, and it's often fairly endless, but sometimes I'm too depressed to lift even a finger to explore. Usually, it's also fairly difficult for me to be bored in many cases because I'm autistic and I race on the hedonic treadmill in my own head with almost any spare time I have. It's not easy to turn it off.

Boredom, [[phenomenologically]], is likely a state in which we can find nothing available to us which appears valuable enough to focus our ray of intentionality upon. 

Boredom is also evolutionarily valuable to our survival as well in many cases. Yes, indeed, something is wrong when I'm bored, at least in an [[FO]]ed sense.

A boring evening is one devoid of any of my drugs, probably including isolation, likely for such an extended period of time that my internal reserves have dried up and my sleep debt has been paid. It's often the case I'll experience it is as a kind of [[redpill]] or a dejavu as well. I tend to analyze my boredom which can be a painful though [[salient]] experience, and it often takes me out of my boredom at the same time. It engages the [[gfwiwcgws]] machine in me, it begs the question, and I have far more confidence in such purpose these days (though still little [[hope]]).
