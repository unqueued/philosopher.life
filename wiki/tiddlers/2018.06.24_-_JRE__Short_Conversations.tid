My brother called me this morning at 9 with a joke about ICP and Raylan. Dark humor is good. We talked for a bit, and then he had to go. 

He clearly has never visited any of our wikis, but I guessed as much. He looked at my daughter's drawings, fairly unimpressed. That's fine. It's really up to her.

I tried telling him about the communications I've had this week. I'm not sure how to make it appealing to him. It's easier to just see it on the wiki. My brother has earned the right to defect for a very long time on the matter in [[T42T]]. I hope he'll change his mind.

He did call back though. We talked a bit about Ithkuil.
