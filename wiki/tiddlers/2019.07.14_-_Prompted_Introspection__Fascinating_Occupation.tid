title: 2019.07.14 - Prompted Introspection: Fascinating Occupation

!! What occupation do you think would be fascinating?

The occupations I think are fascinating aren't the sort people get paid for in capitalism. It's not that nobody wants anything like my vision (though not nearly enough do), it's that the state which would build such things is curruently an apparatus wholly owned and operated by capitalism. Decentralizing tools which would compete with private interests are verboten. Elite Capitalists from around the world are the Deep State, and hence the public services I want to build aren't going to happen without significant revolution (not merely reform). Ironically, the tooling I wish to build is exactly what enables such a revolution. It's like the network effect in some respects.

For now, I see my vocation as about teaching people how to justifiably own and be themselves in memetic and material dialectics. It is a moral quest, not always a legal one. Though, of course, I aim to construct justified Rawlsian basic structures as well. I cannot move mountains though. Being a philosopher is my occupation, but I'm still coming to grips with what that entails in my contexts, with my resources, and so on and so forth.
