!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** Yesterday, when I told you to finish the kitchen, you did it 15 minutes. Good job. I know it was not fun, and I hope in time, you can reframe it for yourself and focus your attention to always finish it in a timely manner.
** You worked very hard on your summaries, and I'm glad to see you trying.
** I think it's awesome that you are interested in computer security. That was a neat idea in your Python programming.
* j3d1h
** Thank you for making the cake this week. It was beautiful and delicious. It's awesome that you did from scratch.
** Your desk area looks really good. Thank you for taking the time to build a facility for you to practice drawing. It looks like a beautiful workstation.
** Thank you for letting me know about the cat, for paying attention to his needs. It's the sign of a good pet owner. It's good that we caught it that early.
* k0sh3k
** Thank you for giving me the recipe sheets to make the cake.
** Thank you for being willing to not watch television while our children had to work. I appreciate your sacrifice.
** Thank you for taking charge of the verbal reasoning sections of our children's education. They are lucky to have you as their teacher; I wish I had one like you.
** Thank you for trying to help me come up with compliments, for sparking compliments in my mind.
* h0p3
** Thank you for working on rust alongside me.
** Thank you for giving me the permission to work on Pythonic malware
** Thank you for taking the time and effort to make our relationship better. Walks, books, and the other work you do to bring us closer together is important to me, especially when I balk at it. A lot of marriages just fall into a stagnant groove after 12 years, but you keep working at it.<<ref "2019.03.23">>
