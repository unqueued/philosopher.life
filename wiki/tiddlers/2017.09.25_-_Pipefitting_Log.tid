title: 2017.09.25 - Pipefitting Log

It sounds like Nash, JR, and Matt are early, in orientation today. Cool. I think I will be losing my two-person table.

Today we were asked if anyone had big weld dogs. I grinned. Mine are hilariously large. We may use them.

Chris-M told Chris and me what to do. We needed to finish aligning and bolting a flange. We are waiting to torque because it requires the j-gun. He told us not to be in a rush and winked.

Chris-M told me to tell Vic how to flip and rotate the spool so that we can mount the last piece.

Chris-M went to pull measurements yet again in the pit. I offered to help several times. I helped him pull measurements near the header for the piece I was working on. The drawings don't match reality.

Chris and I read the plans and grabbed the missing parts so that we will be ready for Vic.

!! Break!

I went into the pit to take measurements. I did a bit of cleaning work with the code chisel. It sucked.

I came out of the pit and plump bobbed off a scaffold/flange on the raised 42" pipe. We need accurate information on this underground pipe. I am not sure how we will pull the angle just yet.

!! Lunch!

We pulled Kore measurements and drew lines. We talked to the pipe engineer of the project. Chris-M and he got along very easily. The engineer took Chris-M's advice.

I went back into the pit to clean. It sucked. I eventually traded it off to Chris.

!! Break!

Chris and I took turns cleaning the flanges in the pit. The bolts are coming off one of them as we chip. I hurt my thumb on one such occurrence.
