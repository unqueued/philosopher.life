!! Audit:

* I'm glad I've slowly moved to have categories. This will make it more parseable, and I can see how I've changed.
* I used to comment on every single link. I don't do that anymore. Part of me wishes I did, but then sometimes I don't think that is actually a valuable use of my time.
* I'm glad I'm slowly going through these again. I forgot just how much fucking content I've covered.
* I can see my slow blossom into Categories. 
* My links tell a rhizomatic story.
* It's an information overload just to go through one day; going through several months in a shot is insane.
* I don't have time to partake of this drug when I'm working my ass off 10-12 hours a day on top of family life. Being informed is really hard work.
** It's clear that categories came into full effect out of necessity.
* You can see my tab collections start building in the middle of the year. It's the only way to handle it.
* It's a flood. There's variety, but also a clear direction I've been heading.
* Unfortunately, I didn't have enough commentary. I wish I had more commentary. That said, even just having lists of what I've consumed is not irrelevant. Far from it.
* I can feel myself drowning and just trying to categorize the world here. It's so hard to make sense of it all, to draw conclusions in it. Categories slow the world down for me; it stabilizes the consumption and perception of the world (even if only partially).
* It clearly annoyed me that I didn't have categories for things. 
** And, of course, I understand the profound oversimplification of categorizing, tagging, etc.
* By November, I knew I was drowning in it.
* A great deal was revealed to me in my curation and hyperreading. I truly do not understand enough.
* I'm glad I introduced SCWR, as it helped me understand how to curate for the wiki at large and particular projects.
* I have no idea why I have nothing to say in my analysis. But, I'm very glad I did this work. It was crucial to my growth last year.
