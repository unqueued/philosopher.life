title: /b/: Digital Blackboard

//I use this like an extended digital version of the blackboard we keep in our living room. Somethings need to be hand written and drawn, but some are best jotted down here. I don't care about the state of this place except insofar as it is useful and I know where to throw junk.//

But, What about the children?

* Cursive handwriting reading test/book. I don't care if they can write it at all, but you need to be able to read cursive like an analog clock. It should be nearly effortless. 
* [[JRE]] July 6th
* Multireddit examples
* Back to half-and-half //Life of Fred// and Khan

[[j3d1h]]:

* Cross
* 8-bit art, and anything else you have squirreled away
* Look at automated tag mapping and hierarchical organization presentations or navigation

[[1uxb0x]]:

* Music Scripting?

* Pfft. You are cherry-picking gems. You perfect cherry picking person, you. Most, dude. Obviously, I adore these two people. Talk about trust: one of them owns the keys to my live-wiki. To be clear, I'm breaking the 3% rule awesomely though. The [[S2NR]] is Robust, sir.

* Tabs: Maps, Keys, Buttons, /b/

* Underwear
* Dryer
* Restart TW i3
* Master's master PDkey
* Crystal Data Center: Coeurl World

* Reminded of meeting a famous personality in Everquest offline. We worked together. I dropped at least 150 days played into that game, so it was cool to meet this guy (super weird, crazy smart guy, broken AF). He had just as much time played as I did, and he still never hit max level with any character. That's insane. Like, you should accidentally oops your into max level characters. I have the same problem with computing in general. 
* Cheaper to buy prefabricated fittings than constructing them from scratch (which takes far more skill and effort).
* 3d including time, right?
* Forrest Gump with computers.
