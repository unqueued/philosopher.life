title: 2018.11.07 - Guitar: Bland

Today felt bland, but I'm probably just feeling depressed. My son and I walked through our songs. He needs to work on his strumming patterns. I sent him to go do that. I think I need to have him do just that for a while. I'm worried he won't do it without me.

My daughter and I played together. The initial parts sound fine. Once we hit the showstopper where I'm literally just playing backup to her solo, we hit a snag. That song gets fast real quick. We brought out the metronome. It's clear she has some work to do. Cool. She knows what to do. Let's see her do it.

More sight-reading. Also, tried a pick again. I think my son could consider using one since he's strumming.
