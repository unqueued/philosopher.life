[[2018.01.16 - Prompted Introspection Log: Wealth or Fame]] was my stopping point. I'm going to have to pickup the speed in [[The Remodeling]]. I'm liking the cycle idea of working at the beginning of the year to cover the previous year's dated entries, and then working on permanent entries for the remainder. That is a cycle I could continue, and it would allow me to increment and not fall behind. This, of course, is still absurdly ambitious.

It's possible that I will have different approaches in the future. I might walk through the lifetime of a log.

I'm enjoying strolling through last year though. It's a sombering experience. I remember writing some of these still (or so I think). Memory exists for re-use. I still don't know what's going to be worth re-using. Part of the problem is that I collect so much data. I probably shouldn't (even if I could) try to hold onto too much. I have a hoarding problem. I think the goal is to tone it, to draw it back fittingly. The verbosity gives me a chance to pick out the [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]]. This is an opportunity. The monolith can be huge and detailed, and I must cut the [[salient]] sculpture out.

I think after the next two letters, I should start working on grafting the {[[Vault]]} material in that I've {[[Dream]]}ed of for so long. I may lose the data if I wait too long.
