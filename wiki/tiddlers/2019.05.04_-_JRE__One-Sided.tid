My brother called me up while I was on my way back home from shopping. 

I, uh, did 90% of the talking. My brother graciously listened as I outlined 3 things on my mind. He prodded and thought with me. We talked about the [[library project|Library Thing]], and I think I did a poor job of explaining that well enough; it depends heavily upon what [[k0sh3k]] wants. I talked about [[The List]], and he seemed intrigued by it. I gave an oversimplified explanation and defense of [[Recurring Patterned Redistributivism]] (itself obviously just a kernel).

My brother was feeling low energy and logged.
