title: 2019.07.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Slim Day

* Woke at 10
** Shit sleep without my eye-mask. 
* Got offspring on task.
* Got the vehicle worked on.
** Also, picked up one jumprope that was cheap and wellmade because my wife is convinced the offspring would benefit from it. I agree.
** Picked up paint too.
** Oh, and I picked up the cash we'll need.
** Fascinating discussion with a stranger.
* Grocery shopping
* Read+Write
* Walked with wife
** My male donor asked for "the privilege" of buying my offspring phones. Interesting wording and timing. `/wave`
* Got drunk and chilled
* Nap
** Heavy dreams. I woke up wanting to write.
* Setup the monitor and worked on i3.
* Read+Write
** Can't really do SC2 while writing stuff that matters. I can be a decent multi-tasker, but it depends on how much focus I really have to give. 
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 4:30. Ugh.
