Dear Phil,

IIRC, I stumbled upon [[your wiki|https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html]] on 2018.01.18. It has been interesting to see your wiki undergo the initial explosion. I can see you working not to drown in it (totally normal, imho); you are doing a good job. I'm looking forward to seeing where you go with it. I suggest our wikis have a few things in common, and that's exciting too.<<ref "2019.03.01">>

I can see you have picked [[Sphygmus]] and me out of the desert. I'm curious to know if we will be in {[[contact]]} together. You might consider taking a look at [[Find The Others]]. I'm wondering if you will be a [[Public Self-Modeler]]. 

For now, I'm just going to sit and watch. I think there is a non-zero chance you might see these words without me directly delivering them. Eventually, I may knock on your door, nomad.

Last night I created a bunch of tiddlers, one for each song I had found over the past couple of weeks. Then saw Jack Baty echo h0p3's concerns about TW scaling and thought it would be better to list found music by month, like this: 2019-01 found music. Could get out of control if it was one tiddler per song.

Fascinating. My [[Music: Library]], I believe, will eventually be something I atomize down to each song to give me full control through tagging. I hope to eventually create playlists and use my wiki as an interface to my music player through node (Bob, actually). I'm considering webtorrent links and a player in the wiki as well. However, [[Music Exploration]] will eventually get out of hand like my [[Link Log]], so I'm doing the same as you in that respect. 


Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
