title: Taking care of my things

People who empathize with themselves take care of their things. They care about their future selves. They want the experience to be as good as it can be not just in the present, but in the future as well. Even if the faith of the metaphysicians is ultimately wrong, even if we are infinitely (or even discretely) divisible into many selves/identities, even if our existence is thus reducible, it still benefits us to take it as an article of faith. This is the kind of prudential axiom-taking we have to be engaged in when [[Creating Faith]].

You spend time on this wiki, a lot. You really care about it. You care about your life. You care about the happiness of your children, and you care about your own happiness too.
