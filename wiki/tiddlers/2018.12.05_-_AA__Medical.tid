Woot woot so what does job training entail?
WED 12:38 PM
Videos so far. First aid on Saturday. Meeting with one of my bosses today as well.
WED 12:39 PM
(Yesterday was crazy and ...I wasn’t even answering myself hehe :woman-facepalming:)
WED 12:39 PM
Nice!
WED 12:39 PM
We used to do first aid and though it was boring, it was nice to be certified
WED 12:40 PM
Oh, don't worry about it. Lol. I think of everyone I talk with, you have the fastest response average. It's not even close. You are the most consistent interlocutor for chatting with me outside of my house.
WED 12:41 PM
As long as I'm paid on Saturday, I'm fine with it.
WED 12:42 PM
I hope I never have to perform CPR.
WED 12:42 PM
I would make a terrible doctor. Sounds like anxiety central to me.
WED 12:42 PM
I don't think I could turn off my gag reflex or feeling what they are feeling in some cases.
WED 12:43 PM
Yeah I think being a dr or a nurse would be awful...grossed out and empathetic
WED 1:00 PM
:face_with_open_mouth_vomiting::sob:
WED 1:01 PM
hehe =)
WED 1:01 PM
The only medical field I think I could do is Phary
WED 1:01 PM
Err Pharmacy
WED 1:01 PM
That makes sense with your chemistry background too.
WED 1:01 PM
Gloves and a window between me and their sickness —and most of the time I am counting or approving with the assistants handling the germy humane
WED 1:03 PM
Maybe I will go back to school someday and be a pill counter...
WED 1:07 PM
Would be good money. I am hesitant because I'm not sure how to do it morally. I think they directly benefit from a system designed to squeeze as much money from others as possible, even if it costs millions of lives (and radically alters the quality of life for hundreds of millions).
WED 1:09 PM
This is very true —and I am unlikely to give up teaching
WED 1:10 PM
Don’t think I could work in a lab making meds either... as least in the current system
WED 1:13 PM
Nobody showed for my training =/
WED 4:18 PM
it was a snow day, and nobody said not to come in from the training anyways
WED 4:19 PM
(I don't have the opportunity to just guess, hehe...probably fire me on the spot for no show)
WED 4:19 PM
anyways, interesting call chain and events
WED 4:19 PM
director was going to talk to me about being interim math teacher instead and picking up certification over the summer
WED 4:20 PM
(we could use the money, no doubt)
WED 4:20 PM
Teaching math would be sick.
WED 4:20 PM
Oooo teaching math is pretty fun!
WED 4:26 PM
