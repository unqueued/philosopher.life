title: 2012.12.13 - Autonomy: Final Exam

(5) Does being autonomous require having the ability to do otherwise? Discuss.


First, it isn’t exactly clear to me what it means to “have the ability to do otherwise.” There are several conceptions of this. I think the major difference we’ll find in the exploration of this ability stems from assumptions of compatibilism and incompatibilism.


Compatibilism will often take the “ability to do otherwise” as something like “being able to do what you wanted to do if you had wanted to do something different.” As determinists, they would concede that “what you want to do” is determined. But, if the world had been otherwise (I take many facts to be contingent truths) and a person had been determined to want something else, a person with this ability would still do what he wanted to do.


Incompatibilist interpretations of that ability are going for something much stronger than the compatibilist’s view. The ability to do otherwise isn’t some counterfactual statement concerning contingent truths. The ability to do otherwise requires having actual alternative possibilities. Exactly how this should play out isn’t clear (and I don’t have the time or space to quickly cover so much conceptual territory). This has some weird problems. What if you only had one choice available? (Mind you, I can’t actually think of an example of such a thing.) Frankfurt’s demon is another example that seems to bring up the incompatibilist’s view of the ability to do otherwise. In any case, exactly what counts as this ability will depend on one’s metaphysics.


What both the incompatibilist and the compatibilist interpretation of “the ability to do otherwise” have in common would be at least a leaning toward the agent-government model. This is particularly awkward for compatibilist theories, but I think that is what many compatibilists really mean (they don’t use agent-government language for no reason!). Models which have more to do with authenticity and the structure of will really don’t need to talk about this ability.


Second, the answer is: Yes. Libertarian free will which actually provides you alternative possibilities is the only sort of autonomy worth having, and we must have autonomy if we are morally responsible (and I flat out beg the question of our responsibility – so take my argument as being transcendental). Exactly how this works, I don’t know. This ability is worth having, though. Without this ability, we would simply be determined, as far as I can tell. From an incompatibilist’s intuitions, that would make us nonresponsible (something I simply can’t accept).


Compatibilist notions of this ability are incoherent. Nothing special comes out of it. As far as I can tell, we are no better than robots. Yes, if a robot had been programmed/determined to do otherwise, then it would have done otherwise. But this isn’t the kind of “otherwise” or provision of alternative possibilities necessary for the autonomy which makes us morally responsible. This compatibilist ability isn’t autonomy at all, and even if you wanted to call it autonomy, it isn’t a kind of autonomy worth having.



(2) Does being autonomous have intrinsic value? Discuss.


What does it mean to have intrinsic value? This is not clear at all. I take intrinsic value to be a property of an object such that it is valuable “in itself” or “on its own” or “for its own sake” or something like that. That is far too broad and vague, though. I assume that something with intrinsic value is an end itself, and not merely instrumentally valuable for achieving some other end. Whether or not autonomy is intrinsically valuable also depends a great deal on your metaphysics, metaethics, and normative ethical theory of choice (I’m pointing out that I appreciate how this is a loaded, impossible question – which I think is necessary for a short essay format).


Some interpretations of Kant might take autonomy to be intrinsically valuable (although it isn’t clear to me that Sensen’s interpretation does, but his view is somewhat unique regarding Kantian theory not being moral realist in the Shafer-Landau “properties” sense). It is often taken to be the grounds upon which a person is an end in themselves.


Consequentialist interpretations might also take autonomy to be intrinsically valuable (as far as I can tell, one could arbitrarily assign value to anything on such a theory). Mill, for example, thought autonomy was intrinsically valuable. We might even take eudaimonia (a consequentialist element of virtue theory, arguably) as requiring autonomy, not just instrumentally, but constitutively.


You argue that autonomy doesn’t have intrinsic prudential value. You might be right. There are other kinds of intrinsic value, though.


As I said in class before, this issue of ceding one’s autonomy to another (higher) authority is an old, unsolved set of problems. The Abrahamic religions, in particular, have dealt with this problem for thousands of years. Their argument is very interesting. Many from those traditions would argue both (1) autonomy has intrinsic value and (2) ceding autonomy to God is morally required. They would say that having autonomy is what makes us valuable and important – that it is a gift from God. They would also agree that higher prudential good (for you as an individual and globally) is achieved by ceding that autonomy to God.


From what I can tell, and given my libertarian assumptions, autonomy does seem to have intrinsic value. In what sense, I’m not sure. It does seem to be the thing which sets us apart from rocks, trees, and robots.


Perhaps the reason autonomy is important is that it allows the “I” in me to exist (set aside regress worries for now). Without autonomy, in some sense, there is no “I.” Perhaps I would have desires, beliefs, and a body, but “I” wouldn’t be there. I’m some Humean heap of desires and beliefs, and nothing more.

My final answer: I’m not absolutely sure, but probably.

    What are the major differences between Kantian conceptions of autonomy and modern conceptions? What role does autonomy play in Kant’s larger moral theory, and can that role be played by modern conceptions of autonomy? Discuss.



In terms of capacity, Kant vs. modern conceptions isn’t clear. Passive models, which generally employ authenticity or structure of the will, would have an odd sense of autonomy being a capacity. More active models seem to have a capacity which is similar to Kant’s conception. Modern incompatibilist theories might define this capacity as the ability to determine yourself or to do otherwise. Sensen does not interpret Kant as being a libertarian, others do. So, it depends on whose interpretation we are going with.


Kant’s autonomy is the capacity of the will, being a law unto itself. This capacity is a property we have. It is both a positive freedom and also a negative freedom. You determine yourself. You set down the law, and you can always break it.


Instead of being self-governing, autonomy is about being self-legislating on the Kantian view. Kantian self-legislation emphasizes law which is constitutive of reason. Autonomy, in this respect, shares more with passive models (in my opinion). People are just definitionally constituted by reason and autonomy (almost like a kind of coherentist model). Kantian autonomy emphasizes the bindingness of moral law.


You are also, in some sense, being an unmoved mover (although Sensen, again, does not take this in a libertarian sense – so, I have no idea what it means). Take telling a lie as an example. Naturally, we may be inclined to lie. Freedom and practical reason tell you to tell the truth. If you tell the truth, then you are the first cause of the action. Nature would have told you to tell the lie. You aren’t really free to choose between them. You are just free when you tell the truth. What counts as being “free” is really narrow on this view.


In terms of goal, modern conceptions would generally claim that autonomy is something worth protecting (from loss) and worth trying to gain back (if one has lost it, and assuming it is possible to gain back). In contrast, the goal of Kantian autonomy just is the command of the Categorical Imperative. You don’t choose the content of this goal. The content of moral law is defined by reason before you are even conscious of it. Analogously, the content of logic is given to you by your own reason. But you didn’t decide it. You are bound by the moral law because it is given to you by your own reason.


In terms of rights, some modern conceptions think of autonomy as a right of sovereignty. Otherwise, one might argue that we are afforded certain kinds of rights in virtue of being autonomous, such as being treated humanely, etc. According to Sensen’s interpretation, this isn’t Kant’s conception. I think a lot of Kant scholars would argue that Kant would see autonomy as a source of many human (actually, personhood) rights.


In terms of moral responsibility, both Kant and modern theories seem to be in agreement that moral obligation requires autonomy. At least on Sensen’s reading, Kant thinks that only his version of autonomy yields moral obligation, and that all other moral theories fail because their moral law would end up being contingent and non-universal. I swear I smell a whiff of compatibilism in the Sensen’s reading – being constituted by reason, etc. has a question-begging component to it that doesn’t sound like the freedom necessary to be morally responsible at all. That said, many Kantians read Kant as a libertarian (although that may be a mistake). The vast majority of modern conceptions of autonomy wouldn’t yield universal, necessary moral obligation in Kant’s view, so most conceptions really couldn’t play much of a role.
