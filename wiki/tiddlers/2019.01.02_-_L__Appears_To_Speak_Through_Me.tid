```
You have a good Xmas party?
DEC 26, 2018 4:34 PM

Happy New Year! =) -- What did you like about 2018, what are you hoping for 2019?
TUE 9:25 AM
Happy New Year! As for my favorite part, it would probably have to be my Saturday D&D game. It has gotten me through some rough times.
TUE 2:12 PM
Honestly this was the year of mental health for me. I learned a lot about myself this year.
TUE 2:13 PM
Yeah, that D&D game did a lot of work for you.
TUE 2:14 PM
So many important stories game out of it.
TUE 2:15 PM
came*
TUE 2:16 PM
I have never had so many ups and downs mentally till this year...
TUE 2:16 PM
Agreed. Been an insane year for you.
TUE 2:16 PM
My lowest lows. But I’m not sad about it, actually strangely glad I got to have the experience.
TUE 2:16 PM
I feel like I know how to handle myself better, and what it is I need to to function my best.
TUE 2:16 PM
What about you?
TUE 2:18 PM
Still thinking about it.
TUE 2:18 PM
It's been a productive and emotionally difficult year.  I am lucky to be alive.
TUE 2:19 PM
I'm less hopeful about many things, but I think lowering my predictive hope has been useful to me.
TUE 2:20 PM
I'm proud of my [[FTO]] project. It has been more fruitful than I could have imagined (it wasn't the reason I even made it).
TUE 2:21 PM
I feel my sense of purpose coming back, and I'm grateful for that.
TUE 2:22 PM
Every message I get from you affirming to me that you’re still here gives me hope :)
TUE 2:25 PM
=)
TUE 2:26 PM
I hope to be h0p3.
TUE 2:26 PM
And that’s awesome that your sense of purpose is coming back — that will help immensely.
TUE 2:26 PM
I think the most important thing I’ve learned this year is that the brain can and will lie to itself, even to its own detriment
TUE 2:52 PM
Being unable to trust yourself makes the pursuit of truth insidiously difficult.
TUE 2:53 PM
True, very true
TUE 2:57 PM
It’s a weird balance of knowing that a certain feeling is not always an indicator of something wrong outside of you but rather inside
TUE 2:57 PM
Where even knowledge is only probabilistic. It is possible to "know" (even justifiably know) a proposition which is false.
TUE 2:58 PM
I am not so convinced that knowledge isn't an indicator something wrong outside of you, but I think it is more indirect and complex than we might initially perceive.
TUE 2:59 PM
For example, we can causally trace why you have those internal states to external factors and explanations.
TUE 2:59 PM
It is important to me that we do not blame victims while still taking up personal responsibility. That is not an easy balance to strike, as you point out.
TUE 3:00 PM
Too true
TUE 3:01 PM
Adding in our profoundly fallible memories and our ability to confabulate fictions which fit our biases without conscious awareness of it makes it a monster of a problem. I cannot say I have a good answer, but I strongly agree to your worry you pose in the most important thing  you've learned this year.
TUE 3:03 PM
I never know how to adjust my goggles to perceive the world more clearly. I have to wear goggles to see well enough to adjust them or build new ones.
TUE 3:04 PM
I have seen a lot of changes in your reasoning about psychology and yourself this year too. I agree with your self-assessment. It's been a hell of a year for you.
TUE 3:05 PM
But I’m glad to have gone through the experience. I think the optimist in me will forever have rose-colored glasses in the end hehe
TUE 3:06 PM
Your frontal lobes are just finishing their development. Give it another decade. =)
TUE 3:07 PM
Fair enough xD
TUE 3:07 PM
Something else I’ve learned about myself: when I’m at my lowest or not functioning well in general, I turn introvert...
TUE 3:15 PM
But when I’m functioning normally, I turn extrovert.
TUE 3:15 PM
It’s strange.
TUE 3:15 PM
That might be right. I'm not 100% sure what introvert and extrovert mean (despite having studied it).
TUE 3:16 PM
I agree that when you are depressed that you will tend to isolate yourself and lose desire to interact with others.
TUE 3:16 PM
The way I understand it, the two differ in how they expend mental energy. Extroverts gain mental energy from being around others and flourish socially because of it, introverts gain mental energy from being alone (or with very close, trust people) and flourish individually because of it
TUE 3:17 PM
That is a common definition.
TUE 3:17 PM
It’s proven useful to me so far. I enjoy making comparisons between my healthy extroverted self and my introverted self. It helps me be more aware of my current state and what I can do to “fix” it.
TUE 3:18 PM
It might not just come in degrees but also kinds. For example, there are might one segments of the population that you become introverted toward in that definition.
TUE 3:18 PM
I also think it's clear that market forces and the American memeplex have radically selected for extroversion in a very unhealthy way.
TUE 3:19 PM
But, that awareness is awesome!
TUE 3:19 PM
Extroversion and narcissism .—.
TUE 3:19 PM
It seems to me that my wife is a classic introvert by most standards, but I can easily conceive of worlds in which she is an extrovert.
TUE 3:20 PM
It depends on the people that surround her.
TUE 3:20 PM
Or, that is at least one important part of the story
TUE 3:21 PM
Perhaps introversion/extroversion is a kind of average among all possible worlds or something. I do not know.
TUE 3:24 PM
Possibly
TUE 3:40 PM
Oh, something else weird I discovered over the holidays... I find the mess my parents’ live in absolutely unbearable now and I have no idea how to address that.
TUE 3:41 PM
I think my capacity to ignore it has finally broken.
TUE 3:41 PM
You can go clean.
TUE 3:45 PM
Build them up.
TUE 3:45 PM
Still might not solve it.
TUE 3:46 PM
My extroversion point is simply that our ability not to be drained by others is completely contextual. [[k0sh3k]] agrees to my claim: it's going to be hard to find people who (a) are even capable of understanding her, and (b) would choose to do so in a [[T42T]] manner.
TUE 3:47 PM
I am reminded of the predictive coding theory of mind which is roughly about having evolved brains that seek computational (energy) efficiency between our fast and slow minds. It's easy to be any person to be an extrovert around angels that empathize with them.
TUE 3:50 PM
It's easy for any*
TUE 3:50 PM
My grammar is pretty awful today.
TUE 3:50 PM
I tend to start writing a sentence, shift my train of thought, and fail to re-write it, lol.
TUE 3:51 PM
Extroversion is a sign of relational adaptivity to the people that surround you (lots of ways to dynamically adapt, though that isn't always possible in every context...at which point, adaptivity looks like introversion).
TUE 3:53 PM
You can always invite them to your place or elsewhere (having parties at the church seems like a good idea).
TUE 3:54 PM
Hmm, fair point!
TUE 5:23 PM
As far as the extro/introvert
TUE 5:23 PM
I guess I should explain the cleanliness situation a bit better: when we go down to e-town for visits, we usually stay several days. Mom seems to prefer we stay with them, which makes sense since they have space. Usually they clean the house up for when we come because [[K]] is fairly allergic to cat dander (as you know), but they’ve not been doing so nearly as much lately. They usually clean my sister’s room up well so he at least has a place to retreat to, but... this most recent stay was really rough on him and me, both mentally and physically.
TUE 5:27 PM
That makes sense.
TUE 5:29 PM
And honestly... a lot of the way they live is just gross to me. All their furniture is covered in stains and other questionable marks, likely from pets, and the counters and floors look like they haven’t been cleaned in months...
TUE 5:29 PM
Saying this all I realize mom may read it if she’s browsing your Wiki later. I wonder what she’ll think...
TUE 5:29 PM
I'm especially sensitive myself. Asthma and allergies cannot help.
TUE 5:29 PM
That is true. Lol. Well, I think it is good to be honest.
TUE 5:30 PM
(surprise!)
TUE 5:30 PM
Aye, you’re right.
TUE 5:30 PM
I remember Grandma cleaning our fridge. It was a humbling experience.
TUE 5:31 PM
I just don’t know how to do it graciously. My parents have lived like this my whole life... they only recently got better-ish.
TUE 5:31 PM
Mary has cleaned for them many a time.
TUE 5:31 PM
It’s one reason she doesn’t stay over there anymore when she visits.
TUE 5:31 PM
I remember my great Grandmother Bubbles was addicted to smoking (it's not as though she liked smoking: she was literally addicted). It took her most of her life to quit. Eventually, when I started getting sick enough, she was able to let it go.
TUE 5:32 PM
Is that your way of saying “maybe you talking to them about it will help them change?”
TUE 5:32 PM
I do not know. I do not have any answer here.
TUE 5:33 PM
Hmm. I’ll have to mull it over.
TUE 5:33 PM
It brings a lot of things to my mind. I am reminded of trying to help [[SLT]] with her computer illiteracy.
TUE 5:34 PM
Oh?
TUE 5:34 PM
Don’t think I’ve heard this story.
TUE 5:34 PM
I actually don't mind regularly helping in that respect as long as it is not socially expected of me.
TUE 5:34 PM
Ah, well, it's a series of stories since I was a teenager, lol.
TUE 5:34 PM
Makes sense hehe
TUE 5:35 PM
Depression sucks. Learned helplessness is ridiculously hard to handle.
TUE 5:35 PM
Very true...
TUE 5:35 PM
I wonder, too, if they have all learned to just ignore it...
TUE 5:35 PM
I know I did very much so when I was younger.
TUE 5:36 PM
It is likely a source of profound anxiety.
TUE 5:36 PM
Aye. I am certain it is, for my mother at least.
TUE 5:36 PM
I'm not sure how much it is up to them, though I do believe in the radical freedom necessary to modify our habits (however slowly).
TUE 5:37 PM
They have, very slowly, gotten better. It has taken so very long, to the point that my sister has learned all these habits.
TUE 5:38 PM
But she’s a different story altogether.
TUE 5:39 PM
To my eyes, there are clusters of problems, and it's hard to solve any one of them without making systematic progress in all of them (I aim to be slow to point fingers here too...getting out the pit is hell; it takes more courage and energy than anything else I've ever done.).
TUE 5:40 PM
Mmm, very good point.
TUE 5:42 PM
I have lots to think about, it seems.
TUE 5:42 PM
Goals for this new year.
TUE 5:43 PM
There may be low-hanging fruit tactics and even approaches to triage. You are in a good position to objectively reason about it.
TUE 5:44 PM
It will be worth your time to continue talking about it. If and when they may need your help remodeling/cleaning, you should be the first there to help and the last to leave.
TUE 5:45 PM
I hope so. I tend to get too emotional about these subjects because they did effect me personally for so long...
TUE 5:45 PM
Yes.
TUE 5:45 PM
I see that. I realize it has profoundly shaped several aspects of you.
TUE 5:45 PM
I like that though. I would love to see them improve. It would mean that much more to me because of the effects, I think.
