* Yay! I have work tomorrow. Probably going to be boring, and I will be sick to my stomach thinking about the education these youths are receiving.
** It is a fascinating experience to be the lowest man on the totem pole according to the credentials they accept. Nobody actually gives a shit what I think, lol. Am I a source of free labor that makes them look good? Sure. Whatever.
* Your offspring aren't on task effectively enough, though your son is trying. Do not fail them.
* Dental appointments
* Cancel that account, and get the backdated refund.
* Make sure DP are doubled.
* Jobs up at Milligan. Fuck it. Let's do it. 
** Cmon universe, you dickbitch, what's the worst that can happen?
