My brother and I talked for ~45 minutes. 

His shoulder doesn't seem to be getting worse.

He was telling me about the 18yo kid at work who drives me a bit batty. He does right by the kid though. He works with a guy who drives drunk often enough, cheats a lot on his taxes, but has a special construction-meming skill for delivering perfectly specified one-liners in detailed contexts.

My brother talked about a security guard who draws, and he recommended I look for something like that in our area.

I thanked him for offering the kiddos mopeds. We talked about the wipeouts we experienced on ours and The Scab. 

I talked about working on the letters a bit. I think it would be good practice for him to write down two different interpretations: one charitable and the other not.

My brother is taking a vacation! They are doing a bed'n'breakfast in Savannah. He wants to buy a laptop (though he has one?) for 4 days, jokingly though. He's going to be bored, but maybe he'll have some books to read. I assume it will be an excellent time for talking with Rebecca too.

He's thinking about trying different meds because the weight gain and libido difference has not been great. That seems like a good plan to me.
