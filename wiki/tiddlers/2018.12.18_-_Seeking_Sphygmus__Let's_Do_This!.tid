title: 2018.12.18 - Seeking Sphygmus: Let's Do This!

I love my Update Scanner extension (even if I don't trust it). I saw the update immediately. She's pushing herself into the light where I can see. I need to explore. We have a lot in common, but there are also lots of differences. It's like a Christmas present to see her in her work. I think I need to systematically crawl, though I am not sure how to do so. This is a key question, and perhaps I need to ask her what path she wants me to take. There may be many routes I must take. I do not know. This is a novel experience for me.
