!! Audit:

* This log continues to be a valuable pulsetaking tool. It's not the primary aspect of our work in our wikis. It is, however, a fun capstone/tradition to the family time evening. I love that we do it.
* Our family still isn't sleeping terribly well, but it's not out of control. We've been working on it.
* I've been thinking about my brother JRE a lot this month.
* Apparently, I will never be able to pick out watermelons. I had my wife there picking them out, and I couldn't tell the difference between good and bad, even with practice.
* I think it's awesome that we say something good about ourselves outloud. It's important that we can sum up what we found important about our week, what we were proud of, etc. with each other.
** I think it also adds more flavor
* My grammar is especially bad in here.
* My daughter's writing is cleaner than my own in this. I can see her handiwork though. I'm glad she helps us do this. I like to cook while she handles this.
* My wife has been experimenting and using your wiki differently. I'm glad to see it. I hope I can be of more use to her in this regard, but I don't know.
