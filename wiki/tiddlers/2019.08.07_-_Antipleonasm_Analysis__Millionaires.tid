!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

It is an insidious ~~fairy~~ demonic tale we've been told, and who doesn't want to believe it? I made this mistake as a teenager. I was a socialist (and have always sought it) who also thought he would be well-off until ~21 and started sliding deeper into recognizing the nightmare for what it is. Many people are surprised I have not used my brains to become wealthy. I am glad I have not wasted my life in that respect, but I'll say living as the precariat sucks in some crucial respects. 

Note that it only takes a percentage of reactionaries to hold us at bay. The middleclass is taught to hate the poor and identify with (empathizing especially with) the elite. Our tax system, our media, business etiquette, and even our schools reinforce it. A failure to empathize with the poor is a crime against [[Humanity]].
