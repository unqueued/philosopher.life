We didn't have time to do welding today. We studied for a test. This was a very tricky section of the book for me. I read and studied it many times. There was too much information to figure out what would be tested on. I had to guess what would be worth remembering. Unfortunately, I had to guess on 40% of the exam. That is absurd. I made a 76%. It's passing, barely. I decided to just keep it instead of retaking. My teacher was fine with it since he felt several of the questions were "trick questions" that actually had multiple acceptable answers. Again, it's pass/fail. That's all the certification is about. 

After the exam, we moved onto our socket welds project. We made several mistakes that required some quick grind-cuts on the tacks. Repositioning is getting easier. I'm glad I have a few more weeks of practice at this. I've been told I may be moved to work with Ferguson on Monday since he definitely needs a partner. Socket welds are really a two-person job. My teacher regularly tells us not to try it with one-person (although, I've seen Chris do an acceptable-ish job on his own).
