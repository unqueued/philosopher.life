Good morning, [[L]]. What are your plans for today?
MON 7:56 AM
Morning! Just work and shopping truthfully. Monday’s are my long days more often than not.
MON 7:57 AM
Oof. I'm sorry.
MON 7:58 AM
I often buy one easy meal/treat while shopping for that day to try to curb it. I despise shopping.
MON 7:59 AM
Well, when I don't have time/money/energy, lol.
MON 7:59 AM
It is what it is. Monday’s tend to be late because our managers can never seem to decide what they want to say to our network until like 5:00.
MON 7:59 AM
I should NEVER shop on an empty stomach xD
MON 8:00 AM
Then you buy all the things.
MON 8:01 AM
Also, have you been able to pack on more weight. I know you've been stressed enough that you've had to force feed yourself.
MON 8:01 AM
I have! Not a ton, but enough for me to not be at a dangerous weight anymore.
MON 8:02 AM
Yay.
MON 8:02 AM
I too have successfully added weight to my body. Gorgeous.
MON 8:02 AM
It’s weird having this problem. I know a lot of people would probably LIKE to have this problem, so I try not to complain about it too much lol
MON 8:02 AM
Lol, I hear ya.
MON 8:02 AM
I’m taking donations if you’d like to contribute
MON 8:03 AM
Now I'm thinking about where I would lipo and transfer fat around my body. I think I would deflate my moobs and grow the surfaces that touch my chair, molded to it.
MON 8:04 AM
Comfy
MON 8:04 AM
Hahaha
MON 8:05 AM
Part of me wonders how these “you suck at gaining weight” genes made it this far. Wouldn’t they be TERRIBLE for survival?
MON 8:41 AM
My assumption is that diversity in genetic code enables adaptivity in changing contexts, including a wide variety of rare events which evolution has coped with.
MON 9:19 AM
They are terrible for survival in some circumstances, of course.
MON 9:19 AM
I think this part of your genes are highly adaptive to the modern world though.
MON 9:20 AM
You are treated differently because of how you look; in fact, it plays a much larger role in many social dynamics than most people want to admit.
MON 9:21 AM
I think you've obviously developed some good habits for eating too.
MON 9:23 AM
So, I don't know how much of it is boils down to your genes either.
MON 9:23 AM
Hmm, fair point
MON 9:46 AM
Question: do you like listening to podcasts?
MON 9:46 AM
Or could tolerate a short ~10 minute one?
MON 9:46 AM
I so want to. All the cool kids do it. I wager people with 125 IQ's listen to podcasts, so I need to.
MON 9:47 AM
I've never found one that works for me.
MON 9:47 AM
I will gladly try another!
MON 9:47 AM
lol... it’s more to fill the empty space in the office with talking
MON 9:47 AM
I’m not sure if you’d particularly find the whole series interesting, but 99% Invisible has a couple of episodes I think you’d be interested in
MON 9:47 AM
Gracias
MON 9:48 AM
Like the episode I listened to today — #63 The Political Stage
MON 9:48 AM
Juicy
MON 9:48 AM
I will listen to that one.
MON 9:48 AM
Perhaps not as deep as you’re wanting it to go, but it was still pretty interesting
MON 9:50 AM
I appreciate your sending me the podcast. That is a good episode. What do you think of it?
MON 10:21 AM
I was more shocked than I should have been I think. As someone who has orchestrated events/meetings I should know better than to think political “debates” and speeches are anything but overly staged.
MON 10:24 AM
Honestly it makes me feel even more like our political system is an utter sham.
MON 10:24 AM
I would like to recommend a book (I've possibly recommended it before): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent
MON 10:26 AM
I'm a huge fan of his work. It's not complicated, it's well-researched, and cleanly articulated. That one is a classic.
MON 10:27 AM
It is not easy to understand capitalism, and that presents an important section of it.
MON 10:28 AM
It is on my “to read” list!
MON 10:28 AM
I can send you an audiobook, but it has some visuals that are worth looking at, IIRC.
MON 10:28 AM
Oooohhhh
MON 10:29 AM
Visuals are always helpful, I’ll go the paper route
MON 10:29 AM

MON 10:30 AM
Updated copy of the book.
MON 10:31 AM
I will open this when I actual have better cell signal (it will take forever atm)
MON 10:33 AM
More things because I wonder if you’ll find them interesting
MON 12:00 PM
Vox released a video about the reason behind two of Boeing’s commercial airplanes crashing recently. Only about 6 minutes if you are interested: https://youtu.be/H2tuKiiznsY
MON 12:07 PM
Thank you. I will add it to my Link Log (https://philosopher.life/#Link%20Log). I don't usually have a lot of video to add to it.
