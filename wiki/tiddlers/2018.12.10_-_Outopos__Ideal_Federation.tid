title: 2018.12.10 - Outopos: Ideal Federation

The DHT's federation is necessary given NATing and perhaps a host of other network problems. The DHT is second-ordered, the emergent external proxy network: we rely upon it implicitly. What does ideal federation look like? We rely upon the intermediation of representation, but who will be our representatives (ultimately enabling The Representative) and how? Choose wisely.

Nodes on The Federation have to transparently test each other (and they can). Resource trading is necessary. This, unfortunately, is an attempt at sharded blockchains (yes, fuck me, I hate that I use that word). [[The Golden Rule]] can be used to decentralize tracking. We don't have to have a perfect ledger; we just need one sufficiently good at punishing those who don't cooperate enough to enable those who are cooperating to actually benefit from each other. It's F2F modeled. The Sybil attack is the dialectic of networking gone awry, the majority tyrant master of the "truth" adjusted for evilpurposes is something which can only be partially mitigated through P2P sanitization of Plato's Guardian class. [[T42T]] cooperative transparency is the only method to build The Federation.

The P2P nodes are sometimes too vulnerable and/or lack the resources to participate in this respect. That is fine. In fact, we aim to serve those individuals. First, we owe a great deal to the oppressed, the helpless, and the needy. Secondly, the 3% of Altruists are the proverbial angels among us, and they must be the winning algorithm in [[The Great Human Conversation]] (even through realpolitik work). I do not claim to be nearly that moral, but I know it's my duty to help them. This is an exercise of [[The Golden Rule]]; it is a commitment to [[The Original Position]] in political practice.

The emergent will of [[The Original Position]] is the Philosopher King of Plato's City; the heuristical justice which just is the most morally effective probabilistic inference algorithm available to we [[fff]] creatures. It is the morally justified political hyperobject; Humanity must wisely rule humans. How are you going to implement [[The Golden Rule]] at scale, decentralized, and with social contractarian validity to lay claim to the Rule of Law. Our sovereign must represent us immaculately. Yes, I know the anarchists and internalists hate the thought, and I see history littered with failure here. It is all too easy to be wrong. In any case, that creature is already being built whether we want to openly recognize it or not. I think we are currently building Golem. How about you, precious? Indeed, it is a metamodern leap of faith.

Building the unNATed network with nodes that do not trust each other more than is generated by [[T42T]] is the starting place. Yes, I think it should be ridiculously high performance to begin with. They will store the record of the DHT entrance IPs. Preventing the single point of failure has to be the beginning. I do not give a shit about human readability here; that is a contraption that can be built later.

What is The Federation really doing? It's building a free cloud (storage, CPU, RAM, GPGPU, bandwidth, etc.) for the other federated nodes in order to serve the P2P network (which is the end goal). P2P will never have voice since those who control the physical infrastructure of the internet may never give us unNATed, unthrottled connectability again. P2P can trade with The Federation; it will have to. Does this create a market among nodes? I do not know how that should be built, and I am worried about exploitation even if were magically bugfree and maximally performant. There is too much I do not understand in this realm. I don't know how we are going to build worldclass software for free. Ultimately, this may be a problem best solved through WASM for safety, portability, agnosticism (it does feel like LLVM to me).

I am not convinced the brightest minds of our generated spend their lives trying to build the tools meant to decentralize power as their vocation, though many spend their freetime volunteering. This really does look like a pipedream. What more can I do besides dream until I can see it? Some thing simply cannot be built from bootstrapping duck tape. Something which can compete with with centralized power will need to be able to snowball its advantage from the get go (makes me want to use GPL, but I am opposed to IP: even good faith IP).

The Federation has to be given first class priority. It is the first stage of development. The P2P has to come after.
