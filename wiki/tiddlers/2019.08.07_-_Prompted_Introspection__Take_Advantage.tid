title: 2019.08.07 - Prompted Introspection: Take Advantage

!! What is your opinion about people who take advantage of others?

It depends on the context. Are you taking advantage of Hitler to save the lives of innocent people? Go for it; in fact, you may be obligated. Now, you might say that isn't taking advantage by definition. I probably need your clarification here. 

I think most people take advantage of others unjustifiably. There are [[gems]] out there. I live for them.
