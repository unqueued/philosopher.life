I have no idea if those numbers are accurate. Comfort is crucial for spending our emotional and cognitive energy on academics (and other activities). Tests scores are better when you have food in your belly, feel safe, work in favorable conditions, and meet the requirements of Maslow's hierarchy. There are plenty of reasons children in the American South have traditionally not learned much over the summers, and heat is likely a factor.

Indirectly, there may be stricter evolutionary fitness tests built into living in cold climates. Preparations for a winter you couldn't survive without discipline and social cohesion while inside likely shaped many societies over time. Time conventions and ambitions in regions I've lived which had tropical climates were often quite relaxed, and that went for academics as well. It is possible heat had many kinds of influence on one's motivation and ability to study. 

It is true that IQ rates are falling in many regions. Of the reasons for it, global warming is almost guaranteed to be direct and indirect cause. Of course, I wouldn't be me without saying it: capitalism is a systematic war on the poor and the mobility of those who were unlucky in their birth lotteries.
