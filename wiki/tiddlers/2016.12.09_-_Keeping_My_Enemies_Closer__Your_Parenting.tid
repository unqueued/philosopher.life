title: 2016.12.09 - Keeping My Enemies Closer: Your Parenting

I think you did not understand the minds of your children in important ways. I think it also really hard to understand the minds of your children, since they were not neurotypical. I think you technically had the ability to learn and repond to these problems, and you didn't. I also think you had so many other pressures in your life as you were raising us that you couldn't empathize with us. If generally believed you did have the time, energy, resources, and life-direction to do it.
