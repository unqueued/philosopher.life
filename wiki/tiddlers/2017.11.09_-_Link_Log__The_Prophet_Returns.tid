*** Normally, this would just be Confirm My Bias, Neat, or maybe Tool. It sits here in my coveted spot because I said this yesterday: "Physical access, even for a second, is pwnage on any major OS." Intel's ME just took another hit; physical access is now a Backdoor of Backdoors for mortals as well (although, this is not a primary attack vector). Blackbox backdoors don't stay that way. As always, backdoors are retarded. Ugh. AMD is next, mark my words. Just because they are smaller doesn't mean they don't have their own version of this backdoor forced by the US government. Again, you all are stupid as fuck for not being disturbed and angry about this.

*** When you stand up against Capitalism, your mockery will mean something. You have no integrity. This is a virtue signal mixed with some terrible reasoning.

*** Amazon is going to own us.
** https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2017-elections-suggest-incumbency-wont-save-republicans-in-2018/
*** Of course. And, this is just the latest round of the false compromise towards the Right yet again, where the DNC continues to just be a corporate shell playing in tandem with the RNC to fuck us over.

*** If they would do this to defeat human garbage like Clinton, imagine the wars they would fight against actual Leftism.

*** How about putting banks on the hook for lending to the wrong person? Also, if you get hacked, you should get fucking wrecked. Force us to engage in secure computing. They've offloaded all the risk and work onto us. That's some bullshit.
*** Also, public key crypto.
