title: Nexus

We are bootstrapping ourselves at the nexus.

[[KIN]]: Since we're being empathic here, I think the rabbleroused-crowd would next claim: "Look at him. He wants to use big words. He thinks he's fancy. He thinks he's better than we are. He's arrogant. We hate him." Is that rational?

[[RPIN]]: Two can play at that "Identify the Hyprocrite" game: [[Our Dear Programmer]] uses socially taboo substances, thus he must, by definition, be wrong and off his rocker."

[[KIN]]: Zing! We are bottlenecked, our vision fogged, but all is not lost.

/s. No. We must release ourselves from the psychopathy of being facetious towards existentialism. Inexorably, we all must answer these questions or take up assumptions for ourselves. It is Dasein's [[plight|Human Plight]] at Kant's Crossroads. It is the infinitesimal center of who we are.

I am not sure what I am. I am certain of some things. I have axioms (you can bet your ass that "I have axioms" is axiomatic).<<ref "1">>

I am the thing which paradoxically is itself and disassociates from itself. I create new dimensions of myself, but the world around me also creates me. I am in a struggle to control myself in order to free myself.

I must be honest with myself. I must empathize with myself. I must know myself. 

My dad says he can't be a salesman of something he doesn't believe in. I think that is a mark of integrity and rationality. What am I selling to myself? What do I really believe? What is actually worth selling to myself?

I hope the wisest things I say are those things that I say to myself. After that, I hope the wisest things I say are to my family. After that, to the other kinds of social objects and constructions (ends in themselves) which we take to be valuable ends in themselves.

I'm not a god, but I am a self-programmer. I'm autonomous. I am free within limits. I'm me. I am my vocation. I must structure and restructure the things I value. I must transform myself. I must become the person I want to be.
