title: 2017.07.20 - Pipefitting Log

I showed up early again. I did my perimeter sweep, and I decided to add a box to the end of the "in" underground pipe, even though Terry didn't have one on his. I'm sticking to both the letter and spirit of the law he gave me, even if he didn't follow it himself. He might think it is dumb, but he might think I'm doing my best to follow his instructions (which I believe is more important at this point, because he already thinks I'm dumb in some sense or another, lol). I sat in the car writing and reading. People showed up earlier today, around 7:30.

I measured out the last leg of pipe running from the control valve to the "Victaulic"  inlet to the chiller. I asked Terry if I could use the Victaulic nippled pipe already on the stand outside. He said yes. I cut it while Jaye and I talked a great deal about the concept and history of racism, as well as Islam. He has a sharp mind for so little education. Yet, ultimately, he doesn't pursue the truth virtuously enough given his context, imho. Also, found out he just got out in April. 

We have two sockolets to put in the pipe. I got to use Terry's centerfinder. It was fucking amazing! I had to ask for sizes again because I forgot. Hopefully, I'm not annoying Terry by peppering him with questions. I just want to make sure it turns out the way he wants it. The drawing is not detailed enough, so I have to ask for help. I need that information.

I cut the holes with the oxy torch. Jaye and I argued about how it should be started. He doesn't seem to understand the words coming out of my mouth sometimes, and then he has to act like he was making a good point after I clarify myself. He can't just say "okay, yeah, I get what you're saying." Lol. In any case, the holes were fine. 

It's weird when Jaye gives me the "field experience over school" talk. He only applies it to things he learned in the field rather than school (primarily fitting rather than welding). When it comes to welding, he relies upon his school knowledge quite a bit, and that's where he argues from. We both agree that school prepares one to be ready to learn in the field, to acquire experience, etc. What counts as X, as a good X, distinctions, processes, formalizations, and explanations of things ultimately are very school-oriented though. It takes forever, clearly, to learn a lot of things I learned in school out in the field. Terry's boys still don't know how to do the math. Note, Jaye went to the prestigious Tulsa welding school (very expensive, and sadly, not as good as Dale's). He values his education a lot, and he should. 

Also, he makes $31/hour + 125 per diem at his other job, which is admittedly seasonal. I saw his paychecks. They were fucking huge, 3x what we make here. Okay. Maybe I need to accelerate my welding learning? The boilermaker's union looks so much more appealing (and Jaye works with boilermakers too).

I cut a pipe for the support. It turns out that Terry only wants a 1" pipe. I'm not making anything fancy like I would in shop class. I cut some plate for the bottom. I'm very worried about getting this part right. It could screw it all up if it is even partially off.

Speaking of something being off, Terry and his 2.5 helpers are racing us on Chiller #2 against me and Jaye on Chiller #1 (unofficially, no one is talking about it, but it seems to be there). They fucked up bad though. I was talking to Terry about the same problem on ours a couple days ago. The initial 90 coming off the underground pipe is very hard to get level, plumb, and oriented correctly against the chiller's pipes. I'm not even sure if ours will work, and I did my best with it (which was hard, because Jaye actually requires a bevel, like you're supposed to do, unlike Terry and Jacob). Terry's "in" pipe though is now not plumb against the flange. He's tried to jimmy it with flanges, but that didn't work. Now he has to either bend his connecting flange (gross) or cut the fucking pipe, grind it, realign it, and do another very low 2G weld in the mud again. I think he is extremely pissed right now. He may just let it go through. Just force it. 

I found my alignment pin. Leroy had put it gently behind the cage. I'm glad to have found it. We needed it. Apparently, we mounted the wrong control valve. It said "leaving" on a tiny tag I didn't see, meant for the outlet from the chiller. Terry said it shouldn't matter, but the bureaucrats won't stand for it. I unmounted it, and Jaye forklifted the new one over. We mounted it together. Less bitching about the star-pattern this time. He let me do it. 

Jaye said to me that he thinks Terry is trying to race us on the other chiller. I did not say a word to Jaye about it, but he came to the same conclusion as I did. Mind you, beyond his experience, Terry has more workers, better tools, and he has the benefit of seeing me do it first (he's spent a lot of time figuring out what we need to do). Perhaps it is a prelude to firing us. Eh, I'll take every drop of experience I can get.

After lunch, we finished constructing the pipe and stand. We got it all set. We lugged it over there since the forklift was out of commission. It didn't fit in two ways. Fuck! The first was that the stand/support, as I was very worried about, was too tall by about half a centimeter. I worked on it quite a bit, but it still didn't work. Furthermore, we had to fucking wrestle the pipe to fit it in. I could cold-chisel pry for one gasket, but we needed to do two. I didn't know (it would have been nice to have to know about more than the outer coupling). I told Terry this was my first time working with Victaulic (never heard of it before). He gave me zero information about it, no pointers, nothing. 

Also, I hurt my finger, pinching it bad, when we muscled the pipe into place. I think it is broken or fractured. After my adrenaline came down, it hurt like a bitch. The swelling isn't too bad, but it is tender. Although, it isn't tender everywhere. I told Terry since he is my foreman. He immediately called HR, Pam. I talked to Pam. I told her about it, and she offered to pay for me to go to emergency care services. She said they try to handle things in-house before workers comp. I told her I wanted to work, and that the emergency service people would just split it up and give me acetaminophen. I made a joke with her about the irony of hurting my finger at a "medic" facility when she asked what site I was on. She laughed, but she also thought it was odd that I was just telling her about it. She noted it on my record. Recall, of course, that HR is exclusively about protecting the company, not the workers. 

In any case, we had Terry come to look at the pipe. He said we shouldn't have made a support like we did, since it was too "dogmatic," by which he meant that it was very fussy and difficult to get perfectly right. Well, no shit Sherlock! I was worried the entire time about it. I knew that was a significant point of failure. It's why I went to talk to you about it multiple times, asshole. He then said what he wanted me to do in the first place (but waited until after I completed the project to tell me).

He wants an 8-piece of angle (one side pointing down) going perpendicular to the 6" pipe, leaving space for a 2-by-4 since the insulators need the space anyway. Similar pipe and a flat sheet of steel on the bottom. I had no idea it would be insulated outside either. Oh, and it needed holes in the bottom for those expanding concrete fasteners (I forget their name, but I've used them before). Why didn't he tell me when I asked the first two times? He saw me building this the whole time. I talked to him about it. He's the fucking foreman. If he wanted it a certain way, then why not tell me? Why not correct me before I waste our time? I gave him ample opportunity. I'm obviously interested in his knowledge, guidance, and correction. Jaye saw it too. 

This isn't sabotage, but it certainly shows that Terry wants me to fail in many respects. He's not going to move much of a muscle to help or guide me, even when I ask for it. Look, I know I don't know how to do it his way or even well. Why not help me? Don't you want your team to succeed?

Oh, I'm learning alright, but I'm thinking he needs to "teach me a lesson," put me in my place, purposely allow me to flail without cause. This isn't teaching. I can learn the lesson without it, obviously. I'm going to make mistakes even with guidance. I can only deduce, alongside the race, that he wants to slow us down. It benefits him for us to go slower. Perhaps it is "evidence" that we shouldn't be on the job. I don't know.

He's a frenemy. I will do my best with it. I have much to learn, and I will learn it the hard way if I must. 

Also, I talked to Terry about his centerfinder. I adore the tool, and I thought I might connect with him on that topic. I told him that I admired it and about how we had to use a square and level in the class to try and mimic it (not nearly as effective or easy). He just blew me off with a "is that so?" He then ignores me and turns to Leroy and explains the tool was his father's, and it was the last tool his father gave to him (even though his father was retired). Terry literally didn't want to talk to me about this tool I complimented him on which had serious sentimental value to him. He doesn't like me. Lol. I realize, not everyone is going to like me, but it is very difficult for me to improve and do well when I'm fighting an uphill battle against my boss every step of the way.

Anyways, they left. I showed Jaye the cold-chisel pry method that Tim taught me. Even with lube, we still couldn't find a way to slip the awkward Victaulic gasket on this way (oh yeah, would have been nice to hear or even see one of these before trying to fit it). We took it down. Jaye joked like he hurt his foot (mimicking my finger). I laughed. My finger hurt though. 

We dragged it back. Jaye cut the stand, and I cut the Victaulic nipple at the weld on both sides, since that seems like it would give us enough space. I'm worried it won't though. Maybe I should cut it even more. I'll check again. The width of the weld minus the gap. That'll be the difference. We could probably afford an even larger gap. A tiny cut wouldn't hurt, and it would give me additional breathing space. Better safe than sorry. It's only tacked right now

Jaye said not to bevel it. He was going to do it without a bevel this time to show them how it is done, just this time. He, of course, wants to win this race. We won't, but I won't give Terry the satisfaction of whooping our asses either. I'm going to take it to him (game, not my mouth). I'm still bringing my A game. 

Jaye said that our foreman was jealous (he meant envious) of what I was doing after just 6 months. He said that Terry is pissed off that some smart hotshot kid (my attitude has been nothing but respect and humility towards Terry and his sons) is doing this well. It does fit Terry's historical view too. Jaye might be right. Of course, it might just be that I'd like to think that (so far, I'm the only person I've met in the field who is doing what I'm doing in this space of time though).
