!! Audit:

* I used my wiki thoroughly to answer these questions. My opinion is that in coming to recognize the meaning and purpose of [[Find The Others]], I am transforming the practice of [[Prompted Introspection]] as well. I have a style of responding to interlocutors by linking throughout and talking about the wiki which gives me very high level responses quickly. It feels like I'm "writing Python" or something. I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate that fact.
** Now, let me admit this is not perfect, perhaps not even decent. I'm still learning the art. That's okay. I have time. This is super important, and I believe my ability to engage in this process will only continue to snowball as this wiki does. 
** This feels very much like my shift away from {[[Projects]]}, a marker than led to the Version 2.0 of this wiki. The epistemic internalism here is only going to become a stronger force, and I love that.
** KEEP TALKING! GO GO GO!
* I hear [[hope]] in [[h0p3]]; that is high praise, sir.
* Some of the answers are just beautifully personal. Sometimes I feel like this is the only log that really gives away the flavor of who I am in the standard sense.
* This is always a very emotional log to read. It's crazy fucking personal.
* I didn't address my interlocutors very often this month.
* My wiki shutdown shield, lol.
* I'm scrolling in reverse because it works nicely with my hover. Admittedly, this is not in chronological order, but that's okay. Read your writing backwards; sometimes that really does help you edit.
* I'm glad to see myself recognizing that I am a stay-at-home dad. I need to own it to rock it.
* Having answered before and thinking about my previous answer outloud was super neat, btw. 
* Lots of discussion of my autism on here. I appreciate having the opportunity to think about my lens as clearly as I can outloud. I need to state it carefully for myself.
