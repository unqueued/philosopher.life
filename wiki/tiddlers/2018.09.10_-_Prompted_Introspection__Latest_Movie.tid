title: 2018.09.10 - Prompted Introspection: Latest Movie

!! What happens in the latest movie you saw?

I hate to say it, but I've basically stopped watching movies for the most part. Maybe that will change when I'm all growed up? This reminds me of that weird fact I keep encountering: the adults all around me have stopped listening to music. That blows my mind. They do watch movies though. This is weird. I've mentioned all of this before, and I'm not any closer to answering the issue.

I have a very hard time finding movies worth my time. I basically don't watch a film unless someone I trust tells me I should watch it. I don't have time to waste my attention span on a mere drug that I'm not going to adore. I have more important experience machines to experience. I do watch lots of video, of course. I don't want to sound like that asshole, but movies have been algorithmically designed to maximize profit. They don't tell weird people on the ends of bellcurves stories that matter as much, at least not mainstream. 

I lack the time, knowledge, and intelligence to approach real Film Art, imho. 

Alright, so to the question, I've had to try a couple searches, and the answer I've found is: [[The Matrix]]. I forgot about the script commentary. I was going to delete that. I fear it's taking a lot of space up for no reason. Eh, maybe just the tail end instead? If I wrote it, I want to keep it.
