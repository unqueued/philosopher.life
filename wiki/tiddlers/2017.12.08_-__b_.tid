Offloading {[[About]]} into [[/b/]] for preservation.<<ref "2012.12.22">>

* Read the parts of me you want to read. If you don't like something, then don't read it. But, that's on you. I'm not responsible for that. I will read everything I write.
** I have the right to dismiss your opinion when you dismiss mine. Tit-for-tat. //Lex talionis//. I will extend wise hospitality to you, but not reckless vulnerability. 

* If I am both data and algorithm, belief and inference, then it is wise to be fascinated by my own computation.

* h0p3ful
** I should write when I'm most like h0p3, most hopeful, etc. When I am most willing to work fairly and kindly on the axioms and plot embedded in my narrative.
** I should write the major content pushes while I'm high. I'm the most communicative, open, willing, and creative that I can be in those moments. I'm going to be reading, thinking, editing, and picking it apart when I'm not high as well. I need both.
*** Use your spice wisely, h0p3.
** I must be fascinated by what I think because that means everything. 

* I am a somewhat incompetent phoenix. A new fire has started from my old ashes. I protected that Tiny Flame of h0p3, nurtured it, and now I aim to cultivate it into the Great Fire of h0p3.

* Demosthenes and Locke, but without influence.

* This is a Library & Information Scientist (particularly a Catalogers) wetdream nightmare.

* What is beautiful about visual art is that anyone with eyes can appreciate it. Unfortunately, it is not easy to read this wiki. Few if any will ever appreciate it for what it is. It feels solipsistic, but not by design; it's just an unfortunate coincidence. It is part of my moral luck that people around me might not love my thought as much as I do. 

* God has no plan for you. You have to plan for yourself in the midst of the chaos.

* Vault seems important here. Talking to myself, advising myself. Obviously, I can only draw upon what I know or have experienced (at least to start). "When people give you advice, they are really just talking to themselves in the past."

I kissed my mouse today after I cleaned it up my wife. I have never felt more precise with an instrument, an extension of my being. It is not ergonomically good for me, but I love it.

So you don't like who you created. That is neither my fault nor my problem.

<<footnotes "2012.12.22" "What a fascinating move. I clearly had no plan, and I'm glad I did something with it. I must admit that there's something special about aiming to preserve something inside the wiki when I know I have snapshots. I'm very pleased to have [[/b/]]: all too often it gives me time and space to come up with an answer.">>
