title: About this Letter

How are you going to read this? 

I don't know. 

I hope you will read it through many times. I hope you will inspect it from every angle. I hope you will carefully weigh my words. I have faith that you will.

Please take me literally in your reading. I'm convinced I mean exactly what I say in this document. This document has been carefully planned.<<ref 1>> This is the best explanation of my thoughts that I can give. It's the best way I know how to say it.

This journaled wiki-letter is odd.<<ref 2>> I feel like I need to apologize upfront about its oddness. It is often the case that I don't know what I need to say to people or how to say it. I hope you do not take me to be condescendingly preaching to you, snowing you, or acting like you don't know what I'm talking about. You may already know most everything in this letter. I know you are brilliant people. I hope you are not offended by it. Admittedly, I don't know how you are going to respond to this letter, and I take that to be a strong sign that I have a poor [[theory of your minds|Theory of Mind]] in some crucial respects. It is a result of being [[autistic|My Autism]].

Again, this letter is odd, and communicating this way is just awkward. To some eyes, it may even be cringe-inducing. I'm sorry for that oddness and awkwardness. It is the result of quirky (to put it generously) communication and social ineptitudes and underdevelopments in me. In tragic ways: I don't know how to talk to people. It is a deficit that I'm trying to make up for, and unfortunately for us, this is the only way I know how. 

I realize that formality in a letter seems weird and impersonal. I mean zero offense by writing you a formal letter (quite the opposite in fact); if it offends you, then I am sincerely sorry. This is me taking our relationship seriously. I am giving you what I consider to be my best form of communication (that doesn't make it good), where //I literally say what I think as carefully as I can//. I am prone to very poorly express what I think or mean otherwise. 

It must be said that writing often lacks the innate emotional and guttural aspects of speaking in-person (it fails to activate particular faster-acting parts of our brain in the right way). Writing also lacks body language, auditory cues, vulnerability, and even some feeling of authenticity that in-person conversations seem to have. Writing comes off as passive-aggressive and feeling too controlled. And yet, writing is sometimes the most effective, useful, and likely to succeed communication option in many contexts. This may be one.

Reading and writing give us a chance to dwell on the particularly vexxing aspects of the intellectual objects at hand. It enables us to evaluate in an emotionally-detached way, which is sometimes necessary. It gives us the time and safety we need to create hypothetical spheres in our minds to test and prod a theory or concept. It aids in our analysis and bias removal. It gives us the chance to think without having to come up with a response on-the-spot as we must in-person. Reading and writing allow us to be reflective in a necessary way.

Revisions of this letter caused me to formalize it (and move to the wiki). Over the years, I have found formal writing to be my clearest mode of communication (that doesn’t make it clear though) because it gives me the chance to piece together, structure, translate, and nest fragments of emotional and complex thoughts lost in my intuitions.<<ref "3">> I get to ask myself: “Is that saying what I really mean?” 

Tools like wiki-pages, parentheses, and footnotes provide the side-conversations, contexts, and worthy tangents I need to expose in order to express myself. Sometimes, when I say a word, I unknowingly have a lot of specialized meaning packed into it, and the wiki-format helps me see what I need to unpack. Formality allows me to control my emotions, to clarify myself, and to have a better chance of conveying the bare kernel of what I really think. Writing this wiki-letter is the best space for me to draw out my reflections for you.

Ultimately, I am not an innately skilled communicator (this isn't to be uselessly self-deprecating). It is just obvious to me. I know what it feels like to be naturally talented at something, and communicating isn't that for me. In my eyes, there is a huge gap between what I understand/experience/feel/cognize and what I'm able to convey to others. That gap is there for everyone, but I think the proportionality of the gap is simply larger in my case than it is for most folks.<<ref "4">> In my eyes, there are certain kinds of people who can say what they mean, who can explain everything they know, who express themselves in a way that suits others in a fitting way, who don't have a major gap between their innerlife and their outerlife (which includes what they can effectively communicate to others). I wish I could do what they do.

For starters, I sometimes lack the social programming necessary for gutterally-manipulative rhetorical skills used to reach the hearts of people.<<ref "5">> I also have a difficult time connecting the dots (and knowing which dots I need to connect for others), explaining my train of thought (while following a set of social conventions which seem foreign to me), and essentially, providing a detailed and well-organized piece of writing which transmits the representation of my thoughts into the minds of others. Whatever skill I have is not innate and programmed in me, but the result of hard work (I don't have the opportunity to rely upon a fully-functiong faster-acting part of my mind right here). No matter how much I practice it, I will significantly fail to convey the web of my real thoughts.<<ref "6">> I think this is the result of [[autism|Autism]].

I’ve found myself unable to appropriately transmit my thoughts to you. I rely strongly upon my subconscious intuition (which is well-trained in some ways and so poorly equipped in others), and unfortunately, the result is continually failing to make myself explicit to you. I’m hoping that through writing this wiki-letter I will succeed where I have failed in-person, but I recognize that I may still fail. 

So, I'm asking you to give me a chance to show you what I mean. Try to understand. I beg for your emotional and intellectual [[charity|Charity]] because I have taken risk trying to reach out to you. I think having the chance to study my carefully structured communication will give you insight into the theory of my mind and further enable your [[empathy|Empathy]]. 

Finally, I write with love because I’m too much of an asocial animal to effectively communicate what I need to say in-person. I hope you can hear me. I hope this letter makes sense.

<<footnotes "1" "I’m committing what is conventionally an error by having the main body of a letter as the skeleton, and using wiki-pages and footnotes as the meat of the supporting argument. The goal is to have the plainest language essence of what I mean in the main body while affording us the opportunity to clarify that plain language with technical or topical depth outside the main body of the letter.  We can't afford to have a linear conversation at this point, so please bear with the medium. I hope you see the merit of the choice. If there is a left-to-rightness in the reading order of this document, I suggest reading it from top to bottom with footnotes (taking care to read the entire page), then exploring links on that page in the same order, and taking care to understand each link in the context of the paragraph and sentence that linked it. Think of it like having a bunch of side-conversations which branch off the main letter. If this article is the first link you've explored and you have already read the main body of the letter, then you are following the intended order.">>
<<footnotes "2" "I don't want to give you a wall-of-text that feels like a prison (for my writing+thinking style or your reading+thinking style). I also don't want to lose the distinct sincerity and simplicity of the plainly worded main body of the letter. Hopefully, the wiki-letter format helps in these respects.">>
<<footnotes "3" "Unfortunately, sometimes I am caught up in my internal frameworks and systems, and I regretfully don't have the energy or capacity to emerge and/or appropriately explain as is often necessary. I'm deeply inadequate in at least this way.">>
<<footnotes "4" "Again, not meant as some delusional humblebrag.">>
<<footnotes "5" "As an example of this rhetoric manipulation of our 'lizard brains,' I see makeup and dressing-up as obviously irrational (in a particular a way) yet effective in communicating and dealing with others in the world (thus rationally instrumental in another way). I do recognize that some people claim they wear makeup and clothes because they have a personal sense of style, an aesthetic of their own, and they enjoy art and beauty. I do not believe these typical human behaviors, however, stem entirely from a desire for artistic expression. Rather, that is likely a confabulation, and instead people have convinced themselves to do these things because they have subconsciously recognized the social utility and mobility in these behaviors. Crucially, appearance is usually morally arbitrary (i.e. Jesus really wouldn't care, and if we are all being ideally moral, we wouldn't either.). Yet, there are pragmatic (borderline egoistic) reasons to put on your war-paint and dress-up, and that's because people won't respect your personhood (sometimes conceived of as human dignity) if you don't. From a utilitarian perspective, one must manipulate lizard brains (the hearts) of others to get them to do the right thing for you (I still find it gross from a Kantian perspective). In any case, I lack these skills, and I have a justified revulsion to certain aspects of them. I still need them though.">>
<<footnotes "6" "Again, we all have this problem, but I think some experience it to a greater degree than others">>
