!! Audit:

* [[Charlie]] is not doing well. The people that can do something about it know.
* Plenty of Fireman Time!
* We've been watching a bit more, I think. Glad to start up BB. I think GoT is mostly for [[k0sh3k]], and I'm glad that we can share it with her.
** We continue to give our kids the best introduction to the stories which matter to us that we can, imho.
*** I am envious that my daughter remembers more about //R&M// than I do now. It's a great memebase for discussion.
* Few dialectures this month, and more pointing+answering. 
** Perhaps that's part of why they have been so productive!
* I am so grateful for my children working hard. They do schoolwork, wander outside, cook and clean, talk with us about important matters, digest valuable narratives, and take care of themselves in crucial ways.
* Getting plenty drunk.
* Watched and played some junk. Cool.
* I like medding with my wife.
* I'm glad we played chess.
* [[SLT]]'s letter, the dryer, [[m16]], and the systemic fungal infection have been the low-points, but we've had a productive month. The kids keep growing, and our relationship has been good. Hardships and all, I think it's been a great month.
