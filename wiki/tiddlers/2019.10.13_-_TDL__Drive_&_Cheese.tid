* Take wife to airport
* Write, write, write.
* Try to sleep. You will manage your wife-withdrawals like bigboi.
* Ebay
* Sort your closet, put away cooler, etc. No reason to burn space.
* Crack whips, inspire construction of something.
* No idea what we are eating. Probably just keep it simple, unless we do pizza.
** Hard to beat pizza. Cheese! We can eat cheese anything.
