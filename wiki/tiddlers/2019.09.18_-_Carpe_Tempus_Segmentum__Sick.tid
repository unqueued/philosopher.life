title: 2019.09.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sick

* In a blur, woke at 11.
** I'm not sure I even slept.
* Fireman Time!
* My stomach has gotten worse. It's too much today. I couldn't handle my public children. I require a functioning gut to have the spoons for people. I've been sick today.
** This is a huge difference with my offspring more generally. Our norms, interests, and interactions can be effectively joined or accomplished, often enough, even when I have little in the gas tank. I can be off balance or worse and we still click. My offspring are a source of stress for me, of course, but they are a pleasure to be with.
*** Perhaps one of the largest differences is their ability to concentrate in the dialectic with humility. Sometimes, we'll go for 15 minutes where I'm dropping bombs across the reality map in multiple disciplines, and they just listen. They actually pay attention. It's funny, cause they know when the dialecture is coming. They gather into a comfortable lounging position which also signals active listening (I do not know how they do it), usually switching to the couch or pacing with me. Sometimes they get something to eat or drink as we talk.
*** I don't feel like I'm wasting my time with them. Even in radical disagreement, it's so fruitful.
*** There's an exceptionally wide range of emotions too. Sometimes it is the most gentle thing, othertimes we're just laughing, and othertimes it's memetically violent.
*** I must ask "where were we?" or "where are we going again?" or "what was the question we were answering?" or "which step were we on?" or "what was right before/after this point?" constantly. It's schizophrenic, and they put up with my insanity so graciously. It's like they maintain the waypoints, and I steer the ship.
* I think I've been getting like 5 hugs and kisses a day on average from my offspring. Lol. Yeah, that's pretty awesome. =)
* My son opened the warren today. 
** God damn did we have some technical discussions today. This was graduate school dialectics in intentionality, teleology, phenomenology, language, and intelligence. I adore how we cover so much ground; it's like lightning. There are gaps there which take years to fill. I am overjoyed to hear such truly educated questions. Those intuitions are not easy to accumulate.
* Called in. Delp thanked me for letting him know. =) 
* Took the offspring grocery shopping while we continued. 
** It was an expensive shopping day. $330. It is getting more expensive to feed my family. In part, they eat more. 
* Came home, passed out. Feeling like shit.
* Wife woke me up.
* We chilled on couch, spoon and talk.
* Sushi, Regular Show
* Read+Write
* Chat with [[GB]]
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3:30
