How's your day going?
MON 1:29 PM
Pretty good—testing most every class!
MON 1:29 PM
Noice. =)
MON 1:30 PM
MUAHAHA
MON 1:30 PM
Lol
MON 1:30 PM
I think symbolic logic was my favorite class to grade for. It was fun to build compact tests that covered everything and could be graded in one sitting. Automated homework grading too.
MON 1:32 PM
As much as I value the written word, I've never been comfortable grading it.
MON 1:32 PM
Yes writing can be really hard to grade —I avoid it like the plague
MON 1:33 PM
It’s too hard to be objective
MON 1:34 PM
preach
MON 1:34 PM
those who have graded my grading tell me I either expect too much or too little; that sounds about right, lol.
MON 1:35 PM
Even with math, I try to make sure I grade all of my papers at the same time so I am in the same mood for each paper. Sometimes I have to go problem by problem bleh but it’s still better than essays
MON 1:37 PM
That makes sense.
MON 1:39 PM
I try to submit my applications earlier in the day simply because there are higher chances of getting a call. Justice as fairness in grading.
MON 1:39 PM
I appreciate having the opportunity to fail 30% of my students.
MON 1:40 PM
(fail and drop*, rather)
MON 1:41 PM
How'd shopping go yesterday?
MON 1:42 PM
Shopping was good —I need to stop at Sam’s but I can do that on Tuesday
MON 1:43 PM
Now the cooking begins...
MON 1:43 PM
I imagine you have organized this on paper, lol.
MON 1:46 PM
So much timing involved in cooking
MON 1:46 PM
Yeah I do... otherwise my brain spins
MON 1:54 PM
Cooking is just chemistry you eat
MON 1:55 PM
:grin:
MON 1:55 PM
Going to try out this carrot cake cheesecake cake... hope it comes out good
MON 1:56 PM
Image attached to message
MON 1:56 PM
That sounds amazing. I adore cheesecake and carrot cake. I have never considered combing them, but that seems like a really good fit.
MON 1:57 PM
It sounds really good
MON 1:57 PM
I promised [[JRE]] I would save him some if the cookies
MON 1:58 PM
And Rebecca some French Silk Pie...
MON 1:59 PM
Have you ever thought about doing the molecular gastronomy route?
MON 1:59 PM
(I'm not joking)
MON 1:59 PM
It looks really cool but I haven’t messed with it yet... really never thought about it. I have seen a lot with Top Chef and other programs but that does sound fun. I shall have to research it and figure out where to start!
MON 2:01 PM
What a good idea!
MON 2:01 PM
If you could send me a list of resources you want, I will try to get them for you (unless you'd prefer me to try my hand...but I have no idea what I'm doing).
MON 2:02 PM
Ok let me see where to start...
MON 2:04 PM
Remind me after Thanksgiving :face_with_rolling_eyes:
MON 2:04 PM
Part of Wednesday (cooking day) that I love is spending time with [[L]], [[AG]] and [[K]]
MON 2:06 PM
Indeed. Cooking with our kids is awesome.
MON 2:06 PM
They all love to cook —I may use the new kitchen at the church since it has three ovens and more space
MON 2:07 PM
Makes sense.
MON 2:07 PM
And the food can just be stored there for the next day
MON 2:07 PM
That's the way I'd do it.
MON 2:09 PM
Yeah should be easier
MON 2:09 PM
