title: 2018.08.16 - Prompted Introspection: Speaker For The Dead

!! Remember the last time you spoke to a person who later died.

I don't remember. I assume I don't actually know the last time because I'm not aware of their death. Even with that awareness, I'm having a hard time coming up with any example. My grandmother from [[MWF]]'s side sticks with me, of course. I couldn't tell her that I believed in heaven, and I couldn't agree. I sat in silence trying to listen to her. I didn't want to make her feel bad.
