title: 2017.04.25 - Pipefitting Log

There isn't much to say. I'm on break. I thought I would be using this time to study, but I'm not. I have other practical fish to fry.

I'm still abstaining from cannabis so that I can eventually pass a drug test. I won't be done with buttwelds for at least a month. I may or may not be able to pass after 45 days. Of course, I will test myself before I even ask for help finding a job (or hunting directly). We'll see. It's tricky, considering my consistent use. I hope to pass the drug test and go into pipefitting. 

I think I should take a cut in pay to do pipefitting instead of just any construction job. I really want practice. Think of it as a form of interning. 

I am reading through my labor movement books. I just need a few talking points really. The history, in itself, isn't actually very interesting. I need to show that I have a grasp of the major story arc, some book specific (prove that I read it) information, the philosophical implications, and how it applies to us today.
