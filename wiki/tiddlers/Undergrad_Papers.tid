title: Undergrad Papers

I started college at 14 with a terrible education. It's been a violent climb. I did well with what little I had. I think what I'm most pissed off about is how little of my work survived. I just didn't think it would matter to me. I've even thrown away my notebooks, lol. Of course, this is bullshit! It's //my// bullshit though, and I need to remember it.
