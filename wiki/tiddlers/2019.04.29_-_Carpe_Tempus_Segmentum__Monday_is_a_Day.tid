* Work

* Talked with bro
* Walked with wife
* Peanut-based Thai food
** Strong, but delicious. Surprisingly, better as a leftover.
* GoT
** My wife was hilarious too. Her pupils were dilated, her mouth did that thing, and she was completely into it. I adore her abandon. The kids and I still enjoyed the show, ofc, but talked about it the entire time (we are, like, the worst).
