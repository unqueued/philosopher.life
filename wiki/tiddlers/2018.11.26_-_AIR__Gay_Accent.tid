Hey, it's monday!
MON 1:34 PM
You having a good day off?
MON 1:34 PM
Yes I am. Went grocery shopping, filled my gas tank up,  cleaning the house and doing laundry right now.
MON 1:36 PM
How is your day going?
MON 1:36 PM
Noice. That sounds very productive.
MON 1:36 PM
Yep about to smoke a bowl and chill in a min
MON 1:38 PM
My day's going well. It's been productive (though not as productive). Should be starting that minimum wage after school job soon. Doing the paperwork tomorrow.
MON 1:38 PM
I read about that last night. I am super happy for you! i think it will fit you well.
MON 1:40 PM
I'm still going to be looking, since it's part time and doesn't pay. It is better than nothing though.
MON 1:41 PM
School is right down the street.
MON 1:41 PM
what about the DCS position?
MON 1:45 PM
anything on that?
MON 1:45 PM
I'm moved onto the next stage.
MON 1:45 PM
I remeber reading you passed the 2nd stage what is the next step from here?
MON 1:45 PM
Btw, you should be see the contents of HTPC through Kodi on your computer.
MON 1:46 PM
Just add a UPNP device. It will show up for you.
MON 1:46 PM
I don't know what the next step is.
MON 1:46 PM
... i didn't understand any of that
MON 1:47 PM
It's up to them to figure that out
MON 1:47 PM
Want me to login?
MON 1:47 PM
Once it is set, it is set.
MON 1:47 PM
not today tomorrow im off. we can do tech stuff then
MON 1:47 PM
Oh, I thought today was your day off.
MON 1:47 PM
im wanting to just chill today
MON 1:47 PM
Ok.
MON 1:48 PM
it is i have two days of in a row
MON 1:48 PM
rare but happy
MON 1:48 PM
Noice.
MON 1:48 PM
I don't want to have to think today haha
MON 1:48 PM
Aye, that's why I offered to do it for ya.
MON 1:48 PM
fair enough,  but I like talking with you through the whole thing and learning about whats happing as you we go along. I see it as you and me time long distance style. would you be willing to wait tomorrow?
MON 1:52 PM
Of course.
MON 1:52 PM
cool! thank you
MON 1:52 PM
May be later in the day because I'm shopping and doing all the paperwork/drugtesting
MON 1:52 PM
I will run on your time for sure when ever is best for you.
MON 1:53 PM
whenever*
MON 1:53 PM
Ill root my phone tomorrow then too.
MON 1:54 PM
Neat.
MON 1:54 PM
You already looked into that?
MON 1:54 PM
so if something happens that I dont understand i can ask you lol
MON 1:54 PM
It will be something you will want to research
MON 1:55 PM
and have all the files prepped
MON 1:55 PM
heard I will do the research tomorrow and on a slower day do the root.
MON 1:55 PM
unless i can get all of it done tomorrow im in now rush and don't care to replace apps and spec on the phone.
MON 1:56 PM
Might be simple just for a root. I usually install a TWRP and flash LineageOS.
MON 1:56 PM
no* rush
MON 1:57 PM
question. my phone can place all my text through signal. would that help me in anyway?
MON 1:58 PM
I did that for a while.
MON 1:58 PM
I stopped.
MON 1:58 PM
why?
MON 1:58 PM
Signal does not make it easy to backup SMS.
MON 1:58 PM
ahh
MON 1:59 PM
nvm then lol
MON 1:59 PM
hey
MON 11:15 PM
yo =)
MON 11:15 PM
How goes it, sir?
MON 11:16 PM
have you watched this?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3997238/
MON 11:16 PM
No. It sounded too gay to me.
MON 11:17 PM
lmao!
MON 11:17 PM
lol
MON 11:17 PM
i fugued lol
MON 11:17 PM
Is it good?
MON 11:17 PM
its interesting
MON 11:17 PM
What made interesting?
MON 11:18 PM
it*
MON 11:18 PM
I have been practicing on  my way of sspeaking daily to sound less "gay"  for about a year or so. and didn't know this existed and just thought it funny.
MON 11:21 PM
I find that i get better opportunities and jobs when I do so( which fucking sucks)
MON 11:22 PM
I believe I have heard that in your speak.
MON 11:22 PM
Ah, that makes sense.
MON 11:23 PM
I'm sorry =(
MON 11:23 PM
you have to learn to code heteronormatively
MON 11:23 PM
yep
MON 11:23 PM
lol
MON 11:23 PM
but the movie was interesting to see another gay man go though something similarly
MON 11:24 PM
Aye. I can imagine it's very useful to see someone else experience it.
MON 11:26 PM
I am curious to know how many gay people even think about this or know how they sound. (not trying to round every gay person into this category but i do see a mass population of gay men have a *gay sound*)
MON 11:28 PM
I would bet most do. I think everyone thinks about their accents, right?
MON 11:29 PM
I don't know? I feel people are less self aware   each day. I don't think people really know how they sound until they hear them selfs recoded.
MON 11:31 PM
which comes back to snapchat and things like that
MON 11:32 PM
where many use it and you can hear your self
MON 11:32 PM
but I don't know or think it registers
MON 11:32 PM
I may be and probably am wrong
MON 11:33 PM
Yeah, there's something to not knowing what you sound like from the outside. It seems natural.
MON 11:33 PM
like for me in me
MON 11:34 PM
when I speak naturally
MON 11:34 PM
what i hear is not what others hear. I feel i sound like a man
MON 11:35 PM
but when listen to a recording of my self I can hear the difference
MON 11:35 PM
Aye
MON 11:36 PM
I have known for a long while know that you don't actually hear your voice when you speak
MON 11:36 PM
but its a weird little revaluation when you record your self
MON 11:37 PM
I know i sound "gay" and i don't want to.
MON 11:38 PM
It's an interesting problem. There is, of course, the Kantian part of me that thinks appearances should play little or no role into how we reason about others as best we can. Our lizard brains give way to inferences and behaviors that aren't moral. Yet, of course, my consequentialist reasoning is going to scream out: but you have take your predictions of how others view you into account.
MON 11:39 PM
I have the same thinking.
MON 11:40 PM
it fucking sucks lol
MON 11:40 PM
The odd part is that it is the Kantian part of our brain that JUST IS the lizard brain. =)
MON 11:42 PM
and the reason i don't want to sound "gay" is because it does hinder my potential for better positions( insert sex joke) and jobs.
MON 11:42 PM
at least well-trained Kantians*
MON 11:42 PM
I think it is a topic worth researching.
MON 11:43 PM
and (of course, because I always say it) you should write about it too!
MON 11:43 PM
To what extent ought you (in your position) hide the fact that you are gay.
MON 11:43 PM
You already have for a long time in various contexts.
MON 11:44 PM
I don't hide myself
MON 11:45 PM
..
MON 11:45 PM
hang on lets talk on the phone if you can
MON 11:45 PM
nvm i think your phones deaid
MON 11:47 PM
dead

My brother called me up. We talked about the movie he watched. He thought about the nature of having a gay accent and being punished for it in his context. We talked a bit about his new phone. He decided not to root for now. That makes sense.
