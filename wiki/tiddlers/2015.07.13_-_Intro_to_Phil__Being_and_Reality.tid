title: 2015.07.13 - Intro to Phil: Being and Reality

Reading for Philosophy:

    Mark your books as you read them.

        You should especially mark the sections of a text that you want to quote in your papers. The major moves and definitions that an author makes, you want to provide their exact words in your paper, that way you can show you aren’t twisting their words or meaning, and that you really have mastered what they are trying to say.

    Take notes as you read (and/or write in the margins)

        This will help you digest what you are reading. This shit is complex.

    Read secondary sources, summaries, and analyses about your primary source

        Don’t reinvent the wheel, but give credit where it is due.

        Nothing reasonable you say will be new, but that’s fine: this an Intro class.

            Right now, you just need to get your hands dirty and dig deep.

    Form your own summary; be able to explain the gist of the argument in an elevator speech

        Outline their argument. Understand the structure of it.

        As you can fill in that summary, looking at the inferential moves, assumptions, and consequences of the authors argument, you’re going to find problems.

            WRITE THOSE FUCKING PROBLEMS DOWN. EXPLORE THEM!

    There are 4 standard, general kinds of problems in philosophical dissection of an argument or text:

        Show where giant, perhaps unreasonable, assumptions are made by an author.

            If the author shows that X leads to Y which leads to Z, that might be all fine and dandy. But, why should we accept X in the first place? There may be major assumptions, like T, U, and V, to get to X that we shouldn’t buy.

        Show the gaps in the author’s reasoning

            If the author thinks X leads to Y, but it isn’t obvious how and the author doesn’t give any reasons, then point out that gap between X and Y.

        Show the author’s absurd inferences

            If the author think P leads to Q, but you can demonstrate that P leads to ~Q (and therefore can’t lead to Q), then demonstrate the flaw absurdity of their inference

        Show the intolerable consequences and implications of accepting the author’s argument or conclusions

            Maybe the author gives a valid argument for P, back up by some great set of premises A, B, and C. Maybe all the inferences look fine, and maybe you can’t immediately find any fault in the groundwork and assumptions (that isn’t to say there aren’t any), but perhaps what follows from P is intolerable to your intuitions or to other arguments you can give. Maybe P leads to S, and S is really bad, or something we shouldn’t accept for some other set of reasons.

    Your papers can’t simply be you regurgitating what other people have said about a topic. I need your thoughts and your voice. I worry you’ve “mailed in” some of your posts, but you won’t get away with that on your paper.



Being and Reality

    Ontology

        Study of Being and Reality

            It is still the combined study of physics and metaphysics (even the book implies otherwise). Philosophers were some of the first physicists and metaphysicists.

            Physics

                Scientists

                Philosophers still use this information

                    E.g.

                        In our everyday discussions of philosophical problems. If you don’t have an understanding of gravity, you’re gonna have hard time with meaningful analysis of any anything which assumes it.

                            Practical reasoning, ethics, etc.

                        Quantum mechanics, for example, may have something to say about free will.

                        String theory, or additional dimensions, or even alternative universes are important considerations in ethics, logic, and metaphysics

                Many believe this science requires metaphysical commitments

            Metaphysics

                Philosophers

                “After” physics.

                    Beyond

                    “That’s so meta”

                Identity, time, types, kinds, categories, substances, particulars and universals, monads and compounds, relationships, sets, parts and wholes, properties, objects and subjects, causality, etc.

                “Being qua being” – the nature of existence itself.



The Allegory of the Cave: Plato, Republic

    Aristotle was perhaps on of the inventors of what has become modern science, and he was also the first to systematize the study of metaphysics. Aristotle wasn’t the first. Plato did it before him (often, Aristotle is responding to Plato). That said, even Plato wasn’t the first. There are pre-Socratics and religious texts which definitely provide ontological theories, etc.

    Forms

        Explain, e.g. beauty, deskness, and redness.

            Forms are the essence of particulars

        The Good

            The noble form

            Like the sun, it is the light which shines upon everything – making everything else intelligible, knowable, and real.

                Draw a silly picture on the board.

            The Good is the basis of doing philosophy. Ontology and epistemology, for Plato, are deeply entrenched together (and, “what is” comes before “what we know” for Plato).

        The Divided Line

            Analogy:

                Particulars:Forms::Shadows:Originals

            Ordinary, everyday objects are imitations of forms. They partake of the forms. They exist solely in virtue of the form. You can’t have a shadow of something without the original to produce the shadow. Same with forms and particulars.

        The Allegory of the Cave

            Ascent of the minds, from Cave-dwelling-prisoner/slave to philosopher.

                What are you going to say: “it’s elitist”?

                    Try arguing against it without engaging in philosophy. Philosophy is the root of how we answer questions, you can’t escape doing it.

            Summary:

                We are all stuck in a cave, as prisoners and slaves to ignorance.

                    Our world, the ordinary world of particulars, is like the cave.

                    We have fire (it ain’t the Good, what is it?) that illuminates things in the cave.

                    We see particulars like the cave-dwellers see the shadows.

                    We are enslaved to the shadows in the way that non-philosophers are bound to only have a minimal understanding of the particulars around them.

                        We do not see the originals casting the shadow, and non-philosophers don’t see the forms of the particulars.

                            Again, only a philosopher who sees the forms has real knowledge for Plato.

                            If we only look at the shadows, the particulars of the world, then we only form second-hand opinions and not real knowledge.

                    The ordinary, everyday world of particulars is a prison-cave. Our minds are trapped by it.

                        This is kind of Matrix-y

                Our goal is to free ourselves. Importantly, freedom means not just leaving our chains behind, but leaving the cave. We need ascend out of the cave, out of the ordinary world of particulars, into the world of the real and the universals, the world of the forms.

                    The goal is to become philosophers with knowledge, not mere shadow-based opinion.

                    Particulars are grasped by our senses, but the forms are grasped by our intellects.

                Emerging from the Cave

                    When we first exit the cave, we are almost blinded by the brightness of everything.

                        (It’s so beautiful and good!)

                    At first, we can only look at reflections in pools of water.

                        Reflections still aren’t as good as looking at the real forms, but they are still a step closer than shadows.

                        Reflections are an intermediate step, probably mathematics. Helping us think about universals rather than particulars.

                        Mathematics holds a place of esteem in philosophy above the empirical sciences, but it is also the step-child, since some believe it almost like game of deductions about mere numbers (that the contents of the study aren’t important enough in and of themselves).

                            Mathematics has a beauty to it, but it is perhaps too obviously instrumental in value to some folks.

                    Eventually, we can see the light of the stars and heavenly bodies (the forms).

                        Yay, we are philosophers now.

                    Finally, we will eventually be able to see the sun (the Good).

                        The pinnacle of understanding.

                        The ultimate source of truth and reality.

                        All other things are illuminated by it.





Individual Substance: Aristotle, Categories

    Aristotle makes fun of Plato a lot, and rejects significant Platonic concepts. They still agree on a hell of a lot though. Aristotle is also an essentialist, but doesn’t go to the extremes that Plato does (although, Aristotle is still going to be an extremist to modern, ordinary eyes).

        Aristotle has his own conception of metaphysics and reality

    Aristotle primary disagreement with Plato in this arena seems to spark from a grammatical shift between subjects and predicates, and taking sides on which has primacy.

    Substance and Quality

        What does it mean “to be an X?”

            What does it mean to be a horse?

                Doesn’t it need a certain range of colors? Or not?

                What if I cut off a leg?

                What if I gave it horns?

                What it lacked internal organs?

                What if it is made the sounds of a whale instead?

                Are there intellectual and personality aspects of a horse?

                What if they didn’t behave like we normally thought of as a horse?

            How do we know when one species ends and another begins?

        Individual substances, particulars, are the units of being

            They exist in their own right, by themselves, and in a way, independently.

            They are the subjects and predicates.

                Predicates, Properties, Qualities

                    Beauty, redness, deskness

                On this view, predicates are dependent upon subjects. Predicates are second to subjects.

                    The can’t exist on their own. This is an outright disagreement with the Forms.

                        It doesn’t have to be though. I don’t see why Aristotle couldn’t accept the forms, but simply keep them as secondary.

            Individual substances can change. They can “come into being” in a special way. Their status of being is special in the ability to change and still “be themselves”.

                If redness becomes blue, it’s no longer red.

                    There are shades of red though.

                Can receive contraries (be one thing at time X, and the opposite predicate at time X+1)

            Must be “of” an individual substance

        Essentials and Accidentals

            To be a species of something requires a set of essentials.

                Horseness has some essential features

                Horses all have horseness.

                    Horseness may be a collection of essential predicates or properties or qualities.

                But some horses have certain accidental qualities while others don’t.

            Universal essences

                Like forms, but they don’t exist on their own. They exist in the individual substances.

    Individuals have primacy over universals for Aristotle. This is due to a grammatical shift in subject/predicate.

        Note, however, that Aristotle and Plato are both deeply concerned with individual and universal.

        They are both concerned with change, being, coming being, the eternal, and the unchangeable/immutable.









Being and Involvement: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time

    This work might sound like gibberish to you. Like we’re wasting our time. Please don’t make the mistake of thinking that’s all it is. I did that once. I thought this was stupid, useless, and impractical. Only years later did I realize that I was ignorant and arrogant in dismissing it.

    We only have so much time in this class, so I’ve had to skip huge sections of the history of metaphysics here. If we had time, we would especially spend some time investigating Kant’s critique (he’s famous for forcing radical shifts in many branches of philosophy, but he’s also very hard to understand – he’s quite systematic).

        Much of metaphysics between Aristotle and Kant focused on “describing the reality as it is in itself.” That is the ordinary way of thinking of reality.

            This sounds mystical and deep, almost fluffy and useless.

            How do we know “what is?”

                That “knowing” part is where consciousness comes into play, and our consciousness might somehow be a part of exists and how it exists and how it appears to us.

            Kant gave us reason to believe that how we are conscious of things is part of understand what those things are.

                Consciousness might be intertwined with reality itself.

                Heidegger agrees with Kant (in a very strong way perhaps) that “how we see or understand” reality shapes reality, in a sense.

        The Kantian shift was radical, and in conjunction with Descartes (and Husserl’s) views, we see a new movement emerge in philosophy called Phenomenology, which really came into a full-formed maturity with Heidegger.

        Being and Time is one of those philosophical works will last a thousand years. It is a turning point in human thought. This work isn’t normally taught, but I think you deserve to see it. It’s that important.

    Being and Time is, frankly, unintuitive to many analytic philosophers.

        Besides the horrible writing style of continental philosophers, this work is one of the major fault lines dividing continental and analytic traditions.

        It’s really hard to understand; those Germans, amiright?

        Heidegger is making a radical shift like Kant and Descartes did, and he’s carrying us past the gateway of phenomenology (opened by Husserl) into a new kind of philosophical science of consciousness.

        Heidegger has built his own little language here, neologisms and portmanteau’s, which the German language is adept at doing.

        That said, once you get into it, you’ll find it is remarkably intuitive.

            Hopefully, you’ll have some “ah-ha!” moments where you say to yourself, “I’ve experienced that before, I know what he’s talking about!”

    Forgot to mention with Descartes: A priori vs. A posteriori

        (lit. "from the earlier") vs (lit. "from the latter")

        Rationalism vs. Empiricism

        Heidegger’s work focuses on the a posteriori, imho, but not in the way that other empiricists do so.

            Heidegger fucking hated standard science and technology. Also, he was a Nazi. Brilliant in some ways. Sad in others.

    Here’s the gateway:

        Descartes put epistemology before ontology. He had this radical doubt, and he tried to find what he could be certain about. He failed.

        Along comes this mathematician turned philosopher, Husserl, who opens the gateway into phenomenology further. Husserl wants to study what we can be certain about in consciousness. He wants to know what consciousness is like for all conscious beings. Husserl “brackets” those things which Descartes doubted, and sets them aside.

        Heidegger is Husserl’s star pupil, and Heidegger just gives up on the certainty issue. He’s just fascinated by Husserl’s internal investigations of consciousness.

            Importantly, Heidegger takes the Cartesian epistemology before ontology, and decides that we should have been doing ontology all along.

            What we are “conscious of” just is reality.

                In a sense, he thinks he is reversing philosophy back to the ontology has having primacy over epistemology stance, or something like it. Like he’s using Descartes to switch back to Aristotle.

                Whether we are scientifically and objectively speaking living in a Matrix, Heidegger doesn’t care. He cares about the study of consciousness from a subjective, personal perspective.

            What’s it like to be a conscious human?

            What are the ways in which we experience consciousness and think about our consciousness?

        So, again, phenomenology is about ontology, but that ontology isn’t concerned with the normal physical substances of the world, or forms, or any of that….it’s only concerned with what we are conscious of, and how we see the world.

            Thus, the subjectivity in Kant’s argument is manifest in Heidegger’s phenomenology.

    Vitally, Heidegger distinguishes Ontic from Ontological

        Ontic

            It is the descriptive characteristics of a particular thing and the "plain facts" of its existence.

            What is ontic is what makes something what it is.

                Empirical science

                Perhaps Aristotle’s Substance fits here

                It is the objective, external, independent, facts of what a thing is.

                It is the usual metaphysical explanation of thing.

            The ontic just isn’t that important to Heidegger.

            This is what we usually mean by ontology in analytic philosophy. It is what metaphysics is thought to be about.

                Heidegger was a on a mission to destroy metaphysics. He hates the ontic. He think it isn’t real philosophy.

        Ontological

            When the nature, or meaningful structure of existence is at issue.

            When you questioning what it even means to exist or be, rather than pointing out the plains facts of something, that’s when you are doing real ontology in Heidegger’s view.

            Ontology focuses on the formal study of Being.

                Thus, something that is ontological is concerned with understanding and investigating Being, the ground of Being, or the concept of Being itself.

                This “being qua being” or study of being in itself is the real punch that Aristotle delivers in his metaphysics, but we didn’t have time to look at it. Heidegger is bringing us back to this.

            For an individual discussing the nature of "being", the ontological could refer to one's own first-person, subjective, phenomenological experience of being.

                This is really at the heart of what Heidegger is doing.

    Subjectivity of Phenomenology, “Thrown-into-the-world-ness” or “Throwness,” and Existentialism

        This first-personal investigation of being and consciousness is just what Phenomenology is about.

            Instead of trying to give objective explanations, definitions of categories and substances, the study of essences and accidentals, etc., this study goes entirely down the subjective path.

        Phenomenology begins, in a sense, with each of us being “thrown into the world” as conscious entities.

            We didn’t choose to be thrown into the world, we just find ourselves in it. We find ourselves being aware. It is our plight.

            We are the kinds of beings who are aware, and especially self-aware, and that’s special. It’s what allows us to do philosophy in Heidegger’s view.

            We are the kinds of beings worried about “being” and the meaning of being, and about our being.

        This concern with our own existence is a root issue in Phenomenology, and because of that, some people say that Heidegger is also one of the fathers of existentialism in academic philosophy.

    Dasein

        Some stuff just doesn’t translate nicely, and this is one of those words.

            It is better for us to define it and just use the word…there is no corresponding single word in English for it.

        Dasein is translated as "being-there" or "being-here" (da combines in its meaning "here" and "there", excluding the spatial-relational distinction made by the English words; Sein is the infinitive, "to be").

        Heidegger uses Dasein as a gerund synonym for "human being" or "human entity” which is conscious, finds itself in a familiar world, and in a mood.

        Heidegger does not want to get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as "person," "consciousness," "soul," or "spirit," so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations.

        Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology; Dasein is what being thrown into the world is like as a human.

        What makes a being a Dasein is as follows:

            Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself;

            Every Dasein has an a priori sense of "mineness," or being one's self;

            Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized or “without a world.”

            We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our surroundings through care, concern, and moods.

            Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time.

            Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning.

        Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand what things are and that they are e.g. "My dog is brown" or "Today is Sunday."

            Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities as entities,[15] helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of "Dasein."

            You might, for instance, imagine that a conscious being could have started out doing phenomenology and ontological thinking…But, not us humans. We all start out in this primitive, pre-ontological starting place. It takes work to get to the point where we can do philosophy.

    Being-in-the-world (Co-term for Dasein)

        Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's replacement for terms such as subject, object, consciousness, and world.

            For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome.

        All consciousness is consciousness of something, that there is no consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception).

            Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.

        At the most basic level of being-in-the-world, Heidegger notes that there is always a mood, a mood that "assails us" in our unreflecting devotion to the world.

            A mood comes neither from the "outside" nor from the "inside," but arises from being-in-the-world. One may turn away from a mood but that is only to another mood.

            Only with a mood are we permitted to encounter things in the world.

            Dasein (a co-term for being-in-the-world) has an openness to the world that is constituted by the attunement of a mood or state of mind.

                As such, Dasein is a "thrown" "projection", projecting itself onto the possibilities that lie before it or may be hidden, and interpreting and understanding the world in terms of possibilities.

    Moods, Attitudes, and Modes

        When Dasein fears death as it passes by an accident on the road…that’s a kind of mood. Dread.

        When Dasein is bored, then it has lost interest in the world. It views the world differently.

        Present-at-hand vs Ready-to-hand

            The Primary Moods/attitudes of Dasein. They are modes of being conscious. Modes of our being. Ways in which we approach, view, thinking about, and interact with the world.

    Present-at-Hand

        In the present-at-hand mode, Dasein has (in contrast to “ready-to-hand”) an attitude like that of a scientist or theorist, of merely looking at or observing something.

        In seeing an entity as present-at-hand, the beholder is concerned only with the bare facts of a thing or a concept, as they are present and in order to theorize about it.

        This way of seeing is disinterested in the concern it may hold for Dasein, its history or usefulness. It’s about being as objective as we can be, and trying to remove our subjective point of view in thinking about stuff.

            This is what Heidegger thinks people who do traditional metaphysics are doing. He’s out to destroy it.

        Presence-at-hand is not the way things in the world are usually or ordinarily encountered, and it is only revealed as a deficient or secondary mode.

            e.g., When a hammer breaks, it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand.

            When a thing is revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that which must be repaired or replaced.

    Ready-to-hand

        However, in almost all cases we are involved in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something.

            E.g., a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing.

                It is equipment for us achieve our goals.

                    Imagine some primitive tribal man who has never seen a hammer or a nail. What would he think of the hammer?

                        It might just be trash to him.

                        It might be a work of art.

                        It might be useful as an anchor for his boat.

                        It is what his mind says it is, and nothing more.

                        Equipment is subjective to Dasein

                In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake.

                Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there.

                In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand.

            Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand:

                Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken)

                Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing)

                Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).

        Importantly, the present-at-hand only emerges from the prior attitude in which we care about what is going on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there "in order to" do something.

            In this sense, the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive (like apes), but rather primacy, as in: what comes first, what is independent and most important).

                Primacy refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and "close" to us.

            Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities. It is the foundational mode.

            Only by studying our "average-everyday" understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.

        For Heidegger in Being and Time this illustrates, in a very practical way, the way the present-at-hand, as a present in a "now" or a present eternally (as, for example, a scientific law or a Platonic Form), has come to dominate intellectual thought, especially since the Enlightenment.

            To understand the question of being one must be careful not to fall into this leveling off, or forgetfulness of being, that has come to assail Western thought since Socrates, see the metaphysics of presence.

    Hermeneutics and Different Interpretations

        Heidegger is ambiguous in his writing. He’s difficult to read, and sometimes we might have different interpretations of what he means. There are different kinds of Heideggerians.

            Realists

                Mars Rover, aware of it, is it there? Objective, Subjective.

                Heidegger isn’t denying the objective existence of it, he’s simply ruling it out as part of doing phenomenology.

            Anti-realists



The End of Metaphysics: Rudolf Carnap, The Elimination of Metaphysics

    Kant was a catalyst or a fork in the road. He sparked a choice for us.

        Continentals went the way of Heidegger.

        Analytics went another way…

        Hilariously, both the continentals and analytics sought to destroy metaphysics (they just went about it in different ways).

    Some modern ontologists are often naturalists (this is strictly an analytic view, but it isn’t necessarily the only analytic view).

    Naturalism, taken to its extreme, goes something like this:

        Science is the real key to understanding reality.

        There is nothing supernatural in the world. Obviously, no spirits, Gods, or miracles.

        There are no platonic forms. There are no real categories. Nothing special emerges. There are just piles of atoms in the universe doing what they do, and each of us are just piles of atoms.

        Metaphysics is dead on this view.

        When you think of the numeral 2, you might think it points out the number 2. Note that 2-ness might be distinct from the symbol used to represent it.

            Naturalists deny that 2-ness, the number 2, exists at all.

            It is just a construct.

            Math is a game we play.

            You might find two apples, but this is just our human way of thinking about them. There is no real concept of 2.

        People who talk about metaphysics are talking about fairy tales or perhaps spouting complete gibberish and non-sense.

    At the beginning of the analytics, we have the logical positivists.

        Carnap is a famous one.

    Logical positivism:

        “The meaning of a statement lies in the method of its verification”

            Metaphysics can’t be empirically verified, hence it lacks meaning. It is pointless.

        Positivists desperately tried to make a rule or for it. Here’s a revision:

            “Only propositions which are either ‘true in virtue of their form’ or ‘can be empirically verified’ are true.”

                Either this is a pen or it is not a pen.

                    P v ~P form

                    True in virtue of the form.

                    What is the truth-maker of the form?

                        The reason it is true is because we can empirically verify it, not because of the form.

                        The form is a metaphysical concept, and the logical positivist realizes he can’t help himself to that logical form of an argument because he’s outright denying its existence.

                        So, logical positivism really boils down to this:

        “Only propositions which can be empirically verified are true.”

            What about this proposition though?

                You can’t empirically verify it.
