title: 2018.11.13 - JRE: Flensers

Work has slowed down, so now it's slaughterhouse or drag-up. 

JRE thinks I'm still gravely mistaken about the possibility of E.T. being psychopathic. He offered a solid argument. I think he wants a thesis from me since he is worried that it is merely the machinations and guttural reflexes of a childhood nightmare of watching it the first time, like Rebecca with //It//. I can appreciate that.

My brother and I talked about (*''SPOILERS: DO NOT CLICK''*) [[A Fire Upon the Deep]] which is still sitting on my digital shelf. We discussed the flensers, which sound like the most fascinating part of the book to me. He talked about trees and an AI-ish creature that is superpowerful. I'm interested to hear more. I also wanted to talk more about the computational theory of mind and the dialectic between our limbic system and frontal lobes (or systems 1 and 2, or whatever is most precise here). He had to go though. In any case, I'm enjoying thinking about the details he sees and his instincts about the novel.
