title: Secret Ballots

We must make secure ourselves against corrupting externalities and unjustified influence on election processes.

Anonymity is a Ring of Gyges experience machine, a simulation of ourselves which shields us from many kinds consequences. Anonymity gives us the space to reveal who we really are. Secret ballots are necessary for honest political expression. It is the only means by which to extract our true opinions and force our authentic identities to compete and cooperate with each other in [[The Original Position]]. The Veil of Ignorance can be steganographically and cryptographically generated to some degree, and thus we must.

They say history is written by the victors. We must disincentivize stupidity in humanity, but we cannot punish people for being wrong //tout court//. Election victors must have the integrity not to punish their opposition, and secret ballots help keep them honest in this respect. 

Secret ballots further protect or inhibit some members of society from intimidation, blackmailing, and potential vote buying. We must frustrate powerful interests from unduly influencing or ostracizing alternative perspectives. Secret ballots help secure the voting process against dark-triads. It's important that your boss, your neighbor, and those who have powers over you IRL do not impede your political expression in [[The Original Position]]. 

It obvious that [[Cryptographic E-Voting]] is the our only practical option in the future. We need to collectively build that computer network which secures all elections. We need to make it easy to generate elections that enforce secret ballots, secret from all adversaries. Only cryptography can save us. I do not trust anonymity not computationally generated, but of course, this must be done very carefully.

Of course, we also need cryptographic receipts to be able to demonstrate that we've fulfilled our [[Compulsory Voting]] obligations and have a method to detect voter fraud. Exactly how we can publicly show that we voted without demonstrating how we voted is a serious issue.

The problem of linking one's IRL identity to one's cryptographic political identity is likely a very complex problem. A great deal of thought must given to the best way to structure this. It is possible that we will need to create something radically different from current methods. This is not an easy problem to solve, but it is appears sufficiently solvable. My current suggestion is to codify voting mechanisms into ZKSnarks on anonymized mesh networks.

Ultimately, we may have to carefully build regulated federated agencies and oracles to audit and ensure [[Compulsory Voting]] requirements have been met. I have hope for cryptographic contraptions which can enable partially-auditable secret ballot systems which minimize our reliance upon federation as feasibly as we can.

Tangentially, we can also generate effective open access polls through secret ballots and generate significant statistical evidence on our populations. This will help us inform ourselves about ourselves.

It would be a dream to have some plausible deniability token votes to give false evidence to coercers, but I don't see how that can be done.
