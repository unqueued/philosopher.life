Same.

There appear to be a number of changes that show things at the top of my page which normally wouldn't be there. Your post is literally at the top, and no offense, it shouldn't be there (even though, I'm here responding, which might just be the signal to Reddit's algo that it really does matter).

After clicking on your post and writing a couple sentences, I then opened Home in another tab. The top 4 posts just disappeared. As in: I can't find these posts 3 minutes later in the top 500 posts available to me. That would never have happened 6 months ago. What the fuck is happening? How does Reddit expect me to develop strong patterns of learning how to reason about this tool, how to consume more effectively with it? Is their goal to eliminate my autonomy in shaping my experience here? Are they really improving my drug use here?

Unfortunately, the algorithm for my homepage on Reddit continues to deliver a declining signal-to-noise ratio. Seriously, I keep track of everything I read that really matters to me (a log of all links/articles/memes which make the cut), and it is demonstrable to me they are making my experience worse. Here's hoping they figure it out; I'm willing to accept short-term losses for long-term improvements.

I'd love to have knobs to turn to tune how the algorithm works. I suspect a mix of poor technical planning and shaping the demographic based on monetization goals. There is no alternative though.

While the numbers displayed are fuzzy, perhaps they provide enough information that a third-party can reasonably use their own custom algorithm. Anyone know of any attempts at such a thing?
