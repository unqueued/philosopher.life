!! Respond to the following gem:

The Vietnam War is a classic example of America's propaganda system. In the mainstream media–the New York Times, CBS, and so on– there was a lively debate about the war. It was between people called "doves" and people called "hawks." The hawks said, "If we keep at it we can win." The doves said, "Even if we keep at it, it would probably be too costly for use, and besides, maybe we're killing too many people." Both sides agreed on one thing. We had a right to carry out aggression against South Vietnam. Doves and hawks alike refused to admit that aggression was taking place. They both called our military presence in Southeast Asia the defense of South Vietnam, substituting "defense" for "aggression" in the standard Orwellian manner.

You'll see this appearance of vigorous debate inside an artificially narrowed overton window when most of the media conglomerates which produce most of the media consumed by most of the nation are owned by a handful of players. Journalism, like the pursuit of truth more generally, is no place for us to enable psychopaths to climb perfectly competitive cutthroat ladders.

We've seen this classic example played out several times in my lifetime too. The US "interventions" or "conflicts" are never wars of aggression. I'm from the American South. The pressures to accept these truthy-facts as virtue-signaling patriots are enormous. It causes me to despair.

This is one of the few places where I get to hold hands with Libertarians, at least until we try to explain what it wrong about it. 

Furthermore, it's my duty to offer countercultural, anti-unjustified-authoritarian, and contrarian perspectives and models to the kids I shepherd; no one else is doing it for them. Unfortunately, I'm not able to explain this either. There's such a huge difference between what I can offer my own children as a parent and what I can do at the school.
