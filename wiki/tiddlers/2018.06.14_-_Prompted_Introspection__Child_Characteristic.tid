title: 2018.06.14 - Prompted Introspection: Child Characteristic

!! Given the chance to give your child only one quality as a person, which would you choose? How about if that choice were unavailable, what would be your second and maybe third choices? Why are these so important to you?

Wisdom.

What constitutes wisdom? If virtue is unified (let's fucking hope so), then take its most valuable constituent parts, or better yet wisely build the correct process chain for acquisition of the unified object for my child (in their context, [[irwartfrr]]), and those become my second, third, and so on choices. 

Why is wisdom important to me? Only wisdom can answer that. I beg the question.

My lazy perfect non-answer, broken for you. Go forth and become fishers of men (and titties).
