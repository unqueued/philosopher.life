!! Audit:

* I'm going to continue repeating myself: this is becoming far more about [[FTO]] and like [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] with that [[/b/]]ish stream-of-consciousness.
* I've just been pushing chatlogs when I do. 
** Btw, I just don't see myself automating this unless it's just going to sit in a queue to be brought into the wiki.
* My offspring and I are working on a billion things. It's insane.
* I think I speak more about lacking my offspring here for 2 weeks than I do in [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]. 
* You know how I have a quote and reply to everything kind of style? It often generates unexpected threads, or it serves to create bridges to get my thoughts onto the page with segues that otherwise would not have existed. 
** It has those "remember to remember" memory palace mnemonics going on too. The rhizome grows here. Bind us together with cords that cannot be broken.
* It is obvious that my backbone of the wiki here requires enormous process discipline and more time/energy than most can or ever would want to spend.
* Even when I'm getting curt answers, it says something. I like that. It feels like I'm painting with words sometimes. My mood is on the page, at least for me to see.
* I'm going insanely slowly with [[monster-16]]. This is the best time to start over.
** I've not had the time to be able to respond to [[Sphygmus]], but I'm willing to bet she already knows what I'm going to say on this part. She has an excellent point. The shedding of our second skins is an evolutionary problem.
* Ooooo. I have a Rabbithole. Those are growing increasingly rare. I don't know what that means.
* Ovy has basically disappeared.
* It's fascinating to see how many of the things I'm working on with the offspring today with our computers is what I've talked about in these logs. 
* That was an excellent purchase. Love my pocket pussy
