title: 2018.05.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: Actor Biography

!! What actor would you hire to play you in your TV movie biography, and why?

I don't think there's an actor that I could afford to hire. Do they take zero dollars? Can they pay me instead? Let's say I selected the actor, but I didn't pay; hire but not employ. 

Assuming I couldn't play myself (and get paid for it), especially since I'm not an actor (and awful at all of that), I suppose I'd choose 
Charlie Day. I think he could act the fool just fine. =)
