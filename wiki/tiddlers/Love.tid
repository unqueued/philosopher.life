What is love?<<ref "b">> Love is [[good]]will. It is the moral motivation that acts only on those maxims which assume [[The Other]] as an end in themselves in this possible world. Love is a commitment to [[The Right]], and hence it is our responsibility. Love is [[fideism]] qua [[The Right]] [[irwartfrr]]. Love is the root sacramental covenant; it is the fundamental modal disposition of [[The Moral Law]]. Thus, the existence of love necessitates contingency. Conceptually, you cannot fall in love because you must leap into it.

Everyone likes at least some semblatic reflection of [[The Good]], even if only merely of or for the sake of themselves (obviously, [[irwrongfrr]]). Love is not //like// because, unlike likingness, love is up to us. Love is doxastically voluntaristic. You cannot snap your fingers and immediately like that which you don't like, but you can choose to love. Love is at the epicenter of the telos of freewill because it is the [[good]]will. Love is not merely an appraisal: it is autonomous recognition of objective dignity which merits all subjective respect. Unjustified love is merely the ill-informed appearance of attraction as love.

There appear to be unconscious components of conscious love. Insofar as love is non-cognitive, it comprises the virtue-theoretically habituated set of affective algorithms which form the ready-to-hand [[phenomenological]] attitudinal being toward that which is categorically imperative. Insofar as love is cognitive, it is the present-at-hand computation of [[The Right]]. Love is [[diamond]]ically constructive and [[redpill]]ed deconstructive [[irwartfrr]]. Insofar as love is concerned with a metaphysical supervenience upon objects we can perceive, some of its properties may be ineffable.<<ref "i">>

Heartbreakingly, even as the logically equivalent content of the unified moral virtue, love is necessary but insufficient for eudaimonia. Existential completion found in justified eudaimonia<<ref "eu">> is a matter of moral luck. Love, however, satisfies the requirements of justification because it is justification itself. Thus, binding and constituting ourselves with love is sufficient for achieving the contextually particularized telos of moral agency even if it does not solve homo sapien's hedonic treadmill of desire satisfaction. Love is more than a risk toward a neurochemical reward for cooperative behavior:<<ref "g">> it is intentionality which sacrificially overrides all other reasons, including our own happiness. Love is so robust and radical it defies explanation without losing justification.

Within individuals, love is agape as the fitting sublational fusion of eros and philia. Love is both the assentive discovery of intrinsic value and the self-creation of our will toward it. Love is both a morally justified cause and emergent consequence of the sublation of contraries. Within collective agents, love is unifying through forgivingly retaliating power and perspective decentralization. Cosmically, into [[infinigress]]ive recursion, love appears to be a mode of [[The Dialetheia]] dialectically weaving and returning [[salient]] opposition into harmonic flatness. Love is the construction of our subjective context toward the right relationship with the objective context of all contexts. Love is morally mystical.
