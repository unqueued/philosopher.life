* The parts are here. Do I actually need a pipe?
* Work. Packets seem to be getting done, but you need to make sure they are reading.
* [[Search of h0p3]] seems like it will take quite a while. We're still thinking about it.
** I've been thinking about versioning, but there's no cheap and clean way to do diffs with the tools available.
* [[Power]] is a big rabbithole. I'm glad to try to answer this though. I need as solid an answer as I can give.
* You might consider combing through the dynalist again and again. Try to come up with ways to use tools.
