title: 2019.01.19 - BDS97: Testing Layer 0
type: text/plain

[16:58:03] h0p3: !! =)
[16:58:10] h0p3: That is exciting!
[16:59:07] h0p3: I have another person I am considering asking to help you who. I would not ask until you were happy with the specs, and I want you to tell me if and when I should ask.
[17:00:04] h0p3: The fact is that I am not as good at you at this, and I am your retarded brother in some of these questions. It's like you are rubberduck debugging with me (and I'm honored!).
[17:00:24] h0p3: as good as*
[17:01:21] BDS97: home: sounds awesome
[17:01:22] BDS97: home: and thanks
[17:02:12] BDS97: home: rubberducking is awesome, but what I'm trying to do here is planning stuff
[17:02:47] BDS97: home: I know you wouldn't necessarily get the code, but we can still talk about concepts
[17:03:18] BDS97: home: as for the other person, I think that would be great when we have a prototype
[17:04:00] BDS97: home: this is still very early days, I think I'll go back to learning Rust, specifically the observer pattern and how to do it properly
[17:04:13] h0p3: yes, sir!
[17:04:39] h0p3: Well, I'm honored to even plan with you. I believe in what you are building.
[17:04:54] h0p3: I will try to find a way not to be your useless apprentice.
[17:05:52] h0p3: (You owe me nothing, btw. It is clear that I owe you something though. This is a moral tool.)
[17:06:18] h0p3: If there is something you want me to work on, please do not hesitate to ask.
[17:07:27] BDS97: home: thanks, but just like programming, I don't see work branching off yet
[17:07:34] h0p3: Good.
[17:08:15] BDS97: home: I think I have a pretty clear idea about how the protocol will work, there are three more of those documents incoming shortly
[17:08:24] BDS97: home: that's only in my head currently, but not for long
[17:08:30] BDS97: home: (although layer-2 will be pretty boring)
[17:08:40] BDS97: home: but that's still just the underlying "rhizome"
[17:08:54] h0p3: I stand in awe. I'm having to really think about everything you are doing. I know I cannot see it that far down.
[17:09:03] h0p3: Rhizome is the perfect word. =)
[17:10:49] BDS97: home: agreed, it's the underground, amorphous network that connects everything
[17:11:09] BDS97: home: and all the other plans are going to be based on that
[17:11:47] BDS97: home: I think the next big system after that should be storage
[17:12:15] BDS97: home: the structure of this idea is from when the news were full of Article 13
[17:12:23] BDS97: home: in fact, that's a huge motivator for the Hub
[17:12:52] BDS97: home: Article 13 assumes a client-server relationship and mandates that the server plays the censor
[17:13:07] BDS97: home: if we take out the server, there's no one left to censor anything
[17:13:36] BDS97: home: but with networked storage there's inherently a server (who has the data) and a client (who requests it), even when these roles are interchangeable
[17:13:53] BDS97: home: the solution to this is user controlled encryption
[17:14:05] BDS97: home: we need to make containers
[17:14:46] BDS97: home: uniform sized, with universal locators that don't allow you to open it, but allow you to share it through a DHT
[17:15:00] BDS97: home: if you know the key, you can locate and open it
[17:17:15] BDS97: home: if we make these in both mutable and immutable variants, we could build a lot on them
[17:17:27] BDS97: home: that's the next piece in the puzzle IMO
[17:28:27] BDS97: home: btw this is what I'm currently trying to figure out how to do with rust https://rxmarbles.com/#combineLatest
[20:00:30] h0p3: I apologize for having to walk away. My brother called me.
[20:00:55] h0p3: I absolutely agree with your reasoning and gameplan.
[20:03:33] h0p3: This is a profound problem to solve, and our ability to build arbitrary networks with arbitrary configurations of storage will be absolutely necessary to defeating censorship. Making it impossible to outlaw without taking the entire network down is fundamental.
[20:04:16] h0p3: As long as enough Capitalists are interested in using this technology, it cannot be outlawed. 
[20:04:30] h0p3: There will be a serious question about how this protocol should be advertised at that point.
[20:05:05] h0p3: Any ISP thinking carefully enough will realize this will be antithetical to their goals.
[20:05:28] h0p3: If we can get ISPs to embrace it though, we will be winning.
[20:06:03] h0p3: Diffusing or defusing their legal liabilities might be something valuable to them in some cases. I am not able to see the correct opening here.
[20:16:24] h0p3: This is the Resilio Sync model, imho.
[20:16:30] h0p3: as we discussed before
[20:17:45] h0p3: Mutable (Plaintext, R+W), Immutable (Plaintext, R), Blind Seeding (Ciphertext)
[20:18:35] h0p3: I suggest that when the time comes, we will want to talk about maximizing permission structures as far as we can (or making room for extensibility)
[20:21:03] h0p3: That will buy us the necessary filesystem to build the correct version of Tox,  essentially the possibility of a mail-system (Zawinski's Law), and eventually chan and reddit clones (those these become far more complex). It will likely be necessary for distributed computing necessary for strong search functions.
[20:21:55] h0p3: One thing I like about IPFS is that it is attempting to build a filesystem that is incredibly linux friendly. 
[20:22:13] h0p3: I will be curious to know the extent to which we can provide the bottom layer for tools like IPFS to exist.
[20:24:36] h0p3: It is possible that we will want strong keychaining, multi-sign, R or R+W revokation, etc. I fucking hate PGP, btw.
[20:26:42] h0p3: Anonymous hosting of Immutable Encrypted Containers built upon the T42T principle would defeat a great number of problems. That is the kind of thing which needs to be automated hard on the network.
[20:28:25] h0p3: I am worried about the uniform sizing.
[20:28:59] h0p3: I understand hiding that metadata may be worth it. I wish we could scale it up.
[20:29:17] h0p3: There are tradeoffs here, and maybe there's an elegant solution. I do not know.
[20:31:46] h0p3: Imho, the VPN problems should be solidly solved first. 
[20:32:37] h0p3: We should love the performance of our anonymity and ability to build arbitrarily nested private network topologies.
[20:34:42] h0p3: Only then would remote/distributed storage feel right to me.
[21:32:06] h0p3: I will be interested to reason about how to make the storage as T42T as possible.  I am worried about what kinds of markets might arise here. I could envision, however, a situation in which my Hub would automatically negotiate with a friend of mine to host your content for you. Perhaps I don't have space, but I have a ton of bandwidth.
[21:32:30] h0p3: At first, it will just be about being able to setup personal clouds, I suppose.
[21:47:26] h0p3: I suppose CDN services could actually exist. Some people will buy the compute and setup the trust themselves with their own key. Some might not have the time or inclination. I suppose someone could do it for them for a price. It's kind of like paying for people to seed for you or something. I still want the cheapest route to be contributing to the network directly and having randos hold it for you.
[21:53:33] h0p3: I know there are people that I would want to automatically hand the right to use my distributed computer on Atropos for storage. I know they'd use it wisely.
[21:55:39] h0p3: Planning the Hub is a beast of a problem.
[21:57:52] h0p3: I wonder what kinds of DDOS attacks might exist on this network. I ask my friends to ask all their friends to ask all their friends to burn down a single key.
[21:58:31] h0p3: This encourages us to distribute everything, and we have the means to do that as well.
[22:05:22] h0p3: I am absolutely convinced we need some kind of "VM container." I want my distributed server to be running even when my home computer goes offline.
[22:06:09] h0p3: We will need to compute for each other, not just store.
[22:06:17] h0p3: That is a very hard problem, imho.
[22:06:31] h0p3: A single mistake, one sandbox/jailbreak, and it's game over.
[22:08:37] h0p3: That is ridiculously far down the line.
[22:18:36] h0p3: The end goal is distributed computing that can even remotely match the bigboys at scale. We should be able to donate our compute power to projects as seemlessly as possible. We should be able to ask ourselves, how can I be of most service to Humanity with the resources I've got? Building political voting machines on it would be an example.
[22:24:44] h0p3: It might even be the case that Atropos Hub comes pre-built with certain kinds of things it shares. Updates for Hub, for example.
[22:27:38] h0p3: I'm worried about forcing all users to do something here (even if it was just a default setting). Even with multi-sig, I would not want to ever see it endangered. 
[22:33:36] h0p3: I like the idea of aggressive updates though. Emergency patches should spread through like wildfire.
[22:35:45] h0p3: Perhaps it will be wisest to have multiple governing organizations for Atropos? Like...maybe there are a handful, and I can pick and choose the organizations that have the right to update my Atropos installation.
[00:25:32] h0p3: Oh, that "https://rxmarbles.com/#combineLatest" is neat! I'm slow; can you give me an example of where that will be useful in the protocol?
