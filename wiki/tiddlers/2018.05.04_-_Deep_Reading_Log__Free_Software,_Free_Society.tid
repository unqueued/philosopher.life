title: 2018.05.04 - Deep Reading Log: Free Software, Free Society

!! Intro

Huge fan of Lessig. I'm glad to see the high praise for Stallman. I'm not surprised.

!! Chapter 1: The GNU Project

God damn do I respect Stallman. He's also a complete fucking badass for building GCC. He really did start from scratch. 

I appreciate the legal incentivization of GPL, but I am so completely against IP that I can't bring myself to do it. It is here that I part with Stallman. He actually believes in IP rights to some extent. I do not.

!! Chapter 2: The GNU Manifesto

He's a prophet who changed the world. I am deeply indebted to this man.

!! Chapter 3: Free Software Definition

The "free as in" phrasing is lovely and simple. I don't think it captures the philosophical nuance in the end. Stallman is more of a computer scientist than a philosopher. Insofar as he engages in philosophy, he is brief and quite practical. He spends a lot of time shaping the Free Software image.

!! Chapter 4: Why Software Should Not Have Owners

Solid arguments. Nothing traced back to the origins of these concepts, but that's okay. I'm afraid to say there is also more rhetoric than I would like in it.

!! Chapter 5: What’s in a Name?

I too am deeply disturbed by the attempt to wrestle free software out of political notions and strictly into commercial settings. It's disgusting. I cannot respect Linus for this reason. It is GNU/Linux, and unfortunately, I almost never say it. It's definitely implied in my writing and thoughts, but I'm not overt about it. Perhaps I should be. When I go to describe what Linux really is I always go back to GNU and GPL as the ecosystem of humans and their creations.

!! Chapter 6: Why “Free Software” is Better than “Open Source”

I'm embarrassed to say I've never read these works (only excerpts). Preaching to the choir! Unfortunately, I've had to learn many of these arguments the hard way. I wish I had read them from the beginning.

!! Chapter 7: Releasing Free Software if You Work at a University

I have much stronger words for universities, but I think I have more radical approaches to intellectual property, economics, and education than Stallman publicly presents.

!! Chapter 8: Selling Free Software

Here is where I am not so sure. I want to agree to it by and large. I'm quite concerned about capitalist infections, especially in this space. I'd prefer a hedged conservative approach that errs on the side of caution, of radically making sure it's free. But, of course, I'm a pirate.

!! Chapter 9: Free Software Needs Free Documentation

Preach, yo! Information must be free! I am deeply indebted to software communities whose best documentation is the free kind. 

!! Chapter 10: Free Software Song

Played it on the piano. Uh, no thank you. This should not be in the collection of essays.

Alright, I'm done. I've skimmed the rest. It says nothing I didn't already believe. This book is confirmation bias or lacking the radicality I support.
