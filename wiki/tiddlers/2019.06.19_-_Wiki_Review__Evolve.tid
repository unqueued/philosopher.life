title: 2019.06.19 - Wiki Review: Evolve

* [[2019.06.18 - Wiki Audit: Sphygmus]]
** The wiki evolves. That what it is meant to do.
* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]
** I've tried this half a dozen times and failed over and over. It might not work at all. It probably won't.
* [[Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models]]
** This hasn't been useful to me in particular, but it made me realize how much I need to have some encyclopedic conceptual analysis. Some of my favorite work in the wiki is like that. My definitions already contain the primary arguments and moves. Hence [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]].
* [[2019.06.18 - T-Money: Recommendation Letter]]
** Happy to write it. I hope my brother goes a similar direction.
* [[2019.06.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Read, Write, Talk]]
** Completed. Also, that arousing itch is delicious. Am I officially in masochism territory? Maybe slightly.
* [[2019.06.18 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Bush]]
** Self-crit is nothing I see coming out of [[Saint Chomsky]] very often.
* [[2019.06.18 - Wiki Review: Rescheduled]]
** My wife did some more research, and she isn't nearly as excited now. I think it is just practice now.
* [[2019.06.18 - TDL: Frisbee]]
** Checked. Yay! We have breathing room.
* [[2019.06.18 - Prompted Introspection: The Lotions]]
** Hilarious, all over the place, but right on topic? =)
