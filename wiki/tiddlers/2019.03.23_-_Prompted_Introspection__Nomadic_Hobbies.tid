title: 2019.03.23 - Prompted Introspection: Nomadic Hobbies

!! Tell what you like about one of your hobbies.

I have answered this before: [[2018.01.10 - Prompted Introspection Log: Hobby]]. 

One of my favorite hobbies (practically integrated now into my vocation) is reading on the interwebs. I wish I had started taking the practice far more seriously and systematically when I was younger. I feel like I'm still failing my own children in this. I have failed myself and others so many times in my understanding and pursuit of my hobbies (and I still will; I can only [[hope]] to improve).

It's been cool to build a part of my wiki around some of my surfing practice in the [[Link Log]]; it has created a feedback loop too. I can't say I do a great job, but I can say I work hard at it. I like having the chance to sift, to think about a lot of different views, and to get a feel for [[others]]. To some extent, there is a regression toward the mean in democratic mob rule, filtering, and dialectics. Again and again, I have benefited from the wisdom of the crowds and empathizing with the experiences and perspectives of [[others]]. I am heavily reliant upon thinking about not just an object on the internet, but also thinking about the commentary and metadiscussions of that object. Postmodernism is a flood, and it's an ugly hackish climb for basic survival and progress. I feel like a hunter-gatherer in the desert without spare energy to be all that aware or cognizant because I'm barely surviving while I'm stuck in the [[phenomenological]] mode or zone of hunting. I am ~~like~~ a raw animal in constant crisis. Too often, I have no idea what I'm looking for until I find it, and that includes a profound bias too. 

I'm trying to build my life with hobbies that matter, and I'm trying to build my hobbies in a way that matters too. I don't mean monetizing my hobbies: I mean constructing an identity which is as objectively valuable as I can in accordance with [[The Moral Law]]. There is a way in which even the computation of our moral experience is commodified and boxed, and we must see ourselves as vessels to something greater than ourselves. I must escape the opiates, mere simulations, and unjustified skinnerboxes in order to minmax-play [[The Existential Game]] and its subgames [[irwartfrr]]. The arete of hobbies requires understanding and applying them as projects, instruments, and narratives which dialectically spiral, spawn, sublate, mesh, emerge, and evolve our being toward [[The End]].

Y so cereal? Leisure and freedom exist for a reason. My life has purpose, and [[I aim to do myself and others justice|IA2DYJ]] in how I approach even my hobbies. [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]], sir.
