My brother was disappointed in his LSD trip. We talked about why. I was just as disappointed in ingested DMT (I've yet to smoke it, but I'm 95% sure I can't. I can barely handle even being in the same room with anyone who is doing it.). I think he and I may have hit some of the limits here. That's okay. He did have a good time. 

We talked about computers and a particularly sad video that reminded him of my son. We talked about why I'm investing so heavily in computing as it pertains to not only a practical skill but also the computational theory of my mind which my son will desperately need to survive this world.

My brother and I talked about humor and wordplay. 

I'm glad he called me. I was curious how it was going for him.
