title: 2019.06.22 - JRE: Congratz on the Sex

```
Hey, how's it going?
SAT 5:36 PM
```

My brother called me back. He's doing much better. That 4-hour window of adjustment was dark, but he's not experienced it again. He even had sex! Woot! Congratz. 

He's been at the gym, which suits him, no doubt. He needs an ass to wear pants effectively. Rebecca went with him. Neat.

His bosses, Tim and Tim, are no longer the duo. The meatpacking plant's foremen died or went into a coma in a terrible motorcycle accident. Lower Tim is being shifted over. Upper Tim was apologizing to my brother for his behavior. My brother regularly takes people to task, and it makes him super popular. It is not an easy position to be in for my brother.

We talked a bit about the wiki, and our laps were up.
