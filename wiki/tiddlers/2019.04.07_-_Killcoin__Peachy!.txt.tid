type: text/plain

Oh, life is just peachy.  Just got back from my two weeks in training in NC
18 MIN AGO
How's your life going?
18 MIN AGO
I am glad it's peachy. =)
18 MIN AGO
My life is feeling routine, slow progress.
17 MIN AGO
Routine is good.
17 MIN AGO
My life has always been anything but routine, lol.
17 MIN AGO
Aye. It is relaxing and useful to my sanity.
17 MIN AGO
That's always good.  Any luck on the job front?
16 MIN AGO
Haven't been hunting.
16 MIN AGO
Just working what I have.
16 MIN AGO
Oh, just apply when you see something that looks interesting?
15 MIN AGO
How's the kiddos?
15 MIN AGO
I don't see the value in trying at this point. Just focusing on the kids and the wiki.
14 MIN AGO
The kids are doing well. Ups and downs, but making progress like stairs.
14 MIN AGO
Up three down two?
14 MIN AGO
Aye. Stochastic and hard to predict at times too.
13 MIN AGO
That's understandable.
13 MIN AGO
Kids be kids.
13 MIN AGO
I get back to the office for the first time in two weeks tomorrow.
12 MIN AGO
I bet you are psyched.
12 MIN AGO
Was the training fun?
12 MIN AGO
It was pretty intense, mentally draining.  Kinda cool though, I went with a lady from my office and like 11 other people.  We all stayed in the same hotel and basically lived and worked together for two weeks.  Then all went our separate ways on Friday.
11 MIN AGO
It's was weird.
11 MIN AGO
Yeah, that would be draining for me too. The office sounds better.
10 MIN AGO
It was similar to college, going in you couldn't wait for it to be over then when it came to finally finish up it was like, oh fuck, after this I actually have to go into the real world and apply this knowledge.
9 MIN AGO
Haha.
9 MIN AGO
Lol. Aye.
9 MIN AGO
And all these people you met and lived with are now all going home as well.
8 MIN AGO
But it's kinda good to be home now.
7 MIN AGO
Don't have to spend nearly as many spoons at home, easier to sleep, and I both love and like (most of the time) the people.
6 MIN AGO
hard to beat the efficiency
6 MIN AGO
lol, I'm glad being home means efficiency, damn [[h0p3]].
5 MIN AGO
lol! =)
5 MIN AGO
Watched any good movies or shows lately?
3 MIN AGO
//Inside No. 9//
3 MIN AGO
Kinda like //It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia// has a baby with //Mr. Bean//
2 MIN AGO
Is it British?
2 MIN AGO
Yes.
2 MIN AGO
I haven't watched IASIP
2 MIN AGO
(I don't watch a lot of British TV, but this one clicks)
2 MIN AGO
That is one of my favorite shows.
1 MIN AGO
I often fall asleep to it.
1 MIN AGO
The family adored //Love, Death & Robots//. Animated anthology, beautiful.
1 MIN AGO
I don't like sleeping while shows are playing.  Well, I only use my phone to watch them anyways.  I've heard the Robot one was good.
1 MIN AGO
I only watch shows I've seen many times, and I only keep the sound (I don't like light when I'm trying to sleep). It allows me to let go.
How about you?
12 MIN AGO
Hmm, I'm watching Umbrella Academy right now, not really too good but it's something to watch.
9 MIN AGO
Kind of invested right now, so I'll finish it.
9 MIN AGO
I don't like to leave things unfinished.
8 MIN AGO
I have not tried the show yet, but I keep hearing about it.
8 MIN AGO
Meh.
8 MIN AGO
My wife has that turned up to 11 on book series.
8 MIN AGO
What book series?
8 MIN AGO
Any.
8 MIN AGO
UA?
8 MIN AGO
Ah ok, yeah I like a good series but I prefer the finished ones so that I don't have to wait.
8 MIN AGO
All about that semi-immediate gratification.
7 MIN AGO
The not wanting to leave things unfinished ("No, [[h0p3]], it's not the sunk cost...this is about having the right character" -- I love her arguments and her).
7 MIN AGO
That is wiser than I am.
7 MIN AGO
LOL
7 MIN AGO
So true though, it's not the sunk cost as much as that killer curiosity.
7 MIN AGO
Nawamean man?
6 MIN AGO
I gotchu.
5 MIN AGO
Movies don't seem to strike me anymore (or it's every couple years).
3 MIN AGO
I watched Happy! this weekend too.
3 MIN AGO
That's a good gritty show.
3 MIN AGO
That's because a lot of talent has been taken from movies and moved to these streaming shows.
3 MIN AGO
Grabbing the show now.
2 MIN AGO
I will check it out.
2 MIN AGO
I am not convinced that is the explanation.
2 MIN AGO
But, it's true, a lot of people are doing series now.
2 MIN AGO
I just mansplained it.
1 MIN AGO
You have to accept my conclusion as your own.
1 MIN AGO
That's the mansplaining law.
1 MIN AGO
=)
1 MIN AGO
Game of Thrones ends this year.  Happy to finally get to the conclusion of that since we'll never see two more books from the old fart GRRM.
19 MIN AGO
I came rainbows for the first few seasons. Sad to see the books won't be finished.
17 MIN AGO
Did you read the books?
17 MIN AGO
Or not one for reading junk?
17 MIN AGO
I am not that literate. Too many words and characters for me.
17 MIN AGO
*insert eyeroll here*
16 MIN AGO
Actually, I've promised not to read them to my wife until after the show ends.
16 MIN AGO
(She promised the same to me, and that lasted 2 weeks. Smashed through them instantly.)
16 MIN AGO
I'm looking forward to it!
15 MIN AGO
lol, they were pretty good.
15 MIN AGO
I looking forward to The Wheel of Time series that will be coming out on Amazon next year, maybe?
14 MIN AGO
That's my favorite series.
14 MIN AGO
There's another one that's supposedly modeled after Objectivism that I'm going to read sometime.
14 MIN AGO
I know you being the huge Ayn Rand fan will be waiting with bated breath for my review on those.  :)
13 MIN AGO
Lol.
13 MIN AGO
So are you doing school and work?
11 MIN AGO
School is going to take a back seat for a while.
11 MIN AGO
Makes sense.
11 MIN AGO
Like, be placed on hold.
11 MIN AGO
I'm gonna throw myself into this job for some promotions and movement.
10 MIN AGO
Gotta be the corporate drone.
10 MIN AGO
Then they'll pay for some school if I show that it will help my career with them.
10 MIN AGO
But I think that it has to be after the first year.
9 MIN AGO
Cool, I hope they go for it.
9 MIN AGO
I shall recommend a brief book to you (I buy its descriptive properties, but not its prescriptions): The Gervais Principle
8 MIN AGO
Is that about RIcky Gervais?
8 MIN AGO
It's a sociopath's analysis of //The Office//. It's gorgeous, accurate, and worth your time just to see the show in possibly another light.
7 MIN AGO
Ahhh, I guess I need to watch the BBC version then.
7 MIN AGO
No, American*
7 MIN AGO
Oh, ok.
7 MIN AGO
Then I've seen that one.
6 MIN AGO
I added it to my list.
5 MIN AGO
I read a good one about sociopaths.
4 MIN AGO
Which one?
4 MIN AGO
https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Psychopaths-Saints-Killers-Success/dp/0374533989
4 MIN AGO
It was pretty good.
4 MIN AGO
I'm no sociopath, but I have definitely known some.  I'm more BPD.
4 MIN AGO
The book looks celebratory and interesting.
2 MIN AGO
It's really good.
2 MIN AGO
I'm on a number of spectrums myself. Been thinking about BPD for a while.
1 MIN AGO
Basically psychopathy is a spectrum like autism and just because you're further along the in the spectrum doesn't mean that you enjoy killing and murdering, there's a lot of highly functioning crazies out there.
NOW
The two cent summary.
NOW
I'm pretty entrenched on the BPD spectrum, self-diagnosed of course, wouldn't entrust that info with a professional.
17 MIN AGO
I had this meet-for-coffee thing with a psychologist and I wasn't really interested in her so I just moved the conversation to crazies and basically had a free session.
16 MIN AGO
https://philosopher.life/#E.T.%20The%20Extra-Terrestrial
16 MIN AGO
Well, it cost me coffee, but that was it.
16 MIN AGO
I have a hard time finding a counselor that I can trust and respect.
15 MIN AGO
I'm not even going to try, not in this day in age.
15 MIN AGO
About 30% of medical records (different ones) are stolen each year (last time I looked into it).
15 MIN AGO
Exactly.
14 MIN AGO
Plus that and pretty soon they'll be able to take your gun rights away with the click/stroke of a pen.
14 MIN AGO
I have mixed feelings on that topic. I am in favor of the mass ownership of arms though.  Currently, about 2% of the population owns the vast majority of all the guns.
13 MIN AGO
Violence is sometimes required by [[The Moral Law]].
12 MIN AGO

11 MIN AGO
I have always appreciated your music tastes.
11 MIN AGO
I think you and SOAD have some similar beliefs.
11 MIN AGO
=)
10 MIN AGO
See, Prison Song
10 MIN AGO
Aye.
10 MIN AGO
Violent Pornography is another great one.
10 MIN AGO
SOAD and RATM are near and dear to my heart.
9 MIN AGO
Anywho.  I'm too close to getting to bed to be diving into pseudo-philopolitical debates with you.
9 MIN AGO
Aye. Sorry. All roads lead to it with me. Lol.
8 MIN AGO
That's all fine and dandy but I'm driving tonight muthafucka and I'm putting the car in reverse.
8 MIN AGO
I think I'm going to start writing some short little articles like you do.  I don't think I'll share the majority of them with anyone but it's something I did a few years ago and it seems pretty cathartic so I'll probably start again.
7 MIN AGO
I recommend Tiddlywiki (https://tiddlywiki.com/)
6 MIN AGO
It's free writing software?
5 MIN AGO
I am unable to define it.
5 MIN AGO
It is a Quine.
5 MIN AGO
I normally just use a word doc and save it somewhere out of sight, the other day I used my phone.
5 MIN AGO
It is extremely flexible, you can program it to do almost anything.
4 MIN AGO
Because I was flying and that's all I have.  A laptop is my preferred method but like I said, in a plane.
4 MIN AGO
I run a server on [[monster-10]] and patch into my network with a VPN to access it with my phone ([[monster-14]]).
3 MIN AGO
I would say I've heard google docs is a great cross-device software but it's google after all.
3 MIN AGO
You own your data with this one, and it's far better than any other tool I've tried.
3 MIN AGO
I am TW Apostle though, so take this desert madman's advice with a grain of salt.
2 MIN AGO
Sweet, I'll look into them.  I shall be getting to bed now though [[h0p3]].
NOW
Encryption comes packaged in the basic file already too if that would matter to you.
NOW
Head to bed, sleep well!
NOW
I'll talk to you later.
