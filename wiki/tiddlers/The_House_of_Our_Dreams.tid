title: The House of Our Dreams

//Make it "INEEDIT"//

* Surfaces should last forever, take a beating and a scratching (or look naturally good even when it does), be easy to clean, look naturally good, age well, be anti-microbial, and be poor heat conductor.



* Location
** Near flowing semi-potable (cleanable, non-polluted) water that won't be dried up by global warming.
*** Think about being able to pump this water wherever we need it, and perhaps it would serve as another alternative source of electricity.
**Unlikely to be flooded, avoids natural disasters, etc.
** As secluded as possible while still having the chance to be on the grid if we will it.
** Maximizes privacy
** Have the chance to purchase more land surrounding our house.
** Preferably in the Mountains/Hills with Trees.
*** A house built into the side of a mountain would be amazing.

* The Secret Foundational Sauce
** I want the foundation and general structure to be amazing. 
** It needs to last, be extremely durable, and yet be something we can change.
** I'd prefer to make all the right decisions up front to allow me to deal with unknowns in the future.

* Electricity
** I really want electricity while being capable of being off the grid. One day, I may not have a grid to use. Also, being beholden to no one is extremely valuable. 
*** Types
**** Geo-thermal
**** Wind
**** Solar
**** Watermill, etc. generator
*** Solar Power -> Water catchers
**** If you are going to spend square footage, you might as well do a good job of maximizing it's value. 
**** Build a giant pool, a filterable, cleanable one that catches water. 
**** Build your own reservoir that will last. 
***** Need to do actual engineering math now.
** Built-in Extension cords in the walls: https://i.redd.it/g0hcb02zzurz.jpg

* Bathroom
** Perhaps partially or fully compartmentalized.
*** Time to be creative.
** Two sinks
*** Go fancy. Love your sinks.
** Cabinetry
** Full, door tub. 
** Shower of the Gods!
*** Anti-slip measures plenty.
** Extremely easy to clean or self-cleaning tile or bots.
*** Would be worth my time to figure out a way to push a button and have it clean itself.
** Urinal
** Nice elongated toilet with bidet and rails (for when we are old).

* Barracks
** Extreme utility and capacity.
** Anatomy of a Compartment (Micro Rooms inside of the Barracks):
*** Custom bunk beds stacked to the ceiling to maximize space for both bunks.
**** Using metal and/or wood.
**** Needs to support a lot of people safely.
*** 2 Sizes:
**** Full-Size (couples)
***** 45x74" for Mattress
***** Make it 49x76" for the perimeter (custom walls, essentially).
***** Let's make it 
**** Twin-Size (very thin or copulating couples/solo)
*** Make them comfortable.
**** Nice Gel/Foam Mattresses.
***** Sealed with plastic or something. Might as well make mattresses that last forever. They may very rarely get used. We can keep them clean, and cleanable for a long time.
**** Comfy and warm sheets, blankets, pillows, etc.
*** Storage space/cubbies/cabinets required.
*** Tiny desk/counter/drawer top. 
*** Lighting
*** Electrical outlets, including USB charging
*** Fan
*** Curtains to privatize the bunk.
**Ladders to climb into the bunks.
*** Would like it to be creative, extremely safe, and very durable.
** Tiny full bathroom. 
** Mirror
** Cubbies on the other side of the wall with removal, if not adjustable, slats.

* Decor
** Plant-life with automated watersprinklers built into the house.

Outside the Home:

* The Shop
** It doesn't have to be connected to the house, but I want it very close by. I want it to be amazing.
** Imagine the shop being the first thing we build. Imagine building electricity and gas powered stuff there. We would work on it there. My son and I would go work on the house. We would build a house. He and I would do it from scratch. It would be a house he would know inside and out. He would acquire so many skills and confidence. 
** We could build or buy the parts for a shop at our first house. We could buy the land. Get it all zoned, have plans approved. Get whatever utilities we were going to have there, and fix whatever else we were going to do off the grid. We could move the stuff into place, build the shop. And then, we can grind on the house. If my brother wanted to come over, he could too. It would be a real project of projects. 
** It is possible that I could do it cheaper. I could contract it out. I'll have to think about that.
