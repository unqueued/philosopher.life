I suppose I'm sending this while you are in the middle of school. You might not be able to reply. In any case, when you get the chance: how is your day going?
TUE 11:11 AM
I don't know what time you head to bed. Anyway, I hope you had a good day.
TUE 9:45 PM
Mine was good with a few difficult moments sprinkled in.
TUE 9:46 PM
Hey! You aren't talking to me.  You okay?
THU 12:03 PM
Sorry I am bad at answering my phone . I also canâ€™t bring my phone to school with me
THU 3:36 PM
You know, it seems like the best students I have in my afterschool program aren't allowed to bring their phones to school.
THU 3:37 PM
The phone I got at 16 wasn't a smart phone (they didn't exist), so it wasn't the same temptation or force in my life.
THU 3:38 PM
It's cool to hear from you though! How was school today?
THU 3:39 PM
Good, except that I had 2 test today
THU 3:40 PM

THU 3:43 PM

THU 3:47 PM
I'm doing well. Been working hard on my wiki, homeschooling my kids, and currently sitting with students who have no intention of trying to be constructive with their afterschool time with me.
THU 3:48 PM
The last part sounds frustrating and it sounds like a lot of work
THU 3:49 PM
Lol. I appreciate that. It has been frustrating.
