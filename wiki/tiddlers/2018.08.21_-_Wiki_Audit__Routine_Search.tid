title: 2018.08.21 - Wiki Audit: Routine Search

I need to start building processes to more routinely search and construct through hyperreading my own wiki. I need to write projects and logs which do things given the information I've built. This is what real auditing, in the end, must systematically look like. This is what being algorithmically meta about myself requires.

I have to reverse engineer myself and build from knowledge of that blackbox representation.

[[/b/]] teaches me to categorize and engineer projects, to see my goals more clearly, etc.

[[h0p3's Computing Antipleonasms]] is a thing. Yay!

Most of my auditing has gone into [[JASG]]
