title: 2018.06.12 - Wiki Review: Matrix

* [[2018.06.11 - Deep Reading Log: The Art of War]]
** I'm guessing that books of aphorisms aren't my style (yet?). It's not just appearing beautiful enough to me. Of course, I must be weary of using beauty as some measurement of [[The Good]].
* [[Classical Philosophical Examples of The Experience Machine]]
** I could become an expert on this topic if I wanted.
* [[The Matrix: Characters]]
** I prefer this one story still. It never grows old.
* [[Quotes: The Matrix]]
** I hope this grows to be a treasure trove.
* [[Communities: The Matrix]]
** I tend to find it isn't worth my time to participate in communities very often. Once in a while I do. They are resources, and sometimes I can be a resource for them.
* [[Links: The Matrix]]
** Sparse!
* [[Redpill]]
** How did this not exist already? Welp. Glad I made it.
* [[Books: The Matrix Library]]
** There are many books I need to get through.
* [[The Matrix: Script Commentary]]
** Either this task is going to be super valuable to me or it will be a giant waste of time. Gotta take risks, yo!
* [[2018.06.11 - The Matrix: In the beginning...]]
** I need to use that material at the bottom in my commentary
* [[2018.06.11 - /b/]]
** Yes!
* [[2018.06.11 - Wiki Audit Log: Proxy Voting]]
** Fleshed out facelift.
* [[2018.06.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Extinct Animal]]
** Edited.
* [[2018.06.11 - Wiki Review Log: Round]]
** Difficult but worthy. I'll take it. Sometimes pain is the price of progress, and sometimes meaning itself arises from that pain.
* [[2018.06.11 - Carpe Diem Log: Matrix]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.06.11 - Daily To-Do-List Log: One Day of School]]
** Simple
