title: 2019.06.09 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Place to Eat

!! What is your favorite place to eat?

I assume we are talking about eating food! But, clearly, Lady Melisandre, it's going to be a mixture of my favorite dishes right off your body in some pseudo-immortal virtual utopia world redundantly calculated across a distributed biocomputer maintained in space and on Earth with robots who ensure the integrity, maintenance, and growth of this network. I adore your tits.

Also, as we ratchet down to current pragmatic reality, I really like Knight's Pizza. I adore brooklyn style pizza.
