title: Proxy Voting

Our human representatives just are our federated proxies who vote in our absence. Representatives have long been necessary for logistical reasons; direct democracy simply can't be handled by traditional voting systems at any significant scale. We live in the 21st century, however, and [[Cryptographic E-Voting]] 

Proxy Voting is essentially a "peer reputation" system.

We will be in a position to generate radically different governmental structures.


No matter how strongly we build [[Cryptographic E-Voting]] processes, I'm convinced that users who want others to vote on their behalf can find a way (although, we don't have to make it easy on them). This is a major infection point. How do we ensure people are legitimately trying to participate in democracy while still enabling proxy voting? How do we ensure vote buying and coercion aren't occurring? It is difficult to escape fraud and intimidation.

Proxies themselves also seem corruptable. If I'm known to have 30k voters I proxy for, maybe 99% of the time I vote the usual way, but sometimes I 



[[Cryptographic E-Voting]] makes it unnecessary to use proxies for geographical logistical reasons. For many folks, that is the only reason to allow proxies. 

Representation is a fundamental philosophical problem, and it rears its ugly head powerfully in modeling political structures.




e should build [[The Original Position]] with complex proxy topologies in mind.

Federation is a step to centralizing power, and it should be handled with great care. Presumably, this is meant to be a mechanism by which the total population consent to authorities who have demonstrated expertise and a track record of implementing the will of the people. 


We should also consider split-ticket vote preferencing and other kinds of risk-distribution. 

Here we face the greatest risk in tactical Quadratic Ranged Voting.

Directly electing our representatives is valuable, but so is the ability to elect representatives to vote for our final representatives. We need proxies and remote voting processes.

Proportional representation should be at the heart of democratic federation.

Should proxy-representatives know who they represent? It might be better if they didn't.

Maximizing our representations, ideal political models of our minds through our proxies, could enable more effective plebiscitic referendum voting processes.

We seek social proof.

There are enormous tradeoffs in this function.

We are worried about political alliances, coalitions, corporations, and voting blocs cooperating with each other against everyone else. But, in a sense, this already existed in the voting marketplace. 

People are free to use proxies, but they must be informed of what their proxies are voting for. People have to be continually tested for having taken the time to study their proxies. Anyone who can't demonstrate that knowledge to some minimal extent is not putting forth sufficient political effort. Deferring to authorities we trust is a good thing, but deference without habitual critical analysis is not. This is just part of [[Compulsory Voting]].

Proxy voting adds a profound complexity to democracy, but it also enables back-propagated machine learning and profound representational political semantics to be computed. We requires arbitrarily complex proxy voter chains in order to maximize voter preference. Proxy voting is necessary for the highest functioning ideal of democracy because it allows us to generate arbitrary networks of representatives for other arbitrary networks of representatives. There is great risk and great reward here.

We must individuate our preferences enough to defeat irrational Coattail effects and stagnant incumbency.

We run the risk of enabling cronyism, neopatrimonialism, blackmailed pork, pay to play political climates, psychopathic tactical voting blocs, 

We must leverage trust and social capital we have built in each other as much as possible. I want the people I personally consider experts to be my trusted representatives for a given context. 

Multi-sig Voting blocs will arise. Some will be dangerous minority interest groups seeking a parasite client relationship in our political structures. Some will be disenfranchised minorities working together to seek justice. The free market of elections in a vacuum will give rise to enormous competition amongst emerging corporate political entities of various [[dok]]. We must allow the passioniate majority to defeat irrationally loyal votebanks while still giving a voice to passionate minorities in the face of indifferent majorities through [[Quadratic Ranged Voting]].

[[Secret Ballots]] make cryptographic proxy voting complex. My suggestion is that some members of society will need to give up their privacy and anonymity to act as representatives for others. We voting history of these individuals must be open to the scrutiny of those whom they represent by proxy.

Perhaps it is cryptographically possible for you to see how I spent your vote as your proxy without revealing any other information about my political identity. Even if we can't, we can reveal our cryptographic political identities to each others based on social trust.
