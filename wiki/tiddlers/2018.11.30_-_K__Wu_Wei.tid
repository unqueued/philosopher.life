How's it going?
THU 7:55 PM
Sorry for missing your message. I’m in the middle of the last full week of class. But I’m doing alright. And yourself?
FRI 8:12 AM
Noice. Did Eastern philosophy ever pick back up for you with Daoism?
FRI 9:57 AM
I'm doing well enough.
FRI 9:57 AM
Hope to start my job in a week or two.
FRI 9:57 AM
I liked Daoism a lot. I’m actually working on my Final Paper now. Discussing wu wei in-context of the three treasures.
FRI 10:59 AM
Noice. I bet you’re excited about that. Haha
FRI 11:00 AM
I am excited about it.
FRI 11:05 AM
Still trying to get through all the paperwork of the process.
FRI 11:06 AM
Paperwork is a bitch...

Always. Haha
FRI 11:06 AM
True dat. =)
FRI 11:06 AM
The Wu Wei + 3 Treasure paper sounds fun.
FRI 11:07 AM
One of my struggles with Daoism is that it appears to deny moral realism (though, it describes some very complex things in an elegant way, if I understand it correctly).
FRI 11:08 AM
Yep! I’m using the Tao Te Ching and Chuang Tzu’s writings to expand out on those points.
FRI 11:16 AM
The writing is SUPER elegant and borderline parable.
FRI 11:17 AM
I like to imagine a monk reading it to me as I read it. Haha.
FRI 11:17 AM
Wisdom. Wisdom. Wisdom. I get it.
FRI 11:17 AM
Lol
FRI 11:36 AM
Well, I'd be interested to see your paper if you have the time and inclination to reveal it.
FRI 11:37 AM
Of course! It’s super generalized but at the very least it is informative. Haha
