I distinguish many [[dok]] of rights, including human rights from rights of personhood. I used to be absolutely pro-life in everything, including radical pacifism. I see violence, death, and pain are necessary evils. I'm increasingly convinced the proles will be forced to physically defend themselves (while they still can). 

Even my wife worked as a director of a crisis pregnancy center (which isn't to say we agree to what these institutions stand for now), and it is clear that the solution to preventing abortions is socialism in the first place. Offering people equal opportunity, access, etc. is the only way to combat it. Seriously. Make it so that having children isn't a death sentence for the poor (minus the biological-retirement plans).

Conspiracy theory time: 

The abortion issue isn't just a distraction to divide and distract us from the crisis of capitalism. It's not just about finding ways to "punish" women for having sex outside marriage. I think the wealthy are obviously interested in maximizing the quantity of people in the labor force to suppress wages when they don't think they will have to pay taxes to support these others in their nation through even basic FDR-style demosoc (which isn't socialism).
