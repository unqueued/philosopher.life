title: Autoeulogy

This is perhaps an odd exercise. Much like a [[Bucketlist]], I hope to have a notion of what I want my hypothetical eulogy to read. What would I want said of my life after I'm gone? Of course, I think the pursuit of fame is ridiculous. Likewise, I doubt I'll have much of an actual eulogy (unless that's part of what I want?). What would I want to remember of myself as having accomplished? What kind of person would I want to be remembered as? What would I want said at my own funeral? Even if this is only for myself, it is ultimately a good question to answer.

This is something that requires thought. I'm not there yet.
