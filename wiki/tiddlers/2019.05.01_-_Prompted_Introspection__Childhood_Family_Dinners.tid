title: 2019.05.01 - Prompted Introspection: Childhood Family Dinners

!! What was your favorite family dinner as a child?

The kinds of meals we had evolved as my donors' income rose as they slowly lost their idealism, including their belief and execution of Jesus' words (which is not the claim that they couldn't make more money and maintain their idealism). You will need to point to a specific point in my childhood to give a clean answer.

My favorite family dinner as a younger child was never at home: it was the exceedingly rare opportunity to eat out. I remember supplementing our food by having a fairly large garden, just like the neighbors next to us (though Mrs. Cox obviously did not work in her own garden). I admire that my parents gardened and tried to feed us more than canned food; they worked for that (ofc, I can easily explain why none of that should have occurred as well).

I recall that my brother used to throw his soggy vegetables on the table to my side (understandably). I was the one who got in trouble for it.

Eating dinner with [[MWF]] generally sucked. When half the people at the table are in tears and have pissed themselves but still must sit in it while eating, it's not a pleasant experience. His emotional and physical violence was pointless. The man should never have had children, and his wife is also responsible for it. Our family line should probably end (and I'm responsible for having had more children as well). I can only [[hope]] my offspring will look back and see more value and kindness in our meals.
