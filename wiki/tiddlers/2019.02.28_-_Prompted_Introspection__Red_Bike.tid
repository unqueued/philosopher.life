title: 2019.02.28 - Prompted Introspection: Red Bike

!! At what age did you learn to ride a bicycle?

5. Red bike. My father would run behind me, let go, I'd fall, and we'd try again until it clicked. I had a fairly bad accident, should have gotten stitches, but we were too poor. It is so weird to see how my donors have never coherently handled what we owe to each other even in terms of basic healthcare. It is one of the unfortunate things about the death of our relationship: it recolors everything.
