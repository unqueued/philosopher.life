title: 2019.08.13 - Afterschool Teaching: Fluid

We cleaned up a giant mess of bananas. As the male, of course, it is my job to deal with the most gross aspects of our work. Lol. 

I got an email from Sonya that we have even more online training to do beyond Accutrane. Horroray. Well, I get paid to think about something else while trying to smash through the curriculum. I was handed answers to the test today as well. Found out smtp isn't working correctly on one of my mail clients after trying to forward it to Whitney. 

The opener was still a clusterfuck. Delp handed his work off to Whitney (as the VP joked), and the information is often wrong. That's okay. I'm happy to take care of kids regardless of what their paperwork or the system says. I'm sad to see that some of my children will be waitlisted. 

I took the majority to the library. We did our homework, talked, played board games, and I saw some drawings. 5Af might not be a pleasant person, but she reads! 5AOf (subject to change) jumped in as well, and we talked about her book, cloning, and extinction. I showered my girls with praise for electing to read; and, I talked trash about not reading.

5KR and her brother 6JR were at it like cats and dogs. They were disturbed that I consider my brother my best friend besides my wife. They broached the topic of incest. Okay. In any case, we talked about what life might be like between them a decade from now.

I'm considering getting a whistle. I prefer to be able to gather their attention through speaking and body language, but children rarely listen to me (hell, few humans ever do). 

5HMf was reading. I can tell she reads often by her mannerisms and our discussion. She is a wonderful surprise to me. 

I delivered my usual speech in the lab. 7DM continued to question me further (good!), and I delivered my direct opinion about the policies. Of course, he would agree with me. 

Whitney is working in the office. There's plenty of paperwork to do. I'm so glad it's not me doing it. 

5Tm is turning out to be a PoS. The poor kid must not have a dad who loves him. I will do my best for him.

6CM, cousin of my honored student ~~7~~8HMf, told me he is mindless. We discussed what this meant. He was sharp as a tack, and I am lucky to see his reflectivity. We talked about Saint Socrates. 

I have tried convincing my students to read. Many just hate it. I have no room to talk. I barely get any reading done these days (because I'm legit a hypocritical idiot). 

5ENm is a rebellious and quick SoB. I will do my best to befriend him and be useful to him. 

I hope to grow my Geek Squad. I'd like to have dialectures with them, but their attention spans are awful. I am reminded how much a tyrant I am with my own offspring. They are required to pay gargantuan amounts of attention to my insanity on the drop of a hat. Most people who meet my offspring say they are like small adults in conversation (indeed, they wrestle hard). The chasm between my children at this school and my own offspring is difficult to point out to anyone who hasn't walked that path before; may our hard work pay off.

Some of my shy kids from last year are more open with me after the summer. I have seen the physical changes in probably a quarter of my students; it's only been a few months! 

5TPm and I talked about shop, working on his dirt bike, and the technical school. We were tinkering with the robotics gears for a bit. 

Interestingly, I have a lot of students hanging to the end. The economy must be getting even worse.

6TS went off on a bus to another county without his mother's knowledge. That is just like him.

[[gh057]] and I might be able to have our get together a Saturday after next. I'm going to get him wicked drunk, lol. Also, we talked about moonshine. I aint much of an Appalachian man if I can't make it. I'll need to do that soon.
