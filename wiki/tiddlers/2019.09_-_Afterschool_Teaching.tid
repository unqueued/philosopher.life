* You don't get along with unjustified authorities, do you? 
* They know my answer, but many still ask.
* I've spent a lot of time trying to convince my best students to actively find ways to escape this prison.
* I'm having an easier time acquiring their attention, and the whistle is always there to take back control when I must.
** My brother is so profoundly kind to me. 
*** It's one of the proofs that [[chameleon]] is family. She reads like my brother.
* These are exceptionally long.
** I find myself pacing late at night, feeling and thinking about it again. Sometimes even the next day. 
* So, I planted the seeds of magic, but people aren't really interested in doing it on their own. If my attention is the only reason they will connect, then let's spend it on something that matters besides magic.
* It's a surreal experience walking past [[gh057]]. 
** First, he's the only colleague I've worked beside who has known about this wiki realtime. 
** Second, sometimes it's just the "hanging in there" nod or word. We are humans grinding and trying to make something useful of ourselves for these children. I'm honored to work with him in this prison.
** Third, there's this difference in the pacing and cadence in our work. Sometimes it slips through our fingers.
* Delp attempts to nudge by saying things like "X is open" rather than directly saying "Head to X." There are no effective justifications so far.
** This is standard school hierarchy, and I'm just another object to be manipulated.
** He's an enemy of my children, a warden who manufactured commodified homo sapiens in this factory. He really doesn't give a flying fuck about the truth or being a good human. It's just a show for him.
* This log is insanely heavy. God damn.
