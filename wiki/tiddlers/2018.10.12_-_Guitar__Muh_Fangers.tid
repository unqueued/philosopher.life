title: 2018.10.12 - Guitar: Muh Fangers

I've done a good job of making both sets of fingers burn, no blood yet though. Lol. //The Banks of Iverness// is now up to speed, but still sounds like shit in some places. That's okay! Practice and feel.

Gave //All Through The Night// a shot. Gorgeous song, the version I have is fairly difficult for me (i.e. intermediate), and I never do it justice. 

Hopping around in my sheet music to remember. My hand is cramping badly.

I adore songs of mourning. Blues and Celtic music hit me right in the feels with high accuracy.

//The Rocks of the Brae// is gorgeous. I have a tendency to speed music up (forever a Rachmaninoff whore) beyond what I should (not just to hear it as intended). There's a stretch I literally can't reach unless I completely reposition my hand to the face like a dulcimer. Looks fancy, sounds meh. Neat though. Give me all the sad music.

I'm colorblind, so I often fail to perceive redness, but the bruising on my fingers is obvious, lol.

Gave my son the Grimoire last night. Today, we learned 3 chords and started playing //Down To The River To Pray// together. It's gonna sound pretty sick once we have it down. The timing of the sheet music, imho, is wrong. I'm having to adjust it.
