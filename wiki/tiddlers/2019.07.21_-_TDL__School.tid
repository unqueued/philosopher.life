* Apply
* Make sure my chillun are working hard.
* Probably need to start cleaning off [[m10]]'s browsers entirely so that I can be ready for a transition without having to really worry about transferring snapshots.
* Letters to write, books to not read, ofc. =)
* Roast is today instead. We did sandwiches and soup, and so that meat will go bad if we don't use it.
