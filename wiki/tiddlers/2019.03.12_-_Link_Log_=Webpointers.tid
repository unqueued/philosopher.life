*** I can see why it's only close. They have description and prescription. I suggest they would find much better results if they were to test for "the possibility that homo sapiens can be good" instead. Otherwise, they only select for a particular kind of judgment; agreeableness is also missing the point (it's contextual!). Still, I adore how they are trying for this.   
*** Moral psych needs philosophers. I've read enough of the literature to see they don't understand the conceptual problems. I will suggest that Business Admin taints this; it's about finding a particular kind of worker in psychometrics, which is not the same as being moral.

*** Weird apology. They are moving workers to a for-profit, right? This was never about being open. It was about attracting talent to create private power.
