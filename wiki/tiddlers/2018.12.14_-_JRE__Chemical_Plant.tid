title: 2018.12.14 - JRE: Chemical Plant

My brother started his new job at the Chevron plant. It's more strict on safety than he prefers, to the point that he finds aspects of it illogical (and had good arguments). He likes the people he works with. Had a weird first day with a marfan's coworker jumping into a vehicle to stop it (but the e-brake wasn't working). Dude was crying because it could cost him his job, but it shouldn't.

My brother is eating more healthily. This is excellent. He finished that book too. =) Awesome.

He's coming with Rebecca from the 28-31. I am extremely excited to see them. I think my brother is especially interested in doing things outside the house. I have no idea what we should or would do.
