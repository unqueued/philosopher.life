title: 2018.11.01 - Self-Dialectic: /b/ Contra

My monthly audit for [[2018.10 - /b/]] has asked an important question: Does [[/b/]] stand in some unique contradistinctive relationship to {[[About]]}?

The scalar, calculus kind of issue here. The stream-of-conscious present vs. the long-term narrative. I do not know how to balance, integrate, and weave them well enough. They can easily sit in tension, and I do not know how to prioritize or even mechanically reason effectively enough about them. Parfit and the Ship of Theseus are here. I'm not saying anything new, but I should at least be able to point to it.
