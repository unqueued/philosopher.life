I don't mind that the re-write is "on the nose." That's the point.

The purchasing scene is odd. It's interesting how other characters are portrayed so as not so appear to have a rich inner life on purpose.

I'm not a fan of threatre except insofar as it has led to film/video in general and improvements to other arts I care about. The poem/raps throughout this book are annoying.

I don't quite understand how he getting revenge, how he endangers his targets.

Enacting under and enchantment he himself was under.

I think it's interesting how he has turned to his prisoner actors to help make his audience drug-induced prisoners as well.

Okay, it was slow as molasses, but it has been building to this one moment. I'm so ready for it. Take me!

It lost its realism entirely for me. It doesn't just sound implausible; it sounds irrational. I think she botched it, except I would say that POTUS  is currently being blackmailed for various similar reasons. Again, however, this is hyperreal to me. Eh, but that's okay. That's part of the Tempest; it is supposed to be a magical hyperreality. 

I think this is book is clever and serious.

The summarization/dissection at the end is meh.
