Hey! It's a circus but it's going. I'm currently getting a ride back home with a friends mom to MS to buy a new car real quick. In the meantime we've been finagling a buyer for the jeep thats still over in gulfport.

It's all good. Its manageable but so time consuming. And yes! My aunt is selling us her old SUV so the timing is perfect. We were actually borrowing the jeep until my aunt's new car came in. So, again, the situation has been manageable but oh lord the last week has been an absolute nightmare schedule wise.

Ah, good!

Very good! She takes excellent care of her vehicles too! So the SUV is old but only has 80,000 miles on it.

Sweet. I think those are some of the best deals. I try to get low-mileage, but after cash-for-clunkers, it's nearly impossible.
