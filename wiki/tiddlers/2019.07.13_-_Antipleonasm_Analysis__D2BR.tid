!! Respond to the following gem:

It is dangerous to be right in matters where established men are wrong.

I am, of course, very often //write// in all matters, so Voltaire's claim comes as no surprise to me. It is why I often avoid The Establishment^^tm^^ in many respects. It is my experience that deep down, everyone thinks they are right about what matters (even those who claim not to know are stating a kind of knowledge of the limits of their knowledge). Centralized powers actually get to wield their opinions in [[The Dialectic]] with far less accountability than anyone else, and they often have earned that position through <<tag [[Dark Triadicism]]>>and climbing ladders of [[power]] such that they punish those who oppose them. 

It is dangerous to be [[righteous]] or resistant to exploitation, especially if it endangers those who have power (including forcing them to face who they are and having them call into question the validity of their identities).

I fight the paranoia and accept there are costs to fulfilling my vocation. [[WWDD]], be my guide.
