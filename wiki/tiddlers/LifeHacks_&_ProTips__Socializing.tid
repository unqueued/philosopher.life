title: LifeHacks & ProTips: Socializing

Stop Wasting My Time:

* If somebody comes to your door selling a home security system and asks if you have one, always say yes.
* If they won't respect or appreciate it, then don't give it to them.


Appearances are Deceiving; you want to know the truth:

* Don't get angry at people for telling you the truth because they will just lie next time.
* If you are examining nursing homes to place a loved one, look at the fingernails of the residents living there at the moment. Long fingernails (especially on men) would likely indicate that the home is either understaffed or does not care enough to do such a small task.


Game-Theoretic Trust-Building

* If you constantly vent your problems to someone, make sure to also call them when things are going well. Good listeners can sometimes get overwhelmed, and it's nice to hear positive news.
* Let someone know you're picking up the tab for a meal AFTER they've ordered. This allows a considerate friend to order what s/he wants freely and also prevents a colleague/acquaintance from taking advantage of your generosity.
* 50% of a job is just being friendly to the right people.
* When lending a pen or marker hand it over without the cap, you are much more likely to get it back


Being a Hospitable Human:

* If you have a guest bedroom in your home, spend a night in it yourself to be sure there are no annoyances and that it is comfortable
* Got a friend or family in the hospital? Consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/eReader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.


Disagreements:

* If someone doesn't understand something you're explaining to them, treat it as your fault for failing to explain effectively, not their fault for not understanding.


Decision Making

*  If your SO can't make a decision about where to eat, play the 5-2-1 game. You give them 5 restaurants, they pick two, and you pick from those.
** Compromise and Freedom


Communicating:

*  Take pictures of your hair after a good haircut. If you ever need to see a new barber, a picture's worth a thousand words.


Don't Be a Snitch (lol):

* If a server or cashier at a restaurant gives you extra of something for no charge, and you are later asked by a manager if that employee was doing their job well, don't mention that they gave you extra food. It could potentially get them in trouble.
