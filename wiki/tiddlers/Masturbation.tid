//Stroking my self-improvement screed. I desperately aim to apply [[The Golden Rule]].//

I wish it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly.

I'm crying over here.

I've never been happier to have hands in my life, whether for my penis or my keyboard, my hands exist to masturbate.

I can't be Japanese because my masturbation isn't pixelated. I don't understand it; I guess my donors don't carry the pixelated-genitalia gene.

Literally, I'll have spent 40 days and nights masturbating by the time I'm 75 (and probably before then).

My right arm is swole as fuck.

Cliterature. Autoeroticism.

I joyously buy my wife vibrators. The asymmetry between women who use sex toys and men.

Dildo, Tofu; Meat Substitute

Self-sex is my disease and cure.

Self-abuse, imagination, stay away from my socks, gateway drug to fornication.

Why isn't my masturbation more marketable?

Never forget: your cum smells. They can smell it on you. It's everywhere.

Indulgent gratification release defile

Before every important decision in your life, you should masturbate to clear your head.

Sacred experience. Crank. Servicing my unit.

Jesus, take the wheel, I need to masturbate.

Mental masturbation is it's own problem.

---

I breathe, eat, sleep, and masturbate. Satisfying my needs makes me not so hungry. Masturbation alleviates my tendency to undress people. Clearly, this is adaptive behavior.

For me, it's not about ridding myself of old sperm (I got a vasectomy at 22), protecting my prostate, hygienically cleaning out my piping system. It's not about fertility. Give me them drugs!

I probably don't have enough serotonin (surprise!). My depressive symptoms probably have some correlation with my rate of masturbation. Dopamine probably gives me hedonic reasons to live, and oxytocin lowers my stress. I can't masturbate my depression and anxiety away, but I probably construct very temporary reprieves. I can't say I've reconciled this problem at all.

* A man is at the optometrist getting his eyes checked. "You need to stop masturbating so much," the optometrist says. "Why?" asks the man. "Is it going to make me go blind?" The optometrist looks around and says "no, but it's making the other patients very uncomfortable."
* Dad: Hey son, if you keep masturbating you're going to go blind. Son: Dad I'm over here.
