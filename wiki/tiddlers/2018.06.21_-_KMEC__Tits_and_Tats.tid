title: 2018.06.21 - KMEC: Tits and Tats

I have a different target today in this case, but the principle of KMEC remains the same.

I have taken your opinion very seriously. My [[T42T]] axiom is an exploration of what you showed me. Do you really think you've taken the time to see my argument?

You're not as valuable to them as you think you are. You have the potential to be, but you actually aren't. I see your dark-triadic confabulation.

You don't play the game of reason with me because you know you will lose. Ah, don't mishear me. I'm definitely wrong all the time, but in the grand scheme of things, I'm superior in the dialectic. Insofar as you aren't rational or aiming to be rational (which just is rationality), you don't merit respect.
