title: McManus: Walter Benjamin and the Political Practices of the Alt-right

<<<
 Those who have power in society can quickly and cheaply produce ideologically loaded aesthetic works, which can quickly be deployed as tools of distraction and propaganda. 
<<<

Unfortunately, I'm not convinced that most art hasn't historically been rhetoric, but I'll agree that cheap reproducibility can be a profound double-edged sword.

<<<
The alt-right emerged as the product of complex conditions in society, but its first instantiations were online. Individuals felt increasingly alienated in a society which no longer conformed to their expectations, often dealing with disappointment at their inability to live up to the American Dream in a climate of economic decline.
<<<

Having been a 4chan user since 2005, an important axis in the alt-right movement, I think it's possible you've failed to understand the origins and causes of that online community (and even I don't think I can give an effective account). I have to step up and defend at least some minority of individuals in that community which are [[Redpill]]ed for quite reasonable reasons, though they haven't been constructive with it. Economic decline is an important part of the story, but it's an insufficient representation.

This is why, despite its apparent hatred of post-modernity, the alt-right is very much a post-modern movement. Its relativism and distrust of any “truth” but that which flows from the communications bubble is indicative of the conditions of its birth.
<<<

Why don't they get to say the same about your own position? Yes, you'll find truth and moral relativism in abundance; in fact, I'm hard-pressed to find any group that doesn't have this flaw. It's super clear that many alt-right folks aren't relativists; some of them are functional Rand-Locke memeplex psychopaths who agree to not only the description of psychological egoism, but also an egoist prescription. That's not relativism, though it might not be functionally any better.

<<<
Digital technologies, with their capacity to simultaneously open up new spaces for thought while enabling individuals to increasingly live within a communications bubble, meant that most alt-righters never needed to concern themselves with the intellectual salience of their ideology.
<<<

Let me be crystal clear: I hold almost all humans to be just as guilty of this. This isn't something unique or even more prevalent among the alt-right. In fact, I often appreciate that alt-righters fight the mainstream (we obviously need it, even if it's the wrong direction). It's just easier to see their insanity because they're on the fringe. I'm hard-pressed to find anyone that I think really pushes for philosophical integrity, self-doubt, and systematically intervening on their bias.

I hold the mainstream just as responsible as the alt-righters, perhaps even moreso! They are all repugnant. The alt-right is a symptom, and I think you've glossed over the cause.
