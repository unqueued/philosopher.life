* Morning Glory because I woke up early!
* I woke the kids up. They had a harder time waking up.
** It's wonderful getting hugs from everyone in the mornings after I get back from work, and before bed. I love my family! It's gotta be one of my favorite parts of my day.
* I worked hard today, and I spent a lot of time thinking.
* I helped catch baby ducklings stuck in a very dense thicket/garden of flowers that is walled off in the center of campus. Great place to hatch them, except that they couldn't escape (can't jump the 6 inches to clear the concrete barrier). I rarely touch animals except for my cats, especially not of my own volition. It was cute though, and it needed my rescuing. I found the duckling's mom and placed the duckling carefully nearby. The duckling ran to its mom. It was sweet.
* I spent time at the union today. Got to know a few guys and talk about it with them. Also, I crushed some kids' dream who had been welding for years (6 months in the union); he quickly stopped giving me pointers after he saw my stringer. It was a hilarious moment. My "humility" (i.e. socially hidden gifts and talents) drops jaws sometimes. Who doesn't like that feeling?
* Picked up steaks and mushrooms for my wife's Birthday. 
** Happy Birthday, love!
*** While I wish most humans never existed, I will always be grateful and happy that you were born, that you are with me, that you are with us!
* I made a small pizza, played some league, surfed, and wrote.
* Fireman time!
* I talked to JOP, answering some questions she asked me in an e-mail.
* I made a feast for my wife's birthday. It was truly excellent. We got tipsy too!
* We watched an episode of Game of Thrones and chillaxed. The family stayed up late. 
* I did some troubleshooting with my friend ALM on linux.
* I watched a bit of Rick and Morty before falling asleep.
