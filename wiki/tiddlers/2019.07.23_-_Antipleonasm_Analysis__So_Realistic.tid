title: 2019.07.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: So Realistic

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I may still be a kind of a Marxist but I'm very realistic, I don't have these dreams of revolutions around the corner.

Fuck off then. I'm not saying it has to be some Romantic^^tm^^ affair. Defeating capitalism in the 21st Century is nothing short of a deist's miracle. This is akin to just claiming you don't believe meaningful change is possible. I'll agree it's radically unlikely, virtually infeasible even. Slavery is on the line. 

Realism about predictions, i.e. mere descriptions, is one thing, and I agree Marx is wrong here (he simply couldn't have predicted what technology does in our world). Realism about moral expectations, i.e. prescriptions, is another: revolution is necessary.

I agree it's hard to keep a unified Left when the spectrum is this broad.
