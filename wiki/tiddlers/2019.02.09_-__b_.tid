//(Paul is a saint. - k)//

I feel like the Bible does a poor job of giving a metaethical framework. It does attempt to flesh out the content of the moral law; it can gutterally articulate it - but the word wisdom is not nearly important enough in it. That's why there is a progressive revelation at all. Articulating the codification of the moral law particularized to our context just is wisdom. Wisdom is both theory and practice.
