title: 2019.06.28 - Wiki Audit: FTO

It's clear that [[FTO]] is in shambles, and there's no reason for it to be. It's populated, workable, and there's progress to be made. It's ready for the [[audit]]'s digestion to the point of [[The Remodeling]].

I'm cleaning up lots of tagging for users, dumping [[firmcoding]] for tiddlers that are likely to remain static (I can always change it back). This should make it easier on the [[firmcoding]] calculation.

[[Root]] has lost the [[Readme]] tiddlers. Perhaps it will be an honorary [[Root]] tiddler like its constituents now. Also, [[Readme]] is now in the subtitle. I like the way that is set up for [[kicks]], and I think it works reasonably here too.

---

[[Year]] is going to be another kind of doorway. I actually like having a daily systematic look through the years. FB's idea is a solid one. I think this is a reasonable way for me to explore and engage in [[The Remodeling]] as well. If I become adept enough, it will become part of my spaced repetition memorization.
