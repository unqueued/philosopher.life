//In honor of [[Leo Strauss]]//

I have seen many zero-width marks in the wild. It's time I start taking them more seriously. Call me paranoid, but I must remain open to the possibility that this may be useful, no matter how strongly I doubt it. As a [[hope]]ful pessimist, I can never be certain of what the world is or where it's going, hence I continue to develop this suspicious playbook.

This process could be built into many things. It's loud as fuck to someone looking for it, so perhaps it is merely a redflag (some institutions already automatically parse for it).

Similar to {[[Verify]]}, I remain open to gnostic hail-mary pass steganography and shibboleth. I'd rather it were just a fun game. May it never be useful to us!
