title: 2017.08.27 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up late for me.
** Slept on the couch. 
* Fireman Time!
* Watched McGregor lose, as predicted.
** He did better in the first few rounds than I expected, I'll give him that. But, Mayweather is famous for this defensive, drawn-out style. It was inevitable.
* Writing time.
* Took the kids to the waterpark/park thing in JC.
* Tried a new Mediterranean restaurant
* Watched some League, Archer, True Blood
* Talked to my brother JRE.
* Family time.
* Went to bed early enough.
