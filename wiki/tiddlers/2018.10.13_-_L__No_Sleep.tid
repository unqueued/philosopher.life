How are you doing?
16 hours ago
 I’m alright. Not getting sleep again these days.
16 hours ago
 =(
16 hours ago
 I know that feel.
16 hours ago
 Realizing that a lot of my issues with looking for a new job are largely due to self-confidence issues.
16 hours ago
 It seems like I feel as though I don’t “deserve” to be an engineer, that I’m not “smart enough”.
16 hours ago
 Also being tired makes me blunt... as I’m sure you can tell.
16 hours ago
 Do you have anyone to compare yourself to in your engineering program?
16 hours ago
 If by program you mean class, then yes.
16 hours ago
 I still keep in touch with my friends from school — though less so these days. They’re moving all over.
16 hours ago
 How do those who had similar performance to you in school tend to fare in the engineering market?
16 hours ago
 Most of my friends are far smarter than me, but the one I come closest to does okay?
16 hours ago
 I can’t say I know all that well — he’s down in Texas right now but trying to move back up.
16 hours ago
 He also stuck around for the engineering masters program and I opted for my MBA.
16 hours ago
 I suppose I mean more than your friends, but perhaps that is who you know to make the judgment here.
16 hours ago
 I can’t really say I know anyone else from my graduating class well enough to say we performed equally.
16 hours ago
 Honestly, if I could ever go back and tell my younger self to pay more attention in class and study harder I would.
16 hours ago
 I hear that, lol.
16 hours ago
 I think it was all so overwhelming for me that it flew by.
16 hours ago
 Sorry to bring you down with all this by the way. Been thinking about it all morning since I can’t sleep and all. .—.
16 hours ago
 It's not a problem. I'm trying to think about it with you.
16 hours ago
 I have very little context to go by.
16 hours ago
 I'd be interested to see the numbers not just for your particular year, but for the surrounding years as well.
16 hours ago
 Right.
16 hours ago
 Numbers? You mean of graduating engineers that actually get engineering jobs?
16 hours ago
 yeah
16 hours ago
 I’ve never really bothered to look...
16 hours ago
 I wonder where the university would keep info like that.
16 hours ago
 Might ask some professors. Odds are good they someone keeps that data.
16 hours ago
 You have some professional exams you have to take, right?
16 hours ago
 Do engineers get jobs without those exams?
16 hours ago
 Uh, only voluntarily.
16 hours ago
 Yes, all the time.
16 hours ago
 Mostly only need those exams for professional licenses which allow you to do crazy dangerous stuff like build entire buildings and factories from scratch.
16 hours ago
 ah
16 hours ago
 Or for government work.
16 hours ago
 Something something red tape \o/
16 hours ago
 Well, I know the confidence issue.
16 hours ago
 Yeah?
16 hours ago
 You always seems so confident to me. ;p
16 hours ago
 I tend to stick to what I'm confident in.
16 hours ago
 Like a good Bayesian.
16 hours ago
 Hehehe
16 hours ago
 I feel that.
16 hours ago
 Honestly it’s why I’ve been furiously clinging to D&D. It’s helping me cope. Probably not in a healthy way.
16 hours ago
 UGH. Confidence is dumb. I just need to learn to do things.
16 hours ago
 My confidence issue is socialization. I'm highly conscientious and open, but disagreeable. I'm a wizard in some parts of every job I've done, but I'm incompetent in the social department.
16 hours ago
 I am glad I've had vidya games for this.
16 hours ago
 I'm much better solo.
16 hours ago
 That is not how the world works though.
16 hours ago
 I've not found the moral cracks in the system yet for someone like me, though I'm increasingly confident none exist. Evil will always have the competitive advantage (also something I learned in vidya games).
16 hours ago
 Moral cracks in regards to socialization? What do you mean?
16 hours ago
 No, I mean in the world.
16 hours ago
 Oh!
16 hours ago
 Sorry, I misunderstood.
16 hours ago
 I feel the use of competitive advantage was very deliberate there
16 hours ago
 But maybe hearing it over and over again in business school has etched it in the back of my mind.
15 hours ago
 I try to say what I mean; so I'm deliberate in that way. I talk about the competitive advantage of boxing without golden-rule gloves.
15 hours ago
 Truth...
