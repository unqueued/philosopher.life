title: Hidden: Syrian Rue Harmaloid Extraction Tek

//This extraction is meant to ease the body load. I remind you that MAOIs have dangerous interactions with other substances.//

Ingredients:

* Syrian Rue
* Water
* Vinegar


Process:

# Soak whole seeds for 30 minutes in hot water
# Add water twice seed volume with a dash of vinegar, microwave for 5 minutes, and filter the tea liquid into crystallization chamber
# Repeat previous step four more times (5 times total)
# Finely filter the tea liquid
# Boil tea, and dissolve salt into it
#* 200g non-iodized salt per liter of liquid
# Cool the tea in the refrigerator
# Stir it gentle and let the crystals settle
# Decant top later, then filter the crystal. 
#* You can use a hair dryer to speed it up.

This extraction is for 100g of Syrian Rue. You may scale up ingredients, but do not scale the timeframe.

# Grind the Syrian Rue to a powder.
# Soak Rue powder, 750 mL of water, and 50 mL of vinegar for 12 hours.
# Boil Rue mixture for 30 minutes. Strain muddy tea into a container, repeat step 2 boil (without the soak) with strain of tea, and combine the strained tea liquids.
# Boil tea and dissolve 5g of non-iodized salt into it.
# Pre-mix 500 mL of saturated salt-water solution.
#* Created by adding non-iodized salt to boiling water until it won't dissolve any more. Let the water cool, and filter out salt that precipitates.
#* Approximately 150-200 grams of salt per 500 mL water
# Mix the seed tea with the 500 mL of saturated salt-water solution in a sealed glass container. Refrigerate it for 12 hours.
# Decant/Baster/Syringe the liquid down to the thick layer on the bottom, then filter the liquid into precipitation chamber.
#* Press and filter the sludge's liquid into the precipitation container.
# Redissolve the resulting red gooey mush in 500 mL liter of boiling distilled water and repeat previous step.
# Add a small amount of ammonia to the filtered aqueous harmaloid solution.
#* You will be able to see the alkaloids fall out of the solution, which goes from dark to bright yellow as the alkaloids become visible.
# Let the solution settle over 6 hours, then decant the dark liquid off the top, and filter remaining liquid out of alkaloids.
# Wash alkaloids in in small container, filled halfway with ammonia, shake vigorously, filter and dispose ammonia, and repeat this step until disposed ammonia looks fairly clear.
#* Optional: Before engaging in this last step, dissolve product into aqueous solution with vinegar, filter, and precipitate with ammonia.
