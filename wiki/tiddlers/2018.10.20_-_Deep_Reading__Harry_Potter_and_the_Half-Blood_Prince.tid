title: 2018.10.20 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The Chosen thing is clearly here. It's weird that I connect with plenty of pseudo-Christ figures, but not HP. It's not like I don't have things in common with HP, but I don't feel moved by him in the way that I do other figures like Owen Meany.

Again, the (invisibility) clock and dagger thing. It's a fun mechanic.

I think Malfoy would have done far more than he does here. I also think it's weird that Malfoy's wealth doesn't translate into having more magical objects than he does. In fact, I don't see why HP doesn't either with his wealth.

See...Hermione is the first to succeed. It's bullshit that she doesn't get Outstanding.

Liquid Luck is retarded. That would be used all day erry day by erry one.

It really feels like the older generation were just flat out better at magic as teenagers than the kids in this story.

These magical tools remind me of being a kid walking through magazines and engaging in pretend games with my brother.

How is it that the half-blood prince is more accurate than the book? It legit doesn't make sense.

Oh yeah, I forgot that these memories are modified.

Not taking Hagrid's class seems reasonable enough, right?

Resolving this series likely required a lot of forcing.

How do they make new spells? I have so many questions that Rowling deviously doesn't answer.

I love having the history of our villain. There's really no way to appreciate him without it.

There are a lot of aspects of this story which are fragmented about memory. I appreciate that.

I feel like I'm watching Star Wars.

Dark Triadicism is cleanly displayed. Dumbledore clearly attempted in incite it.

Hrmm...HP makes an inference that I think he could not about the parseltongue fact with-holding. This was forced.

Placebo gaslight (not all placebo is that).
