>I have asked you some very personal questions, and I will continue to do so, nomad.

The repeated use of the word nomad has conjured up a song I had forgotten: [[Nomad Tell Us|https://themusictapes.bandcamp.com/track/nomad-tell-us]] and its repeated admonishment, “You must relate to the earthling mortal!” Haha, it’s so emblematic of reading your wiki!
<<<

Ha, that's awesome!

People are hardwired to be tribal (which is not the claim that we can't override it); it has evolutionary advantages. Of course, we must distinguish what is [[The Good]] or [[The Right]] from what is not, so having an "out" group is not conceptually wrong (or we could not coherently talk about wrongness at all). There is a moral variant of tribalism which I carefully accept. I think objective morality is fully real; daring to be right (highly unpopular) incurs major costs. I do not think we own ourselves to nearly the same degree that most people do; morality is profoundly demanding of us.

In this case, there is also a neurotribal consideration. It appears possible that (for whatever reasons) the human species may be evolving to produce more autistic people (or we are simply more aware of what this spectrum is). I realize many autistic individuals in my neurotribe would be upset by my claim, but I think we are functionally an alien species in some respects. Regardless, it's my duty to treat all persons with respect. As to my moral tribalism's teeth, however, I aim to do my part to destroy unbridled dark triadic memetics, characteristics, and behaviors in the human species through radical empathy, explicit reason, and transparency. I drag the vampires into the daylight of the desert whenever possible.

All of this context to say: I realize you aren't making fun of me at all here, and I appreciate that very much. I really do feel like I'm demonstrably a weird person, and I thank you for your openness to it. Admittedly, my life would be a lot simpler if I could just blend in and code like a neurotypical. It would even especially simpler if I didn't feel I was called to be moral (which is a requirement much, much higher than most people wish to realize, imho).

I listened to the song and then looked up the lyrics (because I have an auditory processing disorder which affects how I perceive lyrics in music). That line really is emblematic. Thank you, sir! I consider it higher praise than you may realize. It's one of the fundamental concepts which my wife shares with me. This exact issue of alienness (something which is at the heart of what at the time was my Christian faith) was how I knew she was my soulmate from a single date. I planned to marry her that night. I wish I had kept my writings about it. Memories fade.

Essentially, on top of trying to understand myself, I've come to realize that I also aim to build a bridge into my mind for my children and Humanity (I predict only my children will use it). I want us to empathize with each other. I'm obviously [[fff]] and perhaps even mentally disturbed (although, I think we should carefully inspect psychological deviance and adaptivity in context, part of my usual [[gfwiwcgws]] considerations), but I think I have something valuable to contribute to [[The Great Human Conversation]]. That might sound truly arrogant and even dark-triadic (I believe some people see it that way). I hope to show there's a method to the madness which is ultimately moral.

<<<
>My wife is a librarian, and it feels like you are doing indieweb-librarian work to me. Do you consider it part of your vocation? It feels like more than just an aesthetic experience to me.

I suppose I will get a little personal then.
<<<

I'm glad to see you getting personal. That's part of [[T42T]] engagement with me (this is a fine intro: https://ncase.me/trust/). I literally want to get to know you, sir. I consider it an empirically derived fact about friendship that we must iteratively reveal ourselves to each other to build cooperative trust and form more accurate theories of each other's minds (necessary to empathize more effectively). I try to make it easy for you to know what you are getting into when considering who I am. Because it can be so difficult to step into my shoes, I prefer to give people an overwhelming chance to think about who I am before they engage me.

Deep friendships are very difficult to form (and not just for me), imho. I wager large portions of the ~100 billion homo sapiens to have walked the planet have lacked real friendship in their lives. In contemporary life, I think it's even harder to build real friendships and fulfilling lives as the Crisis of Capitalism squeezes us through automation and centralized power dynamics into confused nuggets of walking capital ripe for the picking. Many people, sadly, live invalid lives (which isn't to say they are fully responsible for these invalidating, alienating processes).

I aim to help us avoid that problem while fostering what I hope to be foundational practices of friendships in the 21st century (technology does make it radically more complex). I think the world desperately needs it; the world is tearing itself apart. I seek for us to exponentionally cooperate because it's the only way to feasibly defeat the grand iterated prisoner dilemma, which is currently leading to our mass enslavement/extinction. 

I appreciate your willingness to say it out loud. It's a mark of integrity.

My aunt died over a decade ago and she was a library director on the West Coast. I still think of her all the time. But she has been gone so long that I can’t find any of her interviews or papers like I once could. I talked to her once about Ranganathan, who I had just discovered, and she talked about edge cases in categorizing books—in fact, I think I’ll start storing books in an “edge case”—and then she died and I live with the regret of never seeing that promising conversation continue.
<<<

I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like the relationship was a gift. What do you think she'd say now about the work you are doing online and in your job?

I consider the problem of categorization to be a fundamental one in philosophy (and, to my poor understanding of it, also mathematics). Do you mind giving me an example of your edge cases? 

Aside: conventionally, we aren't supposed to talk about our cat's names on the interwebs; it's uncouth opsec.<<ref "i">> Ranganathan is my eldest cat's name.

<<<
But I kept talking to librarians after that—it sates my wish to talk to her still. I had a friend for a little while who was a librarian on Microsoft’s campus. A corporate librarian! She was fantastic to talk about books with.

Librarians are not admired in the same way that teachers are, but their work can be very important. Someone has to sift through the vast sea of words and pluck up the ones worth saving. This is becoming even more impossible today. I sometimes feel like there could be an amateur librarian’s movement—this is what I’d hoped the old Internet “surf clubs” would be—but it truly is a gift of generosity to attempt to organize the world out there. I admire your wife and these others.
<<<

Agreed. Admittedly, I think we all ought to function as librarians in a digital age to varying [[dok]]. I'm not a happy camper about how this process of finding relevance is overcentralized and tied to our exploitation.<<ref "r">> There's a better way, and I think we're in a race to find it. Librarians preserve and generate salience; they shape [[The Great Human Conversation]] through logistics especially, imho. They plant trees whose shade they shall never know. As I said, I hold your work in high regard.

I hope I will eventually have some other kind of respectable librarian ball rolling (previously, I was more of a distributor). I'd like to consider myself an amateur collector and organizer of links (e.g. [[Link Log]]). I see my wiki, in part, as a perceptual tool for helping me access the web outside (and, in part, to define myself with the external). I believe I currently have ~15k outbound links on my wiki. In a way, I'm tired of bookmarking in a browser. It's just too limiting. Don't get me wrong, I'm obligated to engage in browser bookmarking practices (and even shape my operating system around the terminal of the web), but using hypertext in this wiki seems to be the only effective way to tell myself the stories of these links with enough expressivity (and even then, it's clearly lacking). I'm also interested in machine learning about my link collections.

For all I know, I may end up with a million hand-picked links by the end of this wiki's life, and I see them as tendrils of telling myself the story of myself and the world. It's qualia-laden, pregnant with meaning, and overwhelming in the sheer audacity. I recognize it's manic or hysterical in its quest for telic realism. I hope it matters.

<<<
>If I understand correctly, there are diminishing returns in the scaling of triangles for visual modeling.

Well, I guess I thought that more triangles would only improve definition, but this is a great observation.

(Oh, comment about this conversation: we are using a type of embedded reply form here which is quickly growing deep. I wonder how else we might capture this discussion—which might go on for some time—into a large flat structure, simple to read back on, but which might keep related threads together without losing access to the original message. Or maybe these quote-and-reply forms are too restrictive, I wonder if we can sprawl out more.)
<<<

This is the line which caught my eye the most! My wife and I have talked about it several times. I've been pondering it for a while (as you can see). I'm not sure what to say yet because I do not understand it well enough. It's one of the reasons I'm taking so long to respond. Please say more! I want to see what you are thinking. There is likely a problem here I'm failing to envision appropriately (beyond the redundancies). I'm not sure how to improve this practice. 

For my part, I enjoy having the conversation from my wiki, which isn't flat or linear (Can I haz [[Rust]] or an [[Ithkuil]] in this practice?). I enjoy a line-by-line quote-and-response kind of conversational style.<<ref "q">> I tend to provide a couple threads for each thread a person gives me. I think we rhizomatically sprawl across these threads, nest sub-conversations in them, and the result is a flexible and expressive advantage resulting from both of our medium choices. As long as our references clearly point with accuracy, I think we should be okay. If you see a way to improve, I'm all ears. I want to make it ergonomic.

We are having a long-form hypertext conversation, and I haven't had many of those (it appears you may have more practice at this). It's like speaking in a different language to me. It's hard to describe, but I legit find there to be an art (beyond the obvious technological //techne// and standard "art of conversation") in what we are doing, and I hope it's an empathic art. I know I'm working hard to help my children engage in this kind of reasoning with me. I want us to know and interact each other inside and out; I want the most epic bridge of love I could ever build to them, even when I'm dead.

Until we crack the human brain (assuming its philosophically, politically, and technically feasible [none of these being the claim it is ethical]), I think this may be where long-form conversation of the 21st century should go (although, I don't predict the world will do so). I'm convinced there's something right about this: it's how we should shape [[The Great Human Conversation]]. 

I will call it a //[[hyperconversation]]//. It's more than the usual penpalling. There are, of course, irreplaceable advantages to speaking in person, but I think there's something irreplaceable about this long-form style as well. I like having the time to methodically think about someone asychronously from their own frame of reference/mind (rather than some prepackaged, bottable, astroturfable, monetized format curated and designed to addict, control, and extract capital from us). It's a real conversation in a world that otherwise appears all too fake to me.

To be clear, you likely understand me better than the vast majority of people I know IRL (as sad as that sounds), and I think that's in part because you've had the chance to study my own self-representation in the comfort of your own home. How many conversations in your life do you get to have like this? It's an asynchronous multi-threaded high bandwidth exchange to me (in this case, a public one which I hope to grow).

Some of my best instant messenger conversations I have basically require typing while rapidly switching contexts and hyperreading the web. I use my tabbed window layout to spin-up and navigate many FF windows (it's the best system I've found so far), and for a good conversation, I'll have to pull up at least one window in which I'm opening tabs to interpret what they are really saying, to rabbithole, and to extend the conversation. It also reminds me of academic philosophy settings where I'd have to hyperread my notes, sources, and papers in class to contribute to the conversation as effectively as I could.

In a way, this gives us the chance to hyperread and deepread each other. We can't afford to meet in person (I have a beer with your name on it `kickscondor` if we somehow one day do), but we can certainly make do with what we have.

<<<
> I hope that my representation becomes increasingly accurate and useful to me. Even if I fail, I hope to come closer and closer to success on this issue.

Well, here’s one question—how will you endure a drastic change? Like: what if you reverse a core tenant? Or, moreso, could you discover that you aren’t a wiki, but are a different type of information structure? Perhaps you’ve decided you are and that’s the end of it.
<<<

That sounds like the problem of autonomy in general. I cannot provide all the answers to this issue; it will probably take me the better part of my life to give my systematic account.

I don't know how I will endure it, but I hope I will gracefully do so with minimal pain. I believe I am open to these possibilities. I think few people dare to consider that they've lived a lie, that they were completely wrong, that what they thought was real or valuable wasn't, that their lives are largely invalid in significant ways, that they they are bad people, that the world is not what it seemed; they confabulate their way to self-defense of their model at any cost (of course the non-cognitive networks of our minds will react this way). I have made those mistakes myself many times. I [[hope]] I am open to being wrong all the way down. You are free to call me out, nomad.

Of course, I'm still forced to act upon the assumption that I'm right, take risks, and plan long-term with the information I have. {[[Principles]]} are my axioms (recently replaced on this wiki; a large surgical move I've been planning for a while), and I anticipate they will continue to evolve. I know I can be wrong (even if I come across as someone who thinks he's always right). I desperately hope to be right, to live in reality, and that's why I push hard in this direction. Yes, I may experience a drastic change (I hope so), and I hope I have the integrity and constitution to engage in radical existential surgery, self-legislation, and behavioral modification (I feel like my wiki has already helped me do that quite a bit). I talk about it at length in this wiki. The content of my wiki is reusable and {[[Vault]]}ed for a reason; it's //soft//ware that I believe will enable me to snowball my efforts in defining and refactoring my perceptions of myself and the world.

I do have a move fast and break things kind of problem. Some of the changes I've made have taken a year to commit. I can't change everything either. Part of the issue is determining/separating what is mutable from what it immutable. I do not know my degrees of freedom (or how that changes either). 

Perhaps I have not been clear enough (too often my problem). I do not consider myself my wiki, but I think it represents me strongly. Further, I think my wiki and I are highly integrated. I think it's an evolving external representation of the internal (think Kantian epistemology) representations of myself to which I attend. It's a model of a model, and it's guaranteed to be flawed, imho (perhaps I cannot answer the question for you because I consider it equivalent to resolving the fundamental question of philosophy). 

My [[Root]] concept is not easy to see, and I may be delusionally wrong about it. I'm still trying to figure it out.

<<<
You are sort of bumping up against communicating with the outside.
<<<

I think this line must be interpreted and applied in many spheres. I think it's philosophically, not just technologically, one of the key problems I'm attempting to address in the wiki. In a practical sense, the volume of this problem is turned up to 11 for an autistic person too. I may not get to rely upon your rTPJ to mirror my emotions (and to some extent, I can't rely upon my own for myself either, lol). Perhaps you mean something else by it, and I'm trying to see it.

<<<
 I will be interested to see how you sort this out. Your many-meg single page site is so unique and I find the opportunity to download all of it to my computer memory like the visit of an oracle—a single being, sent to deliver the collected wisdom of any query I might have.
<<<

I'm so pleased you see it. Perhaps it is a virtual narrative-avatar container. Perhaps it also serves as a verbose, navigable curriculum vitae to humanity. It seems to give me the opportunity to have a structured one-sided 10,000 hour conversation with an arbitrary number of people (normally, I'd only have the chance to do so with a handful in my lifetime). This unified object has a lot of modes and purposes to it.

I believe it will survive many decades of technological turnover (`/fingers-crossed`). The portability is monumental to me. I can send my self-representation in a single file that runs in what may be the long-term universal, platform-agnostic VM host of the 21st century: the web browser. I will be interested to see how WASM affects it. 

I hope the size problem will diminish (in proportion to presumably rising computational/network resources). I'm sticking to text (and perhaps some Unix principles), and I'm guessing I'll have 5-10MB growth a year. Compression could also take me very far. Despite the collapses of what little net neutrality there has been, it is likely this wiki will remain transmittable and consumable to those who really care for it for a long time to come. I suspect this is the best virtual sneakernet medium available to me as well. There are many nice practical properties of keeping it unified.

Note, I can serve individual tiddlers if I must, but I'd rather not (I could serve the site with very high performance). At that point, I think I'd switch tools (likely to something pure command line).

As I have mentioned, I hope I'm setting myself up to have a powerful machine learning corpus. If there is a vote to be had in [[The Original Position]], I hope some turing machine passing AI built from my wiki will be able to vote for me, automate cooperation, and perhaps even teach and talk to me. Perhaps we can't trust blackbox AI's, but I think one built from my own wiki (using a process I understood) is something I'd risk trusting implicitly.

<<<
So I am happy to communicate however you see fit, because your oracle’s purpose is to organize your thoughts, not to be a telegraph system. My organization here is the opposite: it’s designed to send dispatches to individuals. But I am going to make some small changes to have a tiny oracle as well.
<<<

I can see you are making changes too. It's exciting. I think your syndicatable tagcloud-river concept is creative. In what respects do you hope to oraclize it? What do you hope to accomplish by doing so?

<<<
I don’t think any of these things are technological problems, though. I am happy to drive to your house and ring the doorbell or go to the basement doorway and let myself in—or whatever the protocol is for you. I think that’s what’s so marvellous about your site and sites like [[whimsy.space|https://whimsy.space]].
<<<

I appreciate that. I like having the spice of life in the art we create for ourselves and others on the interwebs. It is something to celebrate. I feel a little bit like an analog craftsman in an industrialized age. I hope our homes remain open and fruitful.

<<<
> I hope you don’t think I’m a snob. I would argue I deal with many unsavories.

I hope you’re okay being a snob! Why would that be so terrible? We all live on a giant graph paper and, speaking for myself, I really like my coordinates. You might just be snobbish about being your own type of unsavory.
<<<

That's a fair point. I'm sensitive to the fact that I'm generally unsavory to people, even when I do my best to mesh with them. 

I can't say I love my coordinates, but I try to appreciate the many excellent parts of my life. I don't think most people have the opportunity to lead the life I have and do. I should aim to be more grateful, particularly in [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]. 

<<<
There is an interesting poem I recently read called [[bulldyke|http://www.juked.com/2008/05/bulldyke.asp]] that made me think of this. The poem itself dabbles in unsavory—are these words disgusting? Are these thoughts perverse? Is the afraid little boy lover in the poem—certainly he’s the unsavory one. (And, also, poetry—isn’t poetry just awful?)

I don’t know, but I like deciding these things. Who doesn’t? I’m a snob, too.
<<<

That is a moving poem. I'm not sure how to react to it. I admire the honesty of thinking about the unsavory outloud in that poem. There's an honesty to it. I'm going to need to sit on it some more. Sometimes that is all I can do with poetry. I regret that I'm basically poetry-illiterate; I've been trying to learn for a long time for my wife though (she sees very far where I am blind). 

<<<
Like everyone else, I hate Facebook and what it has done to the Hypertext Kingdom and I will fight it valiantly and with great, upturned nostrils. But I have also used it to obsessively follow the death of Kaylee (and other children that I will write about some time) and I have depended on this awful unsavory to read their obscure stories. It has filled me with profound spiritual mayonnaisse.
<<<

You are clearly moved. I do not know Kaylee, and I do not understand "spiritual mayonnaisse." I ask for your clarification.

I must admit that I do not predict others will join us on our quest to defeat the centralization of power here, but I have hope in at least the possibility. It's an awful feeling to fight from a position which is almost certainly going to lose. Fight the good fight, homie.

<<<
I should also say that I enjoyed the recent VICE video with a girl in big Sally Jesse Raphael glasses interviewing an Incel. I felt that I really loved both of them. Not in a Jesus way; like the Double Rainbow guy, crying and marvelling over colorful semicircles. I don’t know if VICE is unsavory—I guess I wonder if all businesses are.

Perhaps the biggest worry I have is that I will think someone to be pure and unscathed and godlike—only to discover that they have touched their whole staff in all the wrong places. 😂
<<<

Lol. No, but for realsies, that sounds like a description of The Sublime to me. If Hegel is right, it is possible that [[The Beautiful]] emerges from the ugly (or vv., I do not know).

That vulnerability is hard. I prefer to choose idols that don't live anymore. It's easier to not be disappointed, especially with maximum Straussian charity.

<<<
> I’ve been thinking about a problem which you’ve probably seen a dozen answers to. I have now been asked twice for a way to push notifications of updates. I am worried that my wiki isn’t well-designed for that. I’m not entirely sure what I would push to others (my New kind of does that). I would like to know your thoughts on where I should go with this.

I am happy with how you have things. I understand how you work now. If anything, I would argue that you should continue innovating in the way you have been. That, like the single-page oracle metaphor from earlier, you will find more ways for the technology to symbolically represent you. This is paramount.
<<<

Thank you. Let me also say, I'm enjoying watching you transform and experiment with your site. I see that you called your homepage your root. Your "Ripped Sheets of Paper" title is fascinating. Go on, sir! Elaborate on the patterns, unities, or emergences which rise from the flatness and chaos of the ripped sheets of paper. What is [[The Good]] of it? It's definitely art.

h0p3 - I'm sorry to have taken awhile to reply - and this isn't a reply to 'Hyperconversations' - I will get around to that - this is just a little personal letter. I have no doubt that you will post this on your wiki - and you certainly can, but I would like to encourage you not to. :D
<<<

Please don't worry about apologizing for how long it takes to reply to me. It doesn't bother me (I'm happy that you take the time to write to me at all), and I'm by far the worst offender (I have zero room to complain even if I wanted to). I think it's part of the charm of the asynchronicity of our conversation.

I appreciate your taking the time to write a personal letter to me. You are correct: I am posting it. I hate to disappoint you, sir. I am called, none-the-less, to be a man of principle. I apologize if it makes you uncomfortable; I understand not everyone wishes to speak so publicly. There are costs to being held accountable for/to the identities we expose, and I realize not everyone can pay it with me in all contexts. Of course, this practice puts a practical social limit on who is willing to interact with me.

I employ [[The Categorical Imperative]], and I weigh how I endanger others in this practice, including for my own family.<<ref "k">> I particularize the contexts embedded in my maxims as best as I can. I realize not everyone shares my opinion on the matter. It is your right (and perhaps even your duty) to challenge me, sir. If I am wrong in this regard, then correcting me is respecting my personhood. I appreciate your willingness to do so.

I must ask: do you simply [[FO]] desire to encourage me, or do you [[SO]] desire to [[FO]] desire to encourage me? The difference matters. There is a tension in this letter I've not been able to peel apart. I will think carefully with you.

<<<
It's funny, when I think of writing you, I am always aware that it will be public - which shouldn't matter, no one would read it anyway - but someone could. In fact, hold up - EVERYONE COULD! AAAAA! And that uncertainty makes me put on a 'hat' so I can go outside. That 'hat' is fashionable but unassuming; it casts a shadow over my eyes.
<<<

It's true, very few read it. I doubt the wiki will be read by many people, although one day it may.<<ref "c">> Whether or not anyone else is reading it is somehow secondary to the fact that "EVERYONE COULD." You are right; I've made that point in //Focus://{[[Help]]} and elsewhere. Your analogy is a good one.

You wear your Shadow Hat well, which I've mentioned before. A simple clearnet search of your identity reveals exactly what you've planned to show us. This is no accident, and I can respect that. I think everyone should have your skill. Too few realize what's at stake. I too wear a light Shadow Hat in order to deflect surface trolls, scraping bots, and automated profile building while still making myself incredibly vulnerable in a personal way to those actually reading and thinking about my words.<<ref "l">> As a matter of integrity, I hope not to be private where it matters most (these aren't morally arbitrary characteristics of my identity). Publicly building evidence of who I am is not an easy thing to do.

Let me also say I've experienced ridiculous vertigo over this problem. I believe I legitimately feel your pain. For a long time, I lived in the shadows. I'm an autist /b/tard oldfag anon. You're talking to a man who ran 1% of the Tor network (measured by throughput) and an unknown portion of the i2p network for years on a shoestring budget (lowendtalk budget VPS hunting). When I seed 2 petabytes over seedboxes, I really do rely upon some measure of anonymity and privacy. I'm the dick that insists on using E2EE messaging (preferably federated or p2p) with my family and friends. I'm that free software crusader and anti-intellectual-property zealot.<<ref "ip">>

Privacy and anonymity are concepts and tools that really do matter to me; I definitely have paranoid streaks in me too (albeit, many have been justified and reinforced over the years). I know there are valid reasons and cases in which to maintain one's privacy and anonymity, and that's why I've been a staunch political activist for those legal rights. I also expect people to exercise and fight for them alongside me before we lose them.

Of course, the distinction between what is moral and what is legal is absolutely crucial. I have no respect for morally unjustified social conventions (autism has its perceptual perks). Only [[The Moral Law]] dictates what we ought to do. It's constitutive of the very concept of Reason itself. To that end, I'm glad I opened up. That isn't to say I don't use tools for generating privacy or anonymity (far from it), but I think I have a moral duty to Humanity to start building myself out in the open. I truly wish everyone did. It's part of [[The Original Position]]. 

The shadow over our eyes is a serious problem: I believe it costs us the ability to be cognitively and emotionally vulnerable (even to ourselves). We don't really get to know each other when we are engaged in good opsec (that's kind of the point). The public/private adversarial tension does seem contradictory, but I hope to find a middle way; surely there is a linear logical framework from which geometric social cooperation can arise (I must hope). More than ever, we require the ability to safely and rapidly engage in relationship building exercises between local and global scopes of many [[dok]]. Some of it must be automated, and some of it must be done by hand (ultimately, only we can tell our stories).

<<<
I had a conversation with my son a month ago. He was asking me why he can't have a YouTube account. It was late at night. We were lying on his bed in the dark. (I don't really want to tell you I have a son. If this were a private e-mail and I knew that I had your complete confidence, there would be no risk, no reservations. But there is risk. So I'll take the risk.) My son - he is young and he can't have a YouTube account. He was telling me about a girl in his class who had a YouTube account. I knew this girl - I had her in my class - I thought to myself that she would be good at making videos.
<<<

This is something I talk about often with my children as well.<<ref "m">> They are pre-teens now, so many of these technologies are becoming increasingly important to their daily lives. We have always followed strict online rules in our house. I feel your pain here. 

As you point out, you do not have to tell me that you have a son. Let me also point out that I don't have to believe you even have a son, but I choose to trust you. How you control your online identity is up to you, and how I interpret you is up to me. I think privacy is first and foremost a personal moral responsibility. I can support systems that enable it, but I can't actually do it for you all the way down.

You see the further problem. You can never be certain that anyone will hold your confidence. The risk is always there. The reservations of the trusting trust problem do not go away. You can always doubt, and you can only ever improve your Bayesian odds. The inductive step in trust is a leap of faith in Humanity, in The Other, sir. Building trust and real relationships is exactly why I reveal myself to you and everyone else. I want people to see how I conduct myself and my relationships across the board.

If I felt I would significantly endanger you or your son, my actions would differ. If you sent me your passwords or bank account information, I'd refuse to post them (and, of course, I don't think you should test me on it, but you are free to try, even with fake information [I will reason about why you sent that kind of information outloud]). I think we can construct examples in which I would be truly silent as well, but those are quite farfetched (or so I hope!); you will have to rely upon your own judgment of who I am in such cases. 

I think the rules of engagement with me are pretty clear. Don't say it to me unless you'd be willing to say it outloud. I can't be held accountable for balancing your security equations all the way down, and I'm not here to play "he said, she said" or cloak-and-dagger games either. I do not want the responsibility of holding unnecessary secrets (having to reason about complex private and public spheres all the way down is a cognitive load that most people clearly do not fathom, including myself), and please don't make me unless I'm morally obligated. 

If you want to speak with me anonymously, you are free to do so (in fact, you've secured a measure of anonymity with me). I do not begrudge you the opportunity to build safe identities online. I wish more people would. Your privacy with and through me is something that you are obligated to manage. Who you reveal yourself to be is up to you. With [[diamond]] balls, I really aim to be practically transparent in my practice of saying what I mean and meaning what I say directly because my integrity is at stake. 

Thus, I respect your willingness to take the risk. Thank you for sharing bits of who you are with all of us.

I thought to myself that my son would be good at making videos. I asked him how he would feel if there was a camera in the corner. There, in the dark, a camera. Broadcasting live. Could we have this conversation? Well, not even that - maybe we could have the conversation. But how would it feel?
<<<

That is a very difficult feeling. You want your son to experience the world, to build himself, and to engage. You want the world for him, and you want to shield him from it at the same time. It's not pleasant to reason about how to do this wisely, and it's not easy to teach our children about it. I feel that story; it is a heavy burden.

Just in case it needs to be said explicitly, there are some non-trivial differences in how our conversations are published on this wiki compared to a live broadcast of a camera in the corner of your room. Those differences are worth exploring.

Surveillance is not a simple issue, especially when we recognize that relationships of any magnitude may have it built into them already. Privacy will always be a matter of [[dok]]. Sometimes privacy is justified, and sometimes it isn't; the context matters.

Of course, my worry about "how it feels" is that emotions can betray us. It's very easy to confabulate. It's a realm where I aim for reason to reign as much as possible. I really do aim to live my life in such a way that an ideal objective agent watching me in my particular context could agree to it. I try to wield my privacy tools and tactics against enemies, not friends. 

Deception, even as constructed privacy, is a complex problem in moral philosophy because in its execution we use others as means, bypassing and hacking them like functional blackboxes without their knowledge. I aim to do so with every ounce of moral fiber I can muster.

Here's another example: I teach my daughter to wear makeup and care about her mere appearance not because I actually value these things (except insofar as she values the aesthetic for its own sake), but because the fastmind limbic emotional reasoning of the humans around her use those signals against her. They do not even attempt to reason about her rationally in this manner; they do not intervene on their emotions and biases, and she has a moral right (perhaps even a duty) to ensure they treat her with respect. This is justified deception in a world of irrational animal minds (let me be clear: I celebrate emotion), and I think we must be exceedingly careful in how we reason about deception. It is so easy to be conveniently mistaken to our benefit.

<<<
Maybe there is a camera in the corner. I knew that my phone was far away - in a drawer across the house. Maybe there are other phones, toys, refrigerators. Who knows!
<<<

I do not take that worry lightly. I can't resolve a lot of these problems either. I trust [[my phone|monster-14]] a lot less than my x86_64 machines and RPi's, but I've long believed we are all pwned to varying [[dok]]. I try to pick the low-hanging fruit here; it's the only practical option. My guesstimate is that you take similar courses of action.

My children read and talk about Orwell and Huxley with us because it's our duty as citizens of Humanity to understand (and appropriately react to) the consequences of these rabbitholes. 

<<<
It didn't feel like there was a camera though. It felt like it was just he and I. The conversation was ours. My side of the conversation was for him, only him. Maybe his side was for me, only me. And maybe a government camera wouldn't change that. But what if it was _my_ camera... my secret camera...

Ownership of conversations is a non-trivial issue. One thing I adore about our hyperconversation is that, in a physical sense, we both own the means of production here and shape the process together. In the material dialectic, we have a somewhat decentralized ownership of our conversation. I think we are morally obligated to engage in securing those political rights and logistics. For the practice itself as a whole, however, [[W5H]] it is communicated is still a moral matter that extends beyond (and in fact justifies) the technical tools and political rights themselves. For example, prima facie, I do not have the moral right to produce, engage, or "own" a conversation in which I verbally abuse you. Why is that?

Well, one simple way to say it is: I don't actually completely own myself.<<ref "x">> There is a way in which you (and all persons) own part of me in our conversations. I don't have a moral right to just say anything to you or anyone else in all possible contexts with no constraints. In fact, to be bound by [[The Moral Law]] just is to say Kantian Humanity owns me (in fact, what is constitutive of our dignity, the autonomy which merits respect just is that universalizable Reason itself). I take [[Applied Computational Existentialism]] seriously.

So, I agree there is a way in which your side of the conversation is "for him" and his "for you." You directly target each other's minds. But, since we are fundamentally accountable to [[The Moral Law]], your conversation is a maxim that must pass [[The Categorical Imperative]] test (which is practically computed through [[The Original Position]] heuristic).<<ref "u">> Your moral right to your words is fundamentally intertwined with and owned by Humanity (or Personhood, or Reason, or [[The Right]]) at large. Ownership is a moral fabric that extends into the cracks and infinitesimals of everything. 

So, with that caveatic framework, I agree there are tons of cases where political privacy is morally justified. I've yet to find a government which was morally justified (although, as a political animal, I hope to help build one).

We are each cameras, in a sense. I think of this wiki as an external, reifying camera of my internal camera states. I do hope to wield both wisely. I do not think I morally own either of them all the way down except insofar as I am constituted by (exist as an extension or instantiation of) [[The Moral Law]]. 

<<<
The remarkable thing about your wiki is that you have turned your camera on. In fact, your wiki is defiantly personal - I think it goes beyond a mere camera. Your history. Your conversations. Your letter to your parents. Your thoughts about people - about me. A person can turn on a camera and never say these things. You are on to something. I have no desire to talk you out of it. And I have no desire to do it myself - I wouldn't know where to begin. 
<<<

Thank you! I am trying to be radical about it. It is defiantly personal because I think most of the world is profoundly wrong. 

I'm back to the [[FO]] and [[SO]] desires question. You encourage me not to post it, but you also don't want to talk me out of it. I really appreciate your willingness to try to see, feel, and think about it both ways. This is a very hard topic (even for someone with a decade of post-secondary education in it).

Let me once again recognize that I am [[fff]]. This is simply my best current attempt at the problem. I'm sorry if I get it wrong. If I knew how to do this better, I would.

<<<
What I do want to find out is what you will do with this e-mail. Do you publish it on principle? Do you publish it because the intrigue of the conversation is valuable and needs to be exposed? Do you publish it for hits? Should we be having this conversation on our sites to get some hits? Or do you keep it to yourself - simply because it's clearly for you, only you? 

Yeah, ok, we'll start there. Take care!

In part, I aim to be so public simply because I don't trust people in private. I think very poorly of most human specimens (including many versions of myself), but I desperately hope we find a way to become good human beings. I hope to protect and enable the percentage of legitimate altruists who exist in humanity; they deserve every ounce of my effort. They are truly constituted by Reason.

I play with my cards face-up on the table. In a way, I hope it has a kind of ripple effect in spreading awareness of what it means to be ourselves, to be honest, and to maintain privacy effectively and for the right reasons in a digital world.
