title: 2019.03.13 - Afterschool Teaching: Crypto

My phone was dead up arrival again. Also, I didn't bring my backpack and charging equipment. Ouch. I did have an extra cord, and I was allowed to use Whitney's charger. I had some music. I should use my blutoof speaker; it seems to quiet them some. Who doesn't adore music, at least at that age where they getting closer to being almost fully emotionally developed?

We are forced to divide the kids by grades. I've carefully arranged the edges so that friends from across the grades still can meetup. This is bullshit.

Matt was put in charge of getting parent surveys. He didn't push hard, so now we will have to do it tomorrow. Fascinating dynamic. That will put us almost two men down. I think I will have Whitney take a handful of difficult children for me, and I will take everyone else. I hope Mitchell will be there tomorrow. That's what I did today since Matt chilled.

Delp ordered food. Good. Oh, and that's because the food inspector was here.

Whitney and 3 helpers took the 5th grade boys. I took all the rest. We did fine. Those who had homework did it and got the help they needed. Most students chose to draw. 

6CM and I talked a good bit about social conventions and morality. She wrote a couple pages of rap. We talked about syntax and Missy Elliott. I had to call her down for scratching herself with broken pen shards; like all the ghetto kids, she is marking everywhere on her arms and face (her pigtails are dyed to look like Harley Quinn but are in honor of a rapper she admires). Self-harm is something I'm looking for now. I regularly have to talk to these kids about depression and making sure they do not joke about suicide with me. Drop as many F-bombs (carefully not in front of adults) as you wish, but you may not harm yourself. We talked about what it means to be kind to our bodies and minds. I am worried. Fuck.

6AB got a book on zoology to study on my time, awesome. He and I have to wrestle sometimes, but his approval-seeking will be valuable to him with me. I need that kid to value learning more than he does (well sheeeeit, that goes for everyone, including myself).

The programmers seem to have ended their quest. =/ Fuck.

5KB, 7SR, 5AS, and 5Af were all working on the Caesar shift today. I gave an impromptu history lesson. I light up in full-blown preacher mode for my children when they strike gold. 5AS is sassy in an annoying way, but she asked whether this counted as ELA or Math. We talked about the etymology of cryptography and its nature. I should have talked about steganography, but they don't have long enough attention spans as a whole. 5KB was interested in trying something new. We talked about frequency analysis and then moved onto the Vigenere Cipher. I've encouraged them to get a book on this. It's an amazing topic. 

Inspector made it so Delp froze us into our classrooms. Gotta do what you gotta do.

7Jm and I wrestled some today. He wised up.

I took the kids to the library, and then most could goto the gym. I played chess with the 5th grade girls who tend to prefer the library (youins know what it do). I continually point out to my students they aren't allowed to have their phones according to the school's rules, so //I better not see them using their phones//. It would, ofc, be a terrible shame if any adult caught them. It is important to be well-positioned and prepared for an authority's inspection. 

Whitney talked to me about one of her homework problems about the value of self-determination in intellectually disabled children. The irony was not lost on me. I'm glad I could be of use to her.

Per [[kickscondor]]'s recommendation, I'm reading [[The Educated Mind]]. I was actually asked by a student, 5KB, about what I was reading. I sang the praises of Plato, but I didn't have enough time to bash Rousseau for her. I also brought the //Watchmen// with me (oh no, there might be a tiddy in there). We discussed its question.

I noticed a student wrote a letter of praise posted on Mitchell's office door (that jingo shit is everywhere), but it was addressed to me. There are students who like me. I must be doing something wrong. Lol.

Shot the shit with the janitors. They are ancient. Their kids are as old as I am. They talked some shit about millennials, and I talked about raising my young ones. I don't have the social capital to correct their stupidity just yet.
