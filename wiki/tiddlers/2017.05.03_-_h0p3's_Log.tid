!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

It's very early in the morning, 2:30am, as I write this.

I'm doing okay. I was sleeping okay, but k0sh3k wasn't. I came downstairs to make sure my snoring and my fan (which ultimately can never be quiet enough) wasn't keeping her up. I'm not having a hard time waking up.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

A couple things. k0sh3k is doing poorly. She can't sleep, and her energy is sapped. It feels like she is a zombie. I thought her vitamins were helping, and for a time it seemed they did. Now it seems like they are not working again. 

The kids had a bad school day, and they lied about it. When their work was checked, it was clear they had screwed around instead of actually doing their work. I was pissed. 

When it came to doing his kitchen chores, my son took forever again. It takes him two hours to do work that should really only take him 30 minutes (20 if he was pushing it). I ended up standing there directing him. He doesn't like to be bossed around and corrected (no one does). I'm not sure how better to help him see the value in just working hard.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

Right now, we are feeling incredible amounts of pressure from many directions of life. 

Financial pressures are strong. A lot is riding on me finding a decent paying job. Not having a dryer is a reminder that we can't really afford to buy another. Nothing seems to be going right for us, even though we have worked hard. 

Our children's futures seem to hang in the balance. We must rely upon them to actually do their work or this falls apart. It is much to ask of young people. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be good alternatives. The schools available to us just plain suck. As usual, we are finding it difficult to motivate them. Carrots and sticks seem useless. We take their Saturdays to complete the work they haven't during the week. This puts even more pressure on the weekends which are already generally quite busy.

k0sh3k has taken a more direct hand in helping the kids do their work. This is even more pressure on her. She sees that we are failing here. I think that's why she can't sleep. I also think she is depressed. k0sh3k doesn't have a lot of options either. For her to fall apart would bring the entire family down. Much rests upon her shoulders now. 

My loss of faith in humanity and God only adds to differentiation my wife and I feel from each other. We aren't united on these core things. 

We feel like failures as parents, spouses, and human beings.

We are out here alone. We have emergency support, but no other support, friends, or family. 

The political climate is terrible. There doesn't seem to be much hope.

Here I am, late at night, unable to sleep (my wife is unable to sleep too) because of some damn good reasons.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

What can we do that we aren't already doing? I think we have to keep trucking. Never give up!
