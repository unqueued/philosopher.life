My brother told me about the wonders of being a father of a newborn. I completely understand his frustration. He's doing a good job maintaining his sanity. He made me laugh a ton today. Claimed it was like having a partner who constantly needed elective surgeries, lol.

My bro said Matthew will be there for at least a month, but they don't know beyond that. He also said it was good practice, no matter what.

We talked about my offspring and computer for a bit. We talked about the game. =) I'm excited to play.
