Would you like an invite to IPTorrents?
1 HR AGO
It's important to me that you don't screw up on it. They might delete my account for inviting someone who doesn't play by the rules (you need to read and follow the rules). I'm happy to provide help to get you started, to understand how to use it effectively, etc.

Also, if you want, I was thinking about coming over on Saturday, if you wanted.
