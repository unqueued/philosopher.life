title: 2019.03.03 - Prompted Introspection: Strange Wedding

!! What is the strangest wedding you have ever attended?

I have been fortunate not to attend many weddings. I have little regard for them. Insofar as marriage is a meaningful covenant with life partners, I profoundly respect it. Insofar as it is a piece of paper and exists only in virtue of community recognition, I do not. There aren't many cultural events that I hold in esteem though. I say this as someone who is still trying to figure out how to [[Be A Good Husband]] 14-years into it though. 

The strangest is obviously my own! It is a symbol of a profound tentpeg in my life.
