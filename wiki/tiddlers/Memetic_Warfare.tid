title: Memetic Warfare

//Tinfoil pasta! One must wrestle with these vicious mind games, cryptocracy, and paranoic gnosticism. Hanlon is a malicious fool. Deception almost always uses people as mere means. Beware those who aim to unjustifiably manipulate your identity, defraud you of your dignity, silence or misrepresent your voice, exploit your mind, corrupt your information access, destroy appropriate threats to illegitimate political [[power]], or defeat your autonomy.//
