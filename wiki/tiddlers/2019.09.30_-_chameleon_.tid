You are the only other sneerer I've met, lol. I would like to understand how and why. I think there are crucial bridges here for us to build.

Holy shit! Thank you!

I've spent a lot of time simply exploring software. When I was a youngling, I would just spend hour after hour downloading software and trying them out. I amassed mountains of malware not on purpose, but which I eventually also collected. What boy doesn't study the blade? The other country boys would read about and collect guns (and, I agree this knowledge was crucial to my pretend soldier games with my finger-pistols and killing the various Jerry's with my brother [[JRE]] - his grenade throws were epic); skiddy hacking tools were the weapons I collected. I was a kid in a candy toolstore, awfully curious. I've not found a lot of things worth building, but I'm basically Dale Gribble when Hank Hill shows him a new tool: entranced. No doubt, I'm far closer to a caveman than a functioning person. OOooo, f i r e! =)

What is standardly described as "real" programming by my betters is something I've tinkered with from a young age. You couldn't do much on the Commodore 64 without at least imitating it. I enjoyed QBASIC and programming my calculator. As a teenager, I liked cryptography, and enjoyed reasoning about DES in BASIC. I played with assembler as well, mostly because I liked freeing software from the developer's intentions. I've fiddled with Python since 1.5. I didn't have anyone offline to teach me about computing, and nobody gave a shit enough to give me any direction or challenge me until the damage had already been done. I did land a job writing SQL, VB, and some specialized database tools for a bit at one job; I learned I was working on software meant to do evil though and I left as soon as I could. Back when I did my masters and the first year of my PhD, I worked on C, C++, and Go for fun and on the off-chance I might go back into making a living by programming. I was going into either [[my wife|k0sh3k]]'s MLIS program or the CS PhD program to work on formal verification (I have some background in logic), but then I was offered the scholarship at Tulane for philosophy (which is like winning a lottery). Can't turn that shit down, especially since it would be local (we were obligated to move to New Orleans as part of the terms of my wife's scholarship).

Like you, I prefer getting my hands dirty on my [[monster]], but I'm not skilled at it like you. Theory is fascinating, and it's crucial for reasoning about what is possible. I was disappointed by what I saw in the CS PhD program; a couple of them really knew how to use their machines (one of the university's sysadmins was pretty leet), but a shocking percentage couldn't actually get their computers to do anything except the work necessary to build and write about proofs for other computer scientists (at which point, I consider them mathematicians who aren't engaged in the empiricism necessary for calling it science and the pursuit of excellence of a practice or an art which requires probabilistic [[DOR]] all the way down). This problem showed up again for me in pipefitting where the engineer clearly understood the math, but there is something to be said for the virtue theoretic practical wisdom which can only be earned through the messier hands-on experience of putting it together yourself.

I've tried lots of languages simply because I like the idea of what they are. Like most of the games I play, I enjoy reading and {[[dream]]}ing about programming more than actually doing it. It is exceedingly rare that writing my own software from scratch is the most price-efficient method for getting the job done. Unfortunately, as I get older, I find it more tedious, and I think my time is better spent elsewhere. My offspring and I talk and work on it though. I want them to own themselves in their machines. Generally speaking, I'm this [[guy|https://xkcd.com/1172/]].

I don't begrudge your omission in this case, and you obviously can't share everything in the brief two months I've known you, lol. It seems to me you had prima facie moral right to defend yourself too. I think you've weighed your anonymity and privacy scaling wisely.

* Morally arbitrary characterstics, yet they still define us.

I think it's fair to say you have dropped many breadcrumbs and signals, and the odds were much higher to begin with. In virtue of your openness and given the unjustified persecution you experience (or likely would), I have aimed to be careful with what I say about your identity. There are users who I openly doxx, but you won't be one of them.<<ref "h">>

One of the reasons I morally owe you protection of your offline identity is because you are so validly and vulnerably [[naked]] online. I cover your [[name]] but not your [[naked]]ness.<<ref "t">> I recognize the incredible and unjustified costs you may pay for your honesty here. You do have an unjustified target painted on your head, and that is why I must silently stand between you and our enemies where I can.

You have earned my trust too! Joyously, we have reached an important point for me in which I have the chance to share my offline identity with you.<<ref "i">> I can send it digitally or physically. I prefer a secure address to a key (simply because I hate PGP), but I'll work with whatever you give me. I do not ask you to reciprocate here.

<<footnotes "h" "And, thus, your husband has the right to my silence here as well.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Though there are exceptions to that as well in this wiki for [[others]], and perhaps the same for you will be necessary some day. I would be really surprised by a need to cover and uncover though, it would have to be a hell of an emergency. Developing trust for the virtue-theoretic dispositions, affectations, or sentiments in each [[other]] is something I aim to show radical integrity in. I am a loyal friend, and I would argue, I work hard to demonstrate my loyalty to [[The Moral Law]] even with my enemies (I know, it sounds so ominous; I'm sorry, the tone cannot be changed without failing to demonstrate the truth).">>
