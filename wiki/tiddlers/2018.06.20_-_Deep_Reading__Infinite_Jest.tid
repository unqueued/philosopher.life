Orin is a piece of shit, and it's weird to see Hal highlight that so clearly.

The bricklayer's tale is random. I just don't see the point of it except what randomness in general has to tell us about the nature of telling stories to ourselves.

The heart/purse mugging is surreal, lol.

The anti-ONAN list reminds me of my wiki hardcore. I'd like to think, perhaps arrogantly, that I've spent a great deal more time attempting to organize and mindmap. DFW's book isn't meant to be an upload of a mind, but more of a mile-high view of many lives. I'm growing to think DFW would find what I'm doing interesting (assuming he were open to even looking at it).

The discussion of the information age revolution based on the Internet in the book is a prescient parody. The "fugue" of attention-divided aural illusion is on the money. DFW nailed the phenomenology of the communication.

The videophonical side of this story is interesting as a prediction.

I'm feeling that urine sample anxiety. Lol.

Pemulis' anti-entrapment method of forcing his buyers to claim over the phone that they will pay for him to commit a crime (or will hurt him if he doesn't) is interesting and funny.

James Incandenza's father's discussion with his son is profound. You hear the perfectionism in it. Jesus. I can hear myself in this character too. I feel broken like many of these characters. This may be one of the most important scenes in the book. This is a serious existential moment, and a difficult one for both of them. It is clearly influential to their lives.

Pemulis is beautifully paranoic.

I don't know DMZ as a substance, but names come and go.

Hal's narration is hilarious, but then I've decided its absurdity is actually really sad. I hope to laugh again about it.

Game is about managed fear. That sounds like he's talking about life, not just tennis. =) The game of life, of course, at least part of what Tennis is all about in this book.

Patricia Montesian's scene is rough.

Madame Psychosis, not the drug...what does this mean?

I don't understand the entire Madame Psychosis set of narratives/symbols/motifs/whatever. Psychosis, that fits this book. The details I do not understand. As I've said, I'm not qualified to read this book.

I take DFW to be a rabbitholing researcher.

DFW has a great deal to say about dependency, drugs, addiction, and essentially, our motivations and what it means. He's worried about freewill super fucking hard.
