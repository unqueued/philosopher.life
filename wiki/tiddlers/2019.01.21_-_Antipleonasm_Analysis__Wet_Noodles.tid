title: 2019.01.21 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Wet Noodles

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
When the people fear the government, there's tyranny. Then the government fears the people, there's freedom.
<<<

I appreciate the sentiment. I think legal positivism demonstrates how governments conceptually come in an extremely wide varieties, and the "freedom" from or in regards to what is not a simple one (even if we narrow it down to political autonomy as far as we can). Note, for example, how the people can basically be the government themselves.

There are fear and freedom [[gfwiwcgws]] problems which this claim sidesteps. Neither are useful in themselves; they are only instrumentally valuable to seeking [[The Good]]. One must wield freedom and fear [[irwartfrr]].

The sentiment aims to point out the value of decentralizing power. I can agree to the spirit but not the letter of the antipleonasm. I hate to be a stickler about it, but I wish to minimize ambiguity and prevent people from wet noodling and dragging their feet against a claim that could have been more perspicuous. Do not give your enemy any more space than is necessary in the dialectic.
