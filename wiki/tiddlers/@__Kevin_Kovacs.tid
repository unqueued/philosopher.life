2019.06.10 - @Kevin Kovacs: Hard to beat [[unification|https://humdrum.life/2019/06/03/where%20to%20find]].

2019.03.28 - @Kevin Kovacs: I'm sorry [[you are feeling disappointed|https://humdrum.life/2019/03/27/morning]]. You've been busy and not feeling great. I know that feel. =/ FWIW, I have been paying attention. I'm thinking alongside you, but I've not had anything to say. I'm still figuring out how to give the body-language nods in the appropriate places in the conversation train to demonstrate I'm listening even if I don't have anything to add yet. As usual, take your time responding. There's no rush.
