Happy New Year! =) -- What did you like about 2018, what are you hoping for 2019?

Happy New Year sir. 2018 was not a good year for my family. I suppose what I appreciate it most was watching my daughter grow and mature and learn. Four 2019 I guess are basic hopes would be to find a good job closer to home and to lose weight. What did you like about 2018, what are you hoping for 2019?

I am that it wasn't a good year. I didn't realize it wasn't so good. I think mine had some high highs and some low lows. We have very similar personal hopes for 2019. lol.

2018 was productive.

I hope to feel safe and useful in 2019, and I hope to make much larger strides with my children. I want to teach them how to try hard.
