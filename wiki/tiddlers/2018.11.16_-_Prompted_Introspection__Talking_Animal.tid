title: 2018.11.16 - Prompted Introspection: Talking Animal

!! What if you ran into a talking animal, what would you ask it? How would you react?

I talk to animals all the time: humans are animals. I would react as I normally do.

I feel like I communicate with other animals. Self-awareness and consciousness, of course, are hard problems. I'm not entirely sure what it means to interact with these creatures (I'm reminded of that Teleosemantics book). My cats treat me like a functional blackbox. They "talk" to me, but it's not because they have formed some theory of mind as holding significant mental states for interpreting their communications. I am just an appliance in the world to them: a tool.  I believe several species are capable of talking to some [[dok]].

I would be surprised to find [[The Other]] in a non-human animal relating to me personally; practicing [[The Golden Rule]] is not easy.

I think the corvids et al are the way I'd like to go. Though, if I had my complete druthers, it would be speaking with AI.
