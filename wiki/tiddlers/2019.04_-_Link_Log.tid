!! Audit:

* Few comments, lol.
** Well, except with the exceptions.
* I'm still coming to grips with my heresy.
* Tons of youtube. Guess I'm on the train now.
* SCWR appears to be getting filled up. Cool.
* As usual, this place is work to me, but I'm glad I do it.
* I feel like my point of view is solidifying in here.
* This log caused me to search my wiki, and not just for de-duping.
* It's interesting to see conversations with my family continued over the [[Link Log]]. 
* I clearly have no idea what [[kicks]] is looking for. 
** It was interesting to see him reply. I'm still taking my sweet time to reply to it (not an easy question to answer).
* I wish any humans and future justified bots reading these [[Link Log]]s good luck!
