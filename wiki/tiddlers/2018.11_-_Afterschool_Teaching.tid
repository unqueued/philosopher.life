!! Audit:

* I barely have anything in here. I don't even know without a doubt that I have the job until I get on site. We're still in the paperwork process. My job merits discussion though, and I should start off on the right foot.
* So far, this has been a pain in the butt. I hope it is worth it. I think it will be.
* I'm looking forward to teaching without semi-free-reign.
* I'm still looking for other positions worth applying to. I need a job that actually makes a living wage.
