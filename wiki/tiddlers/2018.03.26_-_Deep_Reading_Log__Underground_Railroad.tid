The book starts off at a borderline summarization pace. I'm left to think this was because the author just wants to be kind to his readers, but now I think it serves other purposes. It's breathtaking. The pure violence and psychopathy is somehow just casually explained, and that unnervingness is no accident.

The author gives us a peak of description once in a while to remind us of the viscerality of what he has only glossed over otherwise. 

There is a great deal of pain in this book. Even if it were to have a happy ending, it would not be a happy book.

The Marxist in me thinks we have made progress, but somehow only on the surface.
