title: 2018.11.28 - Be A Good Dad: Warrens

My daughter offered penetrating questions and insights, and it required we dig really deep. She is going to be immensely prepared for reading Plato and Aristotle (I fear she may even be bored without being [[Straussian]] enough).

We talked about what it means to speak to ourselves.

We considered the problem of other minds, qualia, what it even means to be alien, differentiationism among perspectives (antithesis of OOO), and many other things. We went down several rabbitholes.
