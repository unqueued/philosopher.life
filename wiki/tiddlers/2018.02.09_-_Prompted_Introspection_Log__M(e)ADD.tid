!! What do you think should be done to keep people who are under the influence of alcohol off the road?

First, I think we should give them safer drugs than alcohol, like cannabis. Oh, wait, before that, we should create infrastructures that make it so that we can use high-privacy self-driving electric vehicles and completely revamp our public transportation system. Oh, wait, before that we should decentralize power structures by implementing some form of practical socialism. Oh, wait, before that...

Dude, I can't answer your question without answering 10,000 other questions. 

Are you looking for my stance on philosophy of law, particularly regarding crime and punishment? I think public service is the best answer. Money doesn't affect the right people (although scaling fines are part of the deterrent I would seek); but taking their precious time (something they can't buy) would be useful. Of course, I don't think this law will be enforced evenly and fairly. Look, this question is small potatoes for me. The reason it isn't handled correctly is so systemic in nature that you are missing the forest for the trees.
