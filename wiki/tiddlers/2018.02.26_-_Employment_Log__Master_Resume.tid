title: 2018.02.26 - Employment Log: Master Resume

Okay, I need to be more diligent in actually writing out what I'm doing. This is ridiculous. I worked hard on my [[Interviewing]] page, and I didn't say a word about it in these logs. I need to get back to it.

Now I am moving onto creating a [[Master Curriculum Vitae]] that I can modularly use to create specific resumes.
