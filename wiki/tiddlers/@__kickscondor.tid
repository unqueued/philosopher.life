"[[Forget I was ever here.|https://www.kickscondor.com/marina-noseque/]]" So easy to do in fundamental disagreement, :P. Killing the thirsty and starving among us with your lite-posting. Muh addictive ~~mana~~ bread, homie, must have.

It is a delightful thought to me that we have unknowingly passed each other in many circles only to meet these many years later. I'm excited to see Dat come alive, and we hope to include it in our work in the house. I'm hesitant to say I understand your work, but I ignorantly appreciate that your cat is a generalizable hammer (I see a great deal of possibility in it). Mile-high, this is my current approach: [[Atropos]] backend pipeline with [[BDS97]], user-friendly front-ends and search with you, P2P-TWdom with muh [[cult|Cults]]. 

Also, pfft, you are cherry-picking [[gems]] in [[FTO]]. You are correct, there are many appealing folks out there, and even if they aren't most of who I find, I'm very lucky to find so many wonderful people (it breaks my 3% rule, which is beyond my predictions). I am on the hunt for beautiful people. I am forever indebted to your sunny optimism; my goggles and vodka bottles are too often foggy and half-empty.

Yes, sir. `/hug`. Without question, I know you [[love]] [[Humanity]]. Capable as you are, I know you cannot solve it all by yourself either. You also do more than your fair share. If I cannot convince you, however, there is little [[hope]] of convincing anyone else.

I'm not a [[P2P purist who denies the necessity of federalization|2018.11.10 - kickscondor: Unmoved Movers]]; it's obvious to me that we've not decentralized as far as we can and should by any stretch of the imagination. We have to overshoot the golden mean first. I also recognize we must excessively compromise beyond the ideal. 

Aside: I am excited to see what becomes of datrs. Also, worth a look: https://github.com/zerotier/lf.

Even Tox requires federation, though it's still considered P2P software. Perma-alpha software that it is, it works on 3G android. If it doesn't have to participate on the DHT beyond discovery and minimizes heartbeats to relays, it's expensive but liveable. Yes, profound decentralization of the internet is possible; one of the hard parts (and stepping stones) is virtualizing it over current centralized infrastructures until backbone routing is replaced. 

It's okay that you aren't convinced just yet. I will not give up. It is not premature optimization: decentralize until it hurts, then centralize until it works. 


; 2019.07.15 - [[@h0p3|https://www.kickscondor.com/notes/fediverse-it's-a-privilege/]] (2019.07.12):

Hey, I’m with you—I abdicated to public schools, it’s all about abdication. There are all these starvings who need someone to look back. And nobody does because forward is all that matters. Forward for them, just forward for them.

Yeah, it’s a privilege—no doubt. The IndieWeb is a meta-community, so it’ll always be that way. Its point is to strategize among the ‘capable’(?), those ‘capable’ of reshaping. It won’t work to ‘File’ > ‘Import…’ and Ctrl+A all the underpowered Android phones into the IndieWeb.

I mean, not like I know how to really solve any of this—I feel like even my best guess would summon a bunch of roving shitstorms once again—but I think if there were all these outpost IndieWebs, made of cheap static HTML and tied together with services subsidized by the gifted IndieWeb types (see brid.gy, for instance)—and discoverable by directories and link logs and the ability to mention someone to possibly rouse them (or you ignore those—or you have to have someone vouch for you to mention them), then there’s some possibility.

I’m still not sure about some purist decentralization—like, that seems awful on some 3g android, right? But like I know. The ethic of ‘find the others’ is wholesome; it’s def a starting place.

; 2019.07.12 - @kickscondor

[[It|https://www.kickscondor.com/the-indieweb-needs-to...-hide!]]'s tricky to make sure people have the correct amount of skin in the game, and owning one's digital identity has several elements of it. The Indieweb feels like federation among the privileged to me. I'm more concerned about a poor person in India with only a cheap android phone and below average digital literacy who has a moral right to participate as a political citizen with a voice he owns on a network he controls with those at the bottom. I don't think this is an issue about tourism, but I don't fully participate on the Indieweb^^tm^^. I seek a deNATed Indienet because we all have the prima facie right to be a server; it's the underlying architecture that has to change. Dat, Tox, and Hyperboria are much closer (though they fight through a great deal of centralization).

Despite the fact I can't prove it: that ain't me, btw. [[/popcorn|https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/anon-on-the-line/]], /furiously-~~masturbating~~-notetaking. I am, ofc, [[mc'luvin|I Am h0p3]] the narrative being generated between you two (or more) and thinking about what yall have to say; you have {[[my attention|Focus]]}.

; 2019.06.21 - @kickscondor

I may not have been clear enough; I did not condemn it for being "antipleonasmic" (the opposite, since that is its strength and what sucks about losing it), but I think its [[S2NR]] ratio falls off hard after reading it for a while (I feel like I've picked all the low-hanging fruit). There is only so much worthwhile gold panning to do in the shallows, and TIL is definitely that (though I do not claim antipleonasms are definitionally shallow). Reading long-winded writing is expensive, of course, and so I aim to be price-efficient in my pursuit of it. As to the probability of not just originality, but even justifiably valuable originality, there's something right about increasing our failure rates, generating wider search spaces, enabling higher variance for evolution, and constructing higher-dimensioned bodies of thought which can't be flattened down so easily (especially if we've never said it before, though even these can often be antipleonasmified and carefully reduced after iterated remodeling of the drafts). Yes, I have a difficult relationship with the TL;DR meme, but I am a wall-of-texter (you can see why I have always hated Twitter). Of course, not everything can or should be [[TLDR]]ed; like high and low level languages, I am convinced we require both directions to get the jobs done.

I'm looking into a way for you to be able to link directly to the comment without requiring unique tiddlers. I don't like that I break that function in [[@]], particularly for you. I'm still thinking about what effective atomization/molecularization of content looks like (I suspect I will never find satisfactory answers). Of course, it is the kind of problem which makes me wish I used a tool other than TW. 

; 2019.06.21 - [[@h0p3|https://www.kickscondor.com/notes/the-opposite-of-incoherent]]

Gahh, spelling. Drop the prefix. In the same way that you condemned Reddit TIL for being “antipleonasmic”, I am lately thinking of the generosity of the long-winded. As if length ≅ a greater shot at originality, perhaps just with probability on your side. (Oh and has the TL;DR acronym ever driven you nuts? I like it now, it can be self-deprecating. Originally it was just absolute antipleonasm.)

; 2019.06.20 - @kickscondor

This is off topic. I'm fascinated by the interpretation: "[''''[[antipleonasmic]]] could also be rephrased: “[[the dogged attempt to resist cliché|https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/against-blogging/]].”" It is almost the opposite of how I talk about it in [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]. I associate the concept of cliché with lacking "originality" and being overused out of context. There are significant limits to the manner in which I care about originality, but otherwise, I'm desperate for fitting clichés (perhaps we can no longer call such things clichés?). I'm not trying to resist all clichés, just the [[irwrongfrr]] ones. Insofar as [[antipleonasmic]] content is contextualized, I want it to be reduced to the essential [[gem]]. Insofar as a cliché is fitting to the context, I [[hope]] not to resist it, but instead doggedly pursue its limits. It's a mix of theory in forming the principle and applying it in context. I think it's similar to needing an interpreted contextual foundation for a circular, analytic truth (married and bachelor predicate symbols could map to perhaps any set of semantics) to have meaning. I take you to be saying the same thing.

; 2019.06.20 - @kickscondor

"[[[P]ossibly the biggest problem with social media today is how much writing is done without sufficient reading|https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/against-blogging/]]" is perhaps a variant of the Robustness Principle, and part of the [[T42T]]. Obviously, per pound of reading, I produce more ounces of writing than the average person, thus I may be in violation of a justified social contract (that is oversimplified; it is not easy to define what counts as sufficient). I don't know how we are all going to convince ourselves to read more, though it is clearly possible.

[[Lol|https://www.kickscondor.com/notes/h0p3:-ugh/]], yeah, only a detailed forensic analysis is going to be able to reverse engineer this [[hyperconversation]].<<ref "c">> Take all the time that you need. I also enjoy the indirect conversations; it's part of the context. Also, we finally have something closer to an IMing mode available to us now, yay! 🤟

; 2019.06.14 - [[@h0p3|https://www.kickscondor.com/notes/h0p3:-ugh/]]

(re: ugh) I guess this is the ‘hyper’ part of the hyperconversation. There’s conversation splattered on the ceiling at this point. (Take, for example, that I am responding to three letters here, which has tons of context around it—and I don’t know if anyone else but you and I can trace it!) It’s weird that I’m writing to you indirectly lately—but I feel like you’re okay with it for the moment. ✌️

[[Prioritizing relationships|https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/feed-reading-by-social-distance/]] also reminds me of [[The Gravity Model of Trade|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_model_of_trade]] and [[idealized criteria in selective online friendship|https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/social-instincts/201905/how-do-we-choose-our-online-friends]]. It depends on the dynamic. Picking out which voices are most [[salient]] to us and to what degree is a moral question, no doubt. It also reminds me of Moral Weighing in [[Williams|https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-bernard/]].

Most definitely [[sooper-sekrit|2019.06.06 - kickscondor: Sooper-Sekrit]]. Set back to unlisted just for you! The original posting was one of my uncountable silly mistakes. We thought about setting up a 2FA and portknocked one-time ephemeral stream off our blackops hidden Tor site proxying to a heavily guarded i2p node running in SEAsia, but we were convinced you maintain a continuous screen cap and felt this was way dumber. I knew you would appreciate it. 11 and 13 now. I hope we meet someday too. =)

I manually swapped dat keys in hypercore to [[join the swarm|https://www.kickscondor.com/dat-2019]]. It works fine from Beaker.
