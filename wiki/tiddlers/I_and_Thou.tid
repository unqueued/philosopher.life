Two modes of existence:

* The attitude of the "I" towards an "It", towards an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience.
* The attitude of the "I" towards "Thou", in a relationship in which the other is not separated by discrete bounds.

I suggest "Thou" is concerned with empathy. That we take up "The Other's" goals, point of view, feelings, inferences, etc. as our own to a sufficient extent that they become extensions of our identities (or at least embedded as virtual experience machines in our minds). Insofar as we take others to be ends in themselves, to be our ends in binding ourselves to the CI, it is clear that we have entered an "I" towards "Thou" attitude.

I'm not convinced mutual reciprocity is necessary to the concept. Clearly, agent A can phenomenologically understand B through the I-Thou attitude, but not the other way around. Of course, it is a good thing when they both do, generally speaking. 

The unity of being and ultimate Thou of God is ridiculous. I think this person is moved by the CI, but does not clearly understand the implications for phenomenology. I can see Buber tells a potent theological narrative, but it lacks the art of philosophy too much. His work is reducible to more effective [[Diamond]].

Well, of course. There is the world with the CI overlay and without. I'd also like to add there is obviously an "I" toward "Thou" where "Thou" targets "I". That is to say, you can practice the golden rule with yourself, empathize with yourself and future identity, etc. I am very pleased to see this argument from Buber, even though I disagree about where it ends up.

Unfortunately, I think empathizing with people is also more complicated than Buber has implied (or he is wrong in some fundamental ways). Essentially, I think I can empathize with someone in a way that requires "I" toward "It." I have to enter a present-at-hand mode about your existence to engage in philosophy and science about who you are and how I can empathize with you more effectively. Solving empathy problematics is highly empathic, and no, we cannot forever live in the ready-to-hand "I" towards "Thou" mode. 

NM, I am wrong. This is exactly why Buber stopped being a mystic. The argument just isn't articulated well enough. It has the classic problem that so many phenomenologists have in their irrational hatred of the present-at-hand mode. We must objectify humans if we are to be honest, but we must always attach the meaning of dignity as a property to their objects, and we must be careful in a number of other ways. One must build a kind of scaffold around the laboratory to make sure science is done ethically.
