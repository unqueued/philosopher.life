title: 2017.06.20 - Carpe Diem Log

* I woke up and went back to sleep. I was sleepy. Meh.
** No workout, no time. I needed to push out bricks (sloppy and quick) before work. I was like lightning!
* Work was fun, and I'm a bit sore. It was gratifying.
** Get 'dem workaholic drugs goin, yo! 
*** I needs me dat workahol.
* I spoke with the family over lunch. I was pleased to see my kids were on task.
* MB called me today, but I was in the shop.
** We agreed to play phone tag. 
* I made a tool today! It was very cool. I'm super pleased with my (shitty) tool.
** It will be useful. Found out it costs $85 to buy one.
* I called my brother JRE twice. 
** They were brief discussions, but good ones. I'm always happy to talk to him.
** I hope there is a chance he might visit in a couple weeks. 
*** I'd love to show him the shop.
* When I got home, I found my kids were on track. Praise Jeebus!
** I encouraged them, and they kept going. Yay!
* I played a couple games of league, surfed, and did some writing.
* I have made sexual congress with a woman.
** Inform the men!
* We prepped to go swimming, got the food ready, grilled out while the kids swam, and had a great dinner.
** It was wonderful. I feel like I am connecting a lot more with my kids. 
** We talked about the DND game we'll play when our cousins come to visit.
* I got a call from JOP. She was sad. I cheered her up.
* My children did their chores, and we may stay up to watch something.
