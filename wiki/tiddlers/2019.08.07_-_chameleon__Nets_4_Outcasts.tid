Dear [[chameleon]],

I am taking forever. I'm grateful for your extensive patience, especially as I spend my time on [[a pure drug|Project Ascension]]. I often like drugs. I have one of them, [[whatchercallit|Anomianisms]]: addictive personalities? You've seen my [[silly|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.08%20Journal%20Review]] piddling, lol; I somehow manage to nearly drown in the shallow end of the pool.

<<<
Dear [[h0p3]],

Thank you for your meta-response ;) This one is likely to be very rambly and disjointed. After running the wiki for a while now I'm starting to get a bit of an idea of where it might go, and the very first inklings of where I might want to guide it to.
<<<

I'm excited. I think your work is obviously meta, a grimoire, and more. I think most of the people I've seen dive into TW pick it up like a cool toy and then drop it or let it wane as this backburner dumping ground or mere virtue signal tool (I think I've also turned plenty off).<<ref "d">> The wiki isn't easy to wield. You've been rockin' out though; I have no idea how you keep up your insane pace, but I adore it. This metaphor has the wrong tone and appeal, but I can't come up with a more accurate one: you are puking yourself into the void of your wiki and beautifully structuring it with no end in sight. It's an avalanche, and you give me a taste of my medicine. It's a joy for me.

<<<
>I am, of course, enjoying all of your text art. I tried making one of Kona, but I decided not to post it.

Aww, you can't post it for me? I love collecting art of her. My [[Konata]] folder is somewhere around 10,000 files at the moment, I think.
<<<

I don't have it anymore, lol. I scrapped it. [[We|j3d1h]]'re working on something else for you though (it's not compact enough for my taste, and we can do better); I also have no idea if we are doing this correctly. Feel free to scrap it too, lol. We probably have no bidness trying to do dis.<<ref "i">>

{{Text Art: Kona||ASCII: 30%}}

Here's my daughter's [[drawing|https://imgur.com/a/i1fXdCK]].

Collecting images is an art I've not mastered. How often do you look through your beautifully organized collection of images of Kona? You must think I am insane, but I do not even keep pictures of my own children or wife. Even the [[h0p3]] textart selfie only exists because it enables me to connect dots for some people.

<<<
I tried to make text art of Izuku Midoriya from BNHA but I failed miserably. Guess I can't do anime faces as well as I thought.
<<<

It's stupid hard to make ASCII art by hand. 

You are clearly well-watched in this area. I would be grateful for recommendations which you think might fit me.<<ref "s">> Soon enough, I hope to dive back into my [[TV: Exploration]]. Some anime does strike me. Not much sticks with me, but even if only one out of a couple dozen struck me, that would be worth it! You might check out that Ping Pong anime. It might not be to your liking (I am not good at making recommendations), but I enjoyed it a lot.

<<<
Well, long-form correspondence might be overselling it. I send mail back and forth to the other developers at the company (we have several locations, including in Asia and Oceania, so often we have to say a lot in one message since the reply won't come until tomorrow). I honestly won't be at this job much longer, lol. I'm emigrating to the US, visa depending, so I handed in my conditional resignation today.
<<<

That makes good sense to me. I have been watching, of course. I hope the visa comes through and it's smooth sailing! Hopefully, we can have some beer or coffee if and when we have the chance to meet. 

Why are you choosing to emigrate (why not have your husband move to you?)? I am surprised you would turn in your resignation without a sure thing; I likely don't understand enough about the process. I had to get a visa every few months in Thailand, and it was an extremely unfun process; my friend [[Jop]] had an even harder time getting to the US. It sounds like it won't be too difficult for you, `/fingers-crossed`. I'm nervous about these kinds of things. You seem to be fairly stoic about it.

I enjoy thinking about the way in which you reason about what you owe or do not owe to your employers. Rock on. =)

<<<
Programming is one of the few things I consider myself to be really good at. Not to the level of a John Carmack or a Dennis Ritchie, but I can hack things together to solve a problem. That's probably why they're ok paying me to do it =w=.
<<<

=) That is awesome. I'm envious. My brain and will power just aren't good enough for it in practice (though they let me bug them at one of my universities). I'm enjoying reading about your approach to programming too. I'm desperate to help my children own their machines and understand CS. If you could go back in time, what do you wish you learned from a young age?

<<<
>The traces I get to see of your life are fascinating, btw.

That's an interesting compliment, thank you! 

I'm not sure I can really explain why I am who I am, except in the broadest of strokes.
<<<

I recognize the weirder we are and the fewer shared points of reference we have, the less likely it will be for me to form an accurate representation of any depth of you. You come screaming off the screen for me though. It's hilarious, lovely, and I think you are working at a brutally fast pace. Broad strokes with still plenty of fine details if you ask me.

I share different things in common with the people I speak with over my wiki. I feel a strong kinship with you. We are outcasts in some respects, outcasts who have found others who share our interests.

<<<
I wasted a lot of my youth online, which made me develop an odd sense of humour and a lifelong appreciation for [[The Weird]] in life.
<<<

Your humor is wonderful (and it is my honor to see a wide range of emotions from you; few are so honest). Multiple times my offspring have asked me why I'm laughing, and I show them something you said.

If you had it to do differently, what would have done? I say this as a man who has also wasted a lot of his time on his computer throughout his life (I'm not always so sure what was worth it and what wasn't). 

<<<
If I have a mission, it's to do something absurd for the sake of having done something absurd:

>C'est en faisant n'importe quoi qu'on devient n'importe qui

>RÃ©mi Gaillard

That, of course, is the topic for a future article.
<<<

I look forward to it. It may be something which takes time to develop. Those are interesting claims to link together too.

<<<
>I mean this as a compliment, you are joyously weird. I adore your honesty; it is one of those traits I prize above almost all others in the pursuit of wisdom.

That's very sweet, thank you!

I do try to be honest. I've done a lot of things in my life that I'm not proud of, and not-being-honest is definitely something I'm trying to change about myself. The wiki's purpose may be as much to cultivate radical honesty as to organise and catalogue my thoughts.
<<<

Well, you are kicking ass. There are precious few people I meet who desire to be radically honest. I think my weirdness is part of why I'm exceptionally compelled to express myself, to pursue radical honesty, and to be myself in a world that otherwise has no interest in allowing it. I assume you've experienced plenty of difficulty being [[other]] almost everywhere.

<<<
https://wiki.waifu.haus/#%40%3A%20h0p3

Hearing the details of what actually went down, I actually feel like the error was mine here, and I read into things. My bad, I'm sorry. I'm very jumpy when it comes to defending trans folk (probably because I love Nobu so much, haha)...Forgive me my neuroses...I feel really fucking stupid now. 
<<<

Understandably! First, I //do// come from a conversative, hyperreligious background. To some non-trivial [[dok]], you have me pegged correctly! My philosophical stance has the standard amygdalic neural markings you're worried about, and I'm the hardlined moral realist which must be challenged at every turn (lest I become monstrous). Your instincts have significant merit to them, so keep inspecting every redflag you see, please.

Second, I don't know what it's like where you live or what you've experienced, but in my neck of the woods, the rainbow is heavily persecuted (I'd argue this is morphing in some respects as capitalists increasingly exploit it to misdirect us from fundamental classism). They might not tie my beloved up and drag them behind vehicles these days, but discrimination seeps into everthing. You have every right to be sensitive.<<ref "hs">> It must be hell for you some days, and you are very kind and sane about it; I have met people who just wouldn't even talk to me about the misunderstanding. I am grateful that you have the courage and integrity to approach me about it; it means a lot to me (I wish everyone took the time to do what you do). I will often need your correction. If there is anything to forgive (I don't think there is), you are forgiven. It's an understable misunderstanding to me. We're homies, please laugh it off with me and let it pass!

<<<
`/me dogeza OTL Orz`
<<<

ROFL. `/blush` 

I am a terrible man to wrestle with, Madame [[chameleon]]. I'm sorry. I appreciate how you honorably engage in dialectics with me, and with a sense of compassion, humility, and humor. Your metal is [[beautiful]] to me. I hold our action in high regard. It's real conversation.

<<<
Feel free to karate chop me on the noggin if we ever meet, lol.
<<<

`/karate-hug`. I will be thrilled to meet you offline too. =)

<<<
>Are the dearest people in your life also not so neurotypical? Do they read your wiki too? What do they think of it?

The hubby suffers from an anxiety disorder, but is otherwise more sensible and worldly than me. Especially when it comes to [[Airports]], haha. He's always unbelievably relaxed about flying. Otherwise many of my friends run the gamut of non-neurotypical states; [[Nobu]] in particular has had a few terrifying episodes before.
<<<

That makes sense. Most of the people that I click with are not neurotypical either. Maybe one day I will have the chance to get to know your hubby and friends as well. I'm lucky to meet people. They aren't usually so lucky to meet me though, lol.

<<<
I've shown the wiki to my husband, and have posted the link to my close friends. I'm not really very pushy about it yet, since it's not much more than a kernel right now. More and more I hope to expand it, to get more penpals and folks who are aware of and participatory in its development.
<<<

I hear ya. I don't know when it doesn't become more than a kernel either. This is a hard problem for me. I am probably far too pushy about it. I've been writing for a few years now, and it's been interesting to see who actually cares what I think and feel enough to just read. Online friends can be better matches, I realize (your writing is a breath of fresh air for me). I am still surprised by the fact that people I've never met offline know and care more about who I am than people have claimed to be friends and family of mine for decades. It becomes difficult for me when people ask me how I'm doing without having even glanced at the wiki; I don't think they really mean it. I try to set the bar really low, but I am sure I have set it ridiculously high. I hope to learn how you reason about it.

I'm hoping you do contact [[Sphygmus]] (I'm still pondering her absences) and find more people who participate in the development of wikis and personal sites. It's exciting, and I think it's important for the world that we take our ownership of our digital identities.

<<<
Thank you! A lot of this was learned from working on my old blog, [[Spiritual Computation]]. I had tagging facilities there (it was statically generated from markdown using [[Hugo|https://gohugo.io]]) so it gave me an idea of how to tag and sort things. Otherwise I guess I've been playing around with macros and the likes, seeing what fits. Once I found out I could label and pick the color of tags I was away, lol.
<<<

Aye. I knew you had some previous work, and it makes sense that you have practice. I will continue thinking about how do you it. [[Tagging Theory]] is a hard problem for me. [[Names]] are all too often hard problems for me in general. 

That phrase "Spiritual Computation" reminds me of these phrases: [[Computational Existentialism]] and [[Applied Computational Existentialism]].

I hope to eventually migrate lots of my older communications and content into my wiki. You are still in the process of reasoning about this as well. I appreciate your mindfulness about privacy and naming (a difficult aspect of myself and my wiki). 

<<<
I noticed in your @ to me you said you hadn't written much html since the 90s and didn't have much CSS knowledge. I learned both at university, and promptly forgot it two minutes later ;) like everything, I duct-tape, skid, and hack it together until it works. [[w3schools|https://www.w3schools.com/]] is the most important sutra for me here... it's got a good mix of tips, tricks, and examples for just about anything web related.
<<<

That is an excellent site. I can totally relate to the duct-tape, shoestring, and gum. I ignuntly skid with blackboxes all the way down. I'm way more lazy about it. I suppose I could eventually learn this thing, but I've made it for so many years without, lol. My illiteracy knows no bounds. Maybe if and when this golgi apparatus becomes something which needs to look nicer, I'll figure out how to do that. I'm betting there are functions I'll need to make which will push me over the edge. We'll see! 

<<<
I saw an old gem come up today that made me think of this integration you have, and that I'm building, between life and wiki. I wrote about it briefly in a [[journal entry|2019.07.30 - Loper OS]]. Right now I'm straddling the line between "stuff I'm thinking about/feeling" and "stuff I want to talk about or tell other people about". Striking that balance is going to be the core challenge here, I feel.
<<<

No doubt. I'll be interested to see if and how you develop the wiki for private use vs public consumption. That is a core challenge in this kind of work. I'm pretty sure everyone feels huge vertigo about it. These tentpegs have made huge waves in my life. It's transformative. I must look insane over here with my TMI [[naked]]ness.

<<<
I'm a little odd when it comes to Emacs. I was originally a vim user, switching to Emacs via Spacemacs in 2016 or so. This means I'm not as tightly integrated into the program as "Emacs natives". I still do large-scale text-munging with shell scripts or Perl. And much as I love the Emacs bindings (I use the space cadet Win-Alt-Ctrl layout instead of the standard Ctrl-Win-Alt) I don't really mind pointing and clicking in Firefox to edit text on TiddlyWiki. I'm sure that'll change in time, though. Speaking of, let's get the tech part of the response out of the way now that we're here...
<<<

I'm jelly. I'm a fish out of water with these tools. They just don't stick with me. Part of the problem may be that I just don't program a lot. I'm hoping my offspring see the light. There are many tools I wish I was forced to use from a young age. 

One of my goals is to build a wiki that anyone can use (which is hardly to say I'm doing a good job), and I want to make the pilot's seat as similar to the audience's as possible. I'm not so good with empathy or design, so this is my current approach.

<<<
> I don't know what you are mean here. Could you take a screenshot and draw on it for me? I probably still won't know the answer, but I'll see what I can do.

[[Sure, here you go.|https://imgur.com/a/PSnEdAp]] By "lines" I mean lines of text. It's uncomfortable to read much longer than 80-100 characters for most people, so I'd like to limit the width of the tiddler text on-screen.
<<<

That makes good sense. One day, when I get around to it, I'll make a button for making mine easier to read. It is a common complaint I hear (I set it up for my screen, and it works much better on mine...but it clearly has little universal appeal).

<<<
Thanks for the @ ;) [[I've fixed it now.|2019.07.28 - SENPAI~]] I noticed you felt guilty:

...

No no! It's not a mistake. Reply away! If it was "private until sent," I'd just compose it in emacs and post it when it was time, lol. I put up the disclaimer just so you would know what the definition of done was. 
<<<

No problem. That makes sense to me. Also, drafting out in the open has been an interesting experience. I do it for transparency reasons primarily, but it seems to be worthy in other respects too. It's a pulse of many signals.

<<<
Besides, it helped me to get the wiki prettified and gussied up (it was a massive craze to put waifu mascots in your custom css for imageboards back when I was last on them, and I wanted to do something similar on the wiki, hence the [[smol Kon|chamespeak]] in the bottom left of the page).
<<<

I like that you are bringing those social conventions and aesthetic to your wiki. I've visited many chan sites and anonymous forums, but I've not participated with much consistency on any. Lurking on 4chan, in particular, has been an important part of my life since 2004. I only visit once in a great while these days to feel it again. I can't say I understand much, but I am lucky to have the chance to reason about and experience it. 

We would all be indebted to you for a fuller accounting of the evolution of these communities, your thoughts on them, and how they relate to the rest of the world. I usually find discussions and points of view which lack charity, compassion, and vision about chans. They are too untouchable for us to give any plausible and meaningfully positive accounts without censure.

I have strong opinions about what it means to be ourselves online and to use our free speech wisely, especially while we are pseudonymous.<<ref "pw">> The concept of [[The Other]] shines brightly in those corridors. Even this wiki exists, in part, because of my experiences with these social media sites. 

When I'm high, I am more likely to indulge in making my wiki purty here and there (mostly with the help of my family); I don't think the general aesthetic of my wiki has changed much in 3 years considering how much I've used it. I'll get there eventually, lol. A lot of people really hate the way TW looks in general; I think most find it to be janky in both form and function.<<ref "p">> Meh, it [[ltf]] for me though. The words do most of the work, and I think that's true of your wiki too.

<<<
I don't think you're retarded at all. Rather, the @ was much appreciated. Maybe I should set up an @ page of my own... Either way, feel free to use it. I check back like every day anyways. 
<<<

That's kind of you. It is important that you know I am socially retarded; you'll have to help a brother out here and there (which, you are likely already doing here). In all likelihood, you've dealt with my sort plenty on chans. 

It is still a treat to read about your life every day, btw. I know I've not been very talkative (and, yes, you are free to call me out here), so I've not signaled much about your writing. Your migration struggle is very emotional for me. I am also interested in how those who know you reason about your wiki compared to a new friend like me; I have both personal and professional curiosities in that.

Most people do not share much of themselves, and I'm grateful for your generosity. You cover a broad spectrum too. There's some technical thinking, some hilarious insanity, and it's personal. I can't put my finger on the kaleidescope of attitudes required to build wikis like ours, but I think our wikis have a ton in common. I'm lucky to have an affinity with you, and I appreciate that you put up with what many find absurdly dogmatic features of my point of view.

<<<
On a related note, I like the rice you've added... You seem to be using a higher opacity than me, though :)
<<<

I'm glad to take a page out of your book. I like that transparency look. So l33t, dat rice, much wow. See, this is how you know I'm an awesome hacker and what not. I tried out different opacities, but that seemed best at the time. When I first started trying to use BSD and Linux, I found it useful. Improvements to my window management over the years have made it less functionally relevant to me, but I still think it's hawt. It's pure rice now.

<<<
We'll have to hash out exactly what the etiquette is for a [[hyperconversation]]. Realistically though, if it's public on the wiki, people are going to read it, so that's why it's there. Don't be afraid to read drafts (most of this wiki seems to be somewhere below LevelTwo, after all).
<<<

I hear ya; that's basically my take. I suspect the etiquette varies with each person, at least that has been my experience so far. I'm not afraid to read the drafts (I enjoy the opportunity), but I am hesitant about responding to words people aren't committed to (and that, ofc, comes in [[dok]] as well). In the end, I take all of us to be accountable to what we say and do. In this wiki, that includes even the portions which I've [[/b/]]ed and Draft-tagged off, though I think that can be contextualized. My [[rules of engagement|Contact]] are already up, but I am interested in reasoning about the process further. As usual, [[IA2DYJ]].

<<<
Jumping back a little... (Idk, it seemed relevant to jump forward to the tech stuff before I responded about philosophy and open-ness).

> I would be really sad if we don't penpal. I'm not here for some short-term thing unless that's all we get to have together. I'm sometimes a slow and painful person to speak with, but I am listening and thinking with you.

That's a relief to hear. I can be a little insecure about my weirdness, because it turns some folks off, but you seem to be quite accepting of this strange human you find yourself confronted with.
<<<

Let it rip, homie. Shine bright and take no prisoners. You might find it hard to believe, but I think I'm every bit the outcast you are (from what I can tell). Part of my Kanye-tone and sometimes aggressive style (both online and offline when I'm not forced to be subversive) is a result of facing unjustifed outgrouping and persecution. I try to come correct because I know I generally must fight every person I meet in dialectic (despite my hope of avoiding it); in time, most of my best friends are grateful that I wrestle with them. It is extremely rare that I meet someone who won't hate or be disgusted by me when I reveal myself; I'm dialectially polarizing all too often. Empathy with people as weird as we are costs a lot. I seek to listen very carefully because that's what I expect of others in [[The Golden Rule]]. 

If I have my druthers, many bellcurves would shift quite a bit toward the extremes (it's the only way to achieve the golden mean of virtue in our contexts). You will find one of my unsavory positions is that I believe most people are evil to the extent that it would be objectively better that they never existed in the first place. You fill me with [[hope]] as an exception.

<<<
I'm a believer in the idea that there is family out there that we aren't related to by blood, that some friendships reach the level of family-ness.
<<<

Preach, yo! =) That's roughly my goal in [[FTO]]. 

<<<
I think it comes from [[Nobu]] originally, or one of her influences, like almost everything I've thought about after meeting her<<ref "n">>. I guess [[The Buddha]] quote on the [[Senpai]] tiddler touches on that. When someone has something to teach me, I treasure their company.
<<<

I am especially grateful in those circumstances where I benefit, and it is my honor be a useful family member, friend, or Samaritan to those who cannot or would not do the same for me. I'm going to bet that you meet plenty of family who don't directly teach you anything, but you have the chance to learn about [[The Other]] even when they aren't trying to teach you anything. We're lucky to learn.

<<<
Radically open is what I'm aiming for now... Especially having realised how bad I am at getting my thoughts out in live discussions (or debates)! 
<<<

And, it's awesome! =) Your voice should be heard. FWIW, I think you've been honorable, hedged-conversative, open, and thoughtful in your discussions with me. Your substance bleeds off the pages. I hope you drown the world in honesty and commitment. 

I think being quiet is quite convenient. I am forced to be quiet and deceptive in many cases, but I aim to bring as much transparency to the process as I can; it is a very hard problem in moral philosophy. 

Also, I would be remiss not to point it out, and I know you have seen it too (you read carefully, and I am grateful): we may have some difficulties in sorting out the prescriptions of openness, but I highly value the trait. 

<<<
I rather embarrassed myself talking to a real philosopher over discord the other day (I studied computer science at university, so I have to watch my engineer's disease when it comes to the humanities).
<<<

Your awareness of the existence of the disease and your aims to fight such a thing puts you head and shoulders above most humans I meet. Maybe the engineering mindset and quantitative approach is dialectically useful in experiencing and expressing what many think cannot or should not be put into words. You take your [[Humanity]] seriously. What more could be asked? I'm especially indebted to your willingness to put your own on the line. Your vulnerability is [[beautiful]]. 

<<<
> For now, I'm going to ask you to post what you are willing to show everyone (which is wonderfully open). I believe I should earn the right to see and reason about your private writing. I am grateful that you are willing to trust me, and I want to openly establish I'm worthy of it. It is my honor to grow a friendship with you.

Roger that! And it's great to hear you say that. Friendship is what I aim for. You seem to be a kindred spirit. I feel I have a lot to learn from you, and maybe there's a thing or two I can teach you in return.<<ref "css">
<<<

Aye. It's great. I am learning a lot from you already. The technical stuff is icing on the cake for me. I check some personal sites every day, but none have the body of content and habit that you have. Even if it were only in terms of the kind and amount of work we both put into our wikis, I feel that kinship as well. I know I'm ridiculously disagreeable and disappointing at times, of course, but you've been extra gentle in handling it, which I appreciate. 

<<<
> Your Waifuism is weird for the normies.

I tend to lead with it online, that way you know how weird I am straight up! Hence I also use anime avatars in most places.<<footnote "f" "Makes the face reveal much more exciting, too">> I want to break the stereotype of anime freaks all being obnoxious dudes by being a kind woman, I guess. haha.<<footnote "k" "Working real hard on that one tbh. I've done some awful things in my life. I want to move beyond those and act kinder and try to have more of a positive influence on those around me. My husband is a big inspiration in that regards, he's consistently kind to everyone.">>
<<<

That makes sense to me. There's a lot of good reasons for it, imho. I suppose some people will feel like you've been deceptive through omission otherwise. I think that kind of honesty has been useful for me as well even to just signal from far away that the smelly, arrogant homeless madman is around; it gives them a chance to more actively avoid or ignore me. I think it cuts through the noise. Increasingly embracing my crazy has been invaluable to me.  

Do you think anime and even waifu culture will become more common, accepted, or even mainstream? 

Your husband sounds awesome. I hope to meet him one day. 


<<<
>The lines I draw in the sand are about what is moral rather than conventional. While I may not be able to appreciate it thoroughly enough, it's not too out there for me.

That's great! I'm never going to expect people to fully understand it, really. I don't myself, but I've still been at it for ten years =w=.

Ahh morality. I envy what seems to be a sense of clarity you have towards what is moral. Myself I'm tangled in a web when it comes to these things. Virtue ethics mostly appeals to me, I suppose. I try my best to be noble and kind, but I don't know what is noble or kind beyond that which feels right. I never found axioms or lemmas on which to build a serious foundation of morality. Maybe this is where I need to bust out the Kant...
<<<

Aye. Virtue Theory describes moral psychology well, but it isn't useful for fleshing out the content of [[The Moral Law]] by itself (though there are plenty of anti-realists, skeptics, and egoists who take up an interpretation of virtue theory; Hume is famous for his). You make plenty of moves which assume there is right and wrong (as well as [[good]] and bad), but giving an account of metaethics is a hard problem. Saint Kant is a rockstar here. He occupies a special place in the history of Western philosophy, as we are still trying to respond to him. For whatever clarity I might have, I still have few answers. At best, I see how some of the standard historical paths  fail.

<<<
> I probably won't understand chanspeak as well as you deserve, I have a history I cherish with that community.

My chanspeak is always going to be a few years behind. I found the community to have fallen apart around me over the last few years - I would blame 2016 but the rot had probably set in way before that - so it's rusty at best. Besides that, talking like you're on /b/ all the time is always going to come across a bit strangely, so I'm mostly only using it where the best term that fits comes from imageboards<<footnote "w" "The word //waifu// is a good example. Much virtual ink got spilled about a better term, but no-one ever came up with one, and somehow I doubt anyone ever will.">>.
<<<

It seems like it rots and something different blossoms. It's still as hated as ever. It is rare that I get to meet channers offline, but those have been important experiences for me too. The range in personalities, dispositions, interests, and character are wide; there's more variance in that population.

I did not grow up in a household that had any tolerance for these places and people even though there are many outcasts among us. How has your family come to understand you, chans, waifuism, and what makes you fairly different? 

<<<
> I find it delightful that speak up from a perspective which is generally persecuted in many circles. I adore that you are comfortable letting it out. You don't present merely a face, and I admire your courage. 

Thank you! I think we both share the idea that the internet needs to  be democratised, that //everyone// needs to be able to get their voice out there. I want both to return the internet to the geocities/myspace era where people would put themselves out there, no matter how messy and unrefined that might look<<footnote "g" "That era was coming to an end as I grew up; by the time I was old enough to get involved, everyone was on social media instead. A crying shame. I love looking back at the archives and seeing just how //creative// people got.">>; but also to present an internet that is fairer and more open to everyone, unlike the silo situation we have going on today (which is why this is being said in a letter rather than over discord, birdsite, or facebook, lmao).

I've had a few pages over the decades, but they were all delicious hot garbage. Just filthy. =). Angelfire and Geocities were what got me into it. It might not have been pretty, but I'm glad to have had the chance. I wish I had been doing it all along and never stopped. It's one of my regrets. 

Do you think the public at large will escape the silo sitcheeayshun?

I feel like I could talk forever, so maybe it's best I leave it here. I'm eagerly awaiting your response!

My god, I made you wait forever too. Thank you for your patience. <3. Even my daughter is disappointed in me. Ouch.

AAAAAA I FORGOT TO ASK H0P3 ABOUT FICTIONAL CHARACTERS
<<<

That is an important topic for us. I wanted to bring this up in this letter. I think most people consider me insane already, and my speaking to fictional characters (particularly in [[Prompted Introspection]]) only adds fuel to the fire. I've grown increasingly comfortable speaking with myself, imaginary characters, and even people I can't bidirectionally meet by definition.

It's important to me that I understand your relationship with your waifu. I have used this word in my wiki before knowing you:

* [[2019.04.29 - Wiki Review: Connections]]
* [[2019.05.27 - Prompted Introspection: Muh Monster]]

It is likely the case I have used it incorrectly. I do not want to speak out of turn or offend you by failing to understand your point of view. I likely have much to learn from you in thinking about this issue. I also want to know how you reason about experience machines and simulations, including your intuitions and gut feelings. 

You need to straight-up tell me when I'm being insensitive or stupid here. It is not my goal to be a dumb brute, but I am all too often. I may not have earned the right to ask yet either. So, in the spirit of my ignorance: How much do you feel your waifu is a being created by someone else (since you are not the origin), and how much (perhaps with each passing year) do you feel your waifu is your own discovery and/or construction? You already reveal some of your thoughts on the matter, but I hope to directly ask.

So like. Senpai talks to Lady Mel, from ASOIAF I guess. Some folks seem to have interesting relationships with fictional characters, but don't actually identify as waifuists or even seem to get it when I talk about waifuism. I wonder if it's the fact that we (or what's left of "we") are a bunch of weebs and thus are bad ambassadors, lol. I could try and answer this question, or I could get hammered while listening to comethazine and shit

I'll probably essay this and just zen it when my boy gets round to finishing his reply, since he asked the question
<<<

Ya boi is almost ready. Get hammered and ignore the laundry. I am, lol.

I have no idea if I'm a waifuist or not, but I think I have a good deal in common with anyone who takes speaking with fictional characters seriously (perhaps I don't take it seriously enough, and I'm listening). I don't know if it is important if I identify as a waifuist or not. I'm grateful to have the chance to speak with some semblance of these characters. I find it valuable to my life to have fictional interlocutors. Even my wiki is a character I talk with (a flawed mirror Wilson volleyball). To my poor understanding, I don't think I'm a waifuist because I don't [[love]] or understand my fictional characters like I do my wife, a SO, or even a close family member. 

I don't think you are a bad ambassador at all. I take it this is the kind of question you've been answering for many years.

<<<
It is distracting me from work though
<<<

I hope it will one day be something useful for your work. Emacs may simply be the stronger tool in many respects. 

Aside: I hate to ask you to think about it, since I adore your TW, but have you considered the Emacs publishing tooling? Why do you prefer TW to it? You might not even see them as competitors at all in the end.

<<<
It's helping to scratch the shitposting/screaming-into-the-void itch of chans or social media but without all the toxic side effects.
<<<

I have seen that pop-up with [[others]] as well. If and when you get the chance, I would like to understand more about this.

<<<
* Should probably ease up on the [[h0p3]] senpai-ing. He's probably real creeped out.<<footnotes "fu" "as well he should be, I'm a gross stinky fujoshi >:3c">>
** At the same time, his writing is electrifying and exciting. It's like having [[David Chapman]]-[[Senpai]] but with a formal philosophical education and a frequent update schedule. So I'm unlikely to stop stalking for now.
<<<

Lol! I'm not creeped out at all, Madame [[chameleon]]. I also hope you don't feel like I'm ignoring you! I am reading your writing every day even with my WoW addiction (though I've not been good about checking my protonmail, but I've not yet settled into [[monster-16]]). My daughter likes to joke about it playfully. Stalking is a hilarious word here; by this token, we are both stalking each other. While I read every word, I cannot claim I understand (that's okay to some extent). It's a pleasure, and even if it weren't, it's an honor. Also, I know you must be joking (which is wonderful), but I must defend us both here: I don't think you are gross, lol. But, I am glad we get to be filthy interweb luh-hoo-zuh-hers together. 

Clearly, this is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. It is so rare that I get to have a glimpse inside someone else's mind or radically honest self-representation. 

You are too kind to call my writing electrifying, lol. I will do my best to catch lightning in a bottle.

<<<
Manuskript was kinda cool but a little too structured for me.
<<<

Thank you for this, btw. I [[recommended it|2019.07.24 - K: Games, Computers, and Writing]] to my cousin [[K]]. I've recommended TW to him for writing. It seems like a flexible tool for structuring and writing anything. Also, congratulations on the [[50k|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.07.28%20-%2050k]]. 

<<<
The KyoAni situation is so fucked. Like. So fucked I can't find words.
<<<

I cannot imagine what that must be like for you. I have no point of comparison. I hope you do find more words. It's been an honor having the chance to read your thoughts. On top of your separation from your husband and visa process (oy), this hasn't been an easy time for you.

I had a hard time finding words for this letter, but it wasn't in pain. I appreciate your giving me so much time and a chance to read about your life, to develop a theory of your mind, and to generate more balance in the information asymmetry between us. As always, it's been a pleasure.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
