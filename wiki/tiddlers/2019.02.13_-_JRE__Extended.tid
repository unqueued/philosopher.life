My brother is paying social capital to handle a serious safety issue with the fitters he works alongside. They aren't following the law and immorally so; they aren't securing their oxy. He had a near miss because of it. FUCK THAT! I wouldn't want to work around that, and nobody should have to. He's worried it makes him look like a troublemaker, but this shit matters. I've never worked on a jobsite that allowed anyone to be anything less than respectful of explosives.

The meeting yesterday was clearly tough. They watched a video about about abuse and some sisters working together to recover. My brother talked about empathy, explanation, and justification. His argument was good; those around him were a solid mix of ignorant or malicious. He understood how forgiveness and [[The Golden Rule]] applied. Ofc, the speaker thinks the shit in NY a few weeks ago implies far more than it does. =( I think it is a distraction.

We talked about my dream. My brother described some similar events. He asked me a serious question, and I joked with him first. I probably should have just answered seriously back. 

My brother is going to visit our donors. I hope it goes well for him.

He's ready for a baby. Awesome.
