Percy is witty and opinionated. We clearly have profound disagreements, but I'm pleased to see his argument. I also have strong reactions to his work here. 

Reductive about pornography (and I'm pretty reductive about it myself), and I think he's in a lot of trouble with his definition.

He neglects many of the classic definitions of identity and autonomy in philosophy. He gives a Christian perspective, and while he is clearly well-read, he doesn't dissect this issue well in the beginning. He has something going on though in a phenomenological sense. I appreciate that.

The ability to be someone else, especially on the Ring of Gyges aspect of amnesia, is not to be overlooked. It does say something about who we are. What is unacceptable about wanting to be someone else, to forget yourself? It's super easy to point out people who //ought// to feel that way, and it's really easy to justify in cases of people who have experienced trauma. Percy's interrogation here just points us to the door. He doesn't put any meat on the bones yet.

The self is nought discussion of how to reason about our tables is fucking hilarious. It's dialectical and Kierkegaardian. He's very talented at coming up with analogies and thought experiments.
