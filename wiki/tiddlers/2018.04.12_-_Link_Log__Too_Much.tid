*** Thank you! Yes.

*** This is a weapon. Wake up, sheeple!

*** I'm so moved by it! They are part of the reason I care so much about video in the first place.

*** Glad to have escaped it.
** https://aeon.co/essays/why-its-as-hard-to-escape-an-echo-chamber-as-it-is-to-flee-a-cult
*** I disagree on whether or not people really care so much about the truth. It is not my experience as a philosopher in the world that others have the knack or desire for it. Anyone who isn't willing to [[Question Everything]] all the way down to their axioms is hardly interested in the truth...I spoke too soon. The author knows exactly where I want to go with this.
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/members-of-congress-cant-possibly-regulate-facebook-they-dont-understand-it
*** I'm sorry, I really don't respect technologically illerate people who otherwise had a choice not to be ignorant.

* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/04/us-military-failing.html
*** Actually not as hard hitting as I would be.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8bltt3/cmv_despite_getting_heavily_downvoted_uspez_was/
*** Sad to see people not value free speech.
** http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/10/why-dcs-low-graduation-rates/
*** That was my experience as a public school teacher too.

*** Shocker what wealth buys you.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** http://www.cracked.com/blog/13-myths-about-society-too-many-people-believe/
*** I suppose my time in the cracked sun is over.

* Think About It
** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0020-7
*** Another reason we are fucked. Investment to pound dat pussy could not be higher, right?
** http://worthyinside.com/how-to-stop-assuming-people-dont-like-you-to-solve-90-of-your-social-problems/
*** Definitely an interesting read. I hate to say it, but my social problems stem from a multitude of instances of being on the ends of bellcurves. I'm not an agreeable person, and you figure that out real fast with me.

*** Watched this with the kids. Very enjoyable.

**** Also this, despite the fact that TED has cultic tendancies.
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/09/why-americas-return-to-1-trillion-deficits-is-a-big-problem-for-you/
*** Wapo trash as usual. Cut military funding, single-payer healthcare, pay people to goto secondary school (and make public schools the absolute best; you should be ashamed you didn't make the cut to go public), force a living minimum wage (per district) and UBI, and deficit spend into physical and digital infrastructure. Oh, and let's have proper public-key crypto FOSS voting, campaign finance reform, and progressively tax the living fuck out capital gains, inheritance, and high-income. Fuck it, might as well hold people responsible actually responsible too and radically alter our prison industrial complex. Shit, I have a thousand things to say.

* Fishy
** https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dark-side-of-the-enlightenment-1523050206
*** WSJ. Strong words. This is not how I would go about attacking Kant, nor do I think this is the best presentation of his thought. I'm not convinced this person really understands the philosophers he's speaking about.
** https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences
*** The article is fascinating. Problematically, the author just glosses over how capitalism already employs this "soft paternalism" in a dizzying array. The lack of consent is a deep problem, and I think the author is too Libertarian to have the integrity to look at that quagmire of a problem.
