!! Audit:

* Goddamn, look at that snake-creature!
* Somehow there's another conversation going on here that isn't [[audit]] about the state of the wiki.
** I wish I knew what it meant, how it worked, etc.
** This is bullet commentary. It's like lightning flashes.
* I am meme-ing and emoting hard in here. This feels super limbic to me.
* I hate to say it, but some of these simply aren't worth commenting. I fear I would abuse any option to not make any comment. I need to hold myself accountable.
** Voldy being a fine exception with clear rules.
* As usual, I have mixed feelings about the dead links.
** It's a sign of progress.
** It's ugly as hell. It's breaking.
*** I don't want to burn aliases on this bullshit.
*** There may be ways to help automate the task of healing it later.
**** I'm not sure I SHOULD "fix" that. It has it's own narrative, and the search function works just fine, homie (and will improve).
***** I could offer both somehow? What if I just went `[[foo|bar]]`? That solves it.
* The [[title.Title]]s are so loud to me.
** In fact, this is painful.
* I think this log makes for an astounding case example about the nature of persistent identities. 
* Wow, this is an emotional log; I celebrate that here.
** It's [[fastmind]] oriented.
** That is fascinating considering how quantitatively structured it is. There is [[Self-Dialectic]] going on here. This is a double-sided medium to regurgitate and structure qualia and [[/b/]]ish content even.
*** HRMM! This is ridiculously [[/b/]]ish! Why do I forget that? I know it sometimes, and othertimes I just don't.
**** You can only access so much at one time, homie. You are [[fff]].
* I am weaving with myself here.
* This is structurally most similar to [[Link Log]], but it's [[Wiki Audit]] that gives me the anxiety of [[Link Log]].
* Is this the heart of the wiki practice?
** This is so bottom-up-ish and emotional.
** [[Wiki Audit]] feels top-downish (that's in part why I suck so fucking much at it). 
** This is [[FO]]ish even (despite attempts to be [[SO]]ish about [[New]] itself).
* I still don't know what I'm doing, but I'm so fucking proud of it. Lol!
