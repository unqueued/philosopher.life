Got my seat installed on boat. New bench seat. It's alot more complicated than it sounds. Had to remove seat from a truck, remove all fabric and foam. Measure. Cut out a middle section of frame, weld frame back together with renforcement doublers. Paint for corrosion prevention. Cut out same are in foam. Glue foam back together then re install fabric and cut at one end. Then fab up mounting brackets and install fasteners to floor. No simple task. I wish I took more pics.

That seat fits like a glove.
AUG 18 7:32 PM
Yeah, some extra work. I can't complain, got a good price and it pulls a tube. Runs about as fast as a v8 big boat.
AUG 18 7:32 PM
30mph on the water feels like 60mph. For sure.
AUG 18 7:32 PM
Aye, and can feel even stronger if there are other boats.
AUG 18 7:33 PM
That looks peaceful.
