We were put into torque class we were supposed to attend weeks ago. We came in a day later. The teacher rushed the content from yesterday thankfully. Below are my notes. I had to take tests at the end of the day for certifications.

This class is funded by Snap-on. It is one large advertisement. Even the walls are plastered in Snap-on advertisements, in a government-owned facility. The teacher is constantly selling to us. We could have learned this in probably 2 hours. The goal is to get the students accustomed to Snap-on tools. 

Mechanical Torque:

* Length x Force = Torque
* The ASME accuracy is from 20-100% of the full scale.
* Prior to use, set the wrench to 50% of the full scale and exercise the wrench at least three times in both directions.
* The minimum recommended cycle for recalibration is one year.
* Formula
** TA = Torque Applied (the value you want to pull)
** TW = ?? pull wrench set ??
** (TA x L) / L + Adapter = TW

* Always store wrench at the lowest setting (not zero)

* Verify the needle setting is at zero on Dial type torque wrenches before use. 

I need to ask my brother if he uses a torque wrench/screwdriver for his electrical work. 



ID a Standard (American) bolt:

* Bolts with three straight lines indicate you are working on a standard bolt 
** Take the number of lines and add 2 to find the Grade
*** e.g. 3 lines would be grade 5
** Most common grades: 2, 5, and 8
** The higher the grade, the stronger the steel.

* e.g. 1/4 x 20 x 2, Grade 5
** First number is Diameter of bolt measured at the shank
** Second number is the number of threads per inch (TPI), thread pitch
** Third number is the Length of the bolt, from the bottom of the head to the bottom of the bolt
*** Don't include the width of the head

ID a standard (American) nut:

* A standard nut has grades. 
** If you have two marks with a point between then: grade 5
** If you have two marks side by side on points, then: grade 8
** Grade 2 has no marks

Metric bolt:

* e.g. M8 x 1.25 x 30, Grade 8.8
** First number, M8 is the diameter in MM on the shank
** Second number, thread pitch, MM from crest to crest. Measures from the from the top of one thread to the top the next thread.
** Third number, length in millimeters

** They write the grade on the bolt
* If you have two numbers on the bolt:
** First number is tensile strength MPA (megapascals)
** Second number is % of tensile strength, gives you the yield point
*** Yield point = where a bolt stretches beyond its elasticity

Metric Nut:

* If you see a number 8, then it is metric grade 8 bolt. 

There are 4 phases of fastening:

* Run-down
** The free running of the nut down the bolt
* Alignment
** When we get to components to act as one solid piece
* Elastic
** Where the bolt stretches and snaps back to maintain its size
* Plastic
** Do not do; this is the permanent deformation of a bolt.

90/10 rule:

* 90 percent of all pressure applied is to overcome friction
* 10 percent of all pressure applied is to stretch the bolt


This is an open book test, rofl.

The first test is torque theory test. Click on the eyeball.

Page numbers to reference during the test:

* 10-15
* 17-24 (definitions)
* 26-27 (markings)
* 30 (markings)
** bolt is a spring
* 43 
** torque is expressed in length and weight units
*** length x force = torque
* 50-51
* 53
* 57-58

Anything that increases friction reduces torque:

* Lubrications decreases friction, increases clamping force
* Rust does the opposite
