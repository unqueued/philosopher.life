title: Puns

//Abandon hope all ye who enter here. A good pun is it's own reword. Terrible jokes, the humblest absurdities, the clearest unintelligibilities, and the simplest mindfucks will make you want to KYS. Some of them are a bit dark, some of them are anti-humor, and some of them are just boringly ironic one-liners that force the audience to question the validity and value of their own existence. I need to keep puns out of the other collections; it's an infection control problem. [[Puns]] and [[MY WIFE IS KILLING ME: A Pun Anthology]] form the most sadistic limb of this wiki by a long shot.//
