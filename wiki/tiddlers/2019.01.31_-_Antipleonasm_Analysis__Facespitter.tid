This is a fascinating claim. It's clear to me that laughing at the absurd is sometimes the only constructive option left. I think this depends on the context. Sometimes humor is the kindest form of combat available. Importantly, the issue at stake, to my eyes, is far more than just "the ability to take a joke" as a useful social lubricant. I admire a version of the sentiment in her claim. I agree that we should radically take our lives seriously. Meaning is usually that meaningful. The ability to spit in your own face and laugh at yourself, however, is fundamentally necessary to engaging in honest [[self-dialectic]].<<ref "loo">> I am all-too-often the fool.

The ability to make fun of yourself, e.g. [[Why You Might Hate Me]], is a valuable part of self-examination and reflective critique. You should be able to make the best ad hominem attacks against yourself far more effectively than any opponent you ever meet. Stoicly immunizing yourself (appropriately), actually taking the logs out of your own eye, seeing the value in changing your mind (and putting down your tentpegs), and accepting your mistakes while being willing to take the risk of making more of them as you commit yourself in the evolution of your [[4DID]] is crucial.

As to my usual criticism, [[Ayn Rand]], you spittoon of spittle, you don't even have a coherent attempt at a definition of evil except that which doesn't maximize your hyperindividualist pursuit of hedonism (and power). Your definition of evil is subjective to the point that it has no unconditional or universal meaning. Moreover, "psychologically" to whom? Beyond that, I think it's obvious that using one's autonomy to become a dark-triad like you is definitionally the worst psychologically-based evil you can do to yourself and [[others]]. Don't worry: if you can't spit in your own face; I'll do that for you.<<ref "f">> It's, like, [[The Golden Rule]]. In [[T42T]], may I cure you of your blindness. `/spit`; be healed.
