title: 2019.01.18 - Prompted Introspection: 25 Forever

!! What would you do if you would stay 25 forever?

That is a fascinating age choice. I think most people choose their early 20's or even younger. If I am to be [[redpilled]] about this number, I suggest it is due to an increasing recognition of extended adolescence (further exacerbated by LSC) and appreciating how our frontal lobes develop.

Is this Ground Hog Year or Highlander? Forever is a hell of a claim. I do not know what it means to say a finite, physical thing will last forever. That probably will dictate quite a bit of what [[The Grand Dialectic]] even means. 

From what I understand, the human brain has an absurd mount of memory available to it. Can't be infinite, but I would love to know the limits. 

I cannot say I'd want to live forever. This is a time-honored problem in story-telling. I do not have the answer.
