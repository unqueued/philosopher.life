!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Virtue is debased by self-justification.
<<<

Voltaire comes out swinging. 

I'll agree that piety contests and virtue signaling for the sake of something other than acting from duty are immoral, deceptive, and clearly not fully virtuous. I'll also agree that conceptions of "self-justification" which amount to confabulatory attempts to preserve our identities without facing the truth [[irwartfrr]] are clearly vicious as well. Deception uses minds, including our own (though self-deception is borderline paradoxical), and often as mere means. Further, failing to act from duty lacks moral merit. Since Moral Virtue is unified, any form of self-justification along these lines debase or disunify what might otherwise have been a more complete instance of virtue.

Voltaire, of course, is more realpolitik than philosopher in some cases. His satire may not be sophistry, but it's laden with rhetoric. Here's where the nitpick comes: justified self-justification does not unjustifiably debase anything from an objective point of view. What counts as self-justification? I assume it is more than a causal explanation, and I see it as a moral property (which perhaps comes in [[dok]]). [[The Right]], for example, is self-justifying (or, at least insofar as it just is [[The Good]]). [[The Right]] is virtue itself, though I cannot claim it is a virtuous agent. Note, of course, that which is self-justified need not be the same target of that which is based in the quote either; and, even on that interpretation, the debasement does not obviously follow. 

That aphorism is witty, but it is not careful enough.
