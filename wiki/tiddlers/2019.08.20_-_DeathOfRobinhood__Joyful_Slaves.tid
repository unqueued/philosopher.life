title: 2019.08.20 - DeathOfRobinhood: Joyful Slaves

Dear DeathOfRobinhood & Selah,

It's fantastic to hear from you. You'll have to pardon my disorganization here. My transition to [[m16]] has been bumpy, and accounts that normally stay up 24/7 haven't.

<<<
Hi h0p3,

I hope you and your family are doing well!
<<<

We are doing well. It's been a whirlwind, but a good one so far. Jumping back into the Fall season has been fruitful.

<<<
The news I am sharing with you is that I am recently engaged to the angel Selah.
<<<

Congratulations! This is amazing; let us make joyful noise. I am ecstatic for you! Your spouse has been on my mind since [[your letter|2019.06.22 - DeathOfRobinhood: Response 2ITI]]. I can only begin to imagine what this means for both of you.

I don't think most people know why or what they are supposed to be looking for in the desert,<<ref "t">> but you do. Your wisdom bleeds out of you. I am sorry that you have had to wander so long to find her, and I am so glad you have. I wish you both lifelong justified eudaimonia together. In sacramental covenant, may you spiral, bind yourselves together, and become sublated by that which matters most, the Holy Word [[Itself]]. Amen.

Selah is an Celestial whose work entails the shadowing, instructing, and caring for, of teenagers with severe developmental disabilities.

Her lovely arms and hands, great masts from which hang the banners of love, are scarred from the countless unmoderated deathgrips of ones in the grips of fear and love. Her smile, which flashes like lightning from the east to the west, has gaps delved by the sudden blind jolts of ones living in dark cognitive prisons. Her heart is a vast mine, its chambers adorned with the jewels of patience and compassion. She is the one who has pledged to cast her lot with this petty, soft-wristed wretch before you.
<<<

She is a woman of [[The Good]]. Surely, neither of us live up to her. Let us learn to become like her. I am honored to know she exists; she fills me with [[hope]] in dark days. We are lucky to know our wives.<<ref "m">> They cause us all to stop and listen, to hang and measure, and to pause between the melodic fragments of our lives. I sit in a moment of joyful and terrifying silence with you now.

May your blessing be a blessing to all. May you be parents to all the children who know you both. May you be beacons of light who heal and teach others what [[love]] really means all the way down. May you be examples of [[The Other]] grafted together in the desert, and may all who know you see Christ.

<<<
I would like to tell you more about how we met, but this may have to wait until you too believe in miracles.
<<<

I do not see why my beliefs about miracles should preclude your openly telling me the truth. I would like to know how you met and to know the stories of your lives, but that is up to you. I cannot do this work for you. If it makes it easier on you, and if you wish my absolute silence on the topic for this occasion, you shall have it, nomad.<<ref "a">>

<<<
So!

...we're still figuring out a date, but we've agreed on an unostentatious ceremony that places Christ as the focal point and that honours the unhonoured in our community.
<<<

Preach, yo! You mark it well. Blessed be you all.

<<<
Rejoice with me; weep with me; for this too is a death,

Ivan
<<<

I do. I wish you joy and wisdom beyond my own in your exalting deaths, sir and madame, slaves of The One.

[[Love]] and Selah,

[[h0p3]]
