title: 2018.04.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: Greatest Success

!! What do you feel is your greatest success?

I believe I was recently answered what is likely a semantically identical question here: [[2018.03.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Greatest Achievement]].

I do not know what the difference between success and achievement are. Insofar as there is no difference, I've not changed my mind about the previous answer. 

Can you achieve something without it being a success? Can you have a success that isn't an achievement? I suppose achievements might have a connotation of recognition. Achievements might be virtue signals, badges we wear to demonstrate what we have succeeded at, what requirements we've met, etc. Perhaps a success is something broader than achievement on this view.

That said, I don't think my answer has really changed. I think my work on this wiki, my life's work, my life itself, is the greatest success I've...achieved. Perhaps there is something greater though. Now we hark back to Aristotle's Teleology. What exactly makes anything a success then requires answers crucial questions about the nature of [[The Good]]. I feel I'm in good company when I say: `I don't know`. I am trying to find the answer though. =)
