title: 2019.07.18 - Wiki Review: Le Do

* [[2019.07.17 - SWW: Wiki stuff]]
** I'm not convinced she's* reasoning about the links.
* [[SWW]]
** She'll need to offer a namechange. 
* [[1uxb0x: Daddydo]]
** Ditto.
* [[j3d1h: Daddydo]]
** Sillilly named.
* [[1uxb0x: TDL]]
** I will need to start coming up with more ideas for him.
* [[k0s3hk: Honeydo]]
** I hope she uses it. If not, that's okay. Syncing may make this better.
* [[j3d1h: TDL]]
** I have a feeling I will be handing her a ton.
* [[k0sh3k: TDL]]
** It's not working!
* [[TDL: Standing]]
** [[Pin]] is finally able to breathe now.
* [[2019.07.17 - Wiki Audit: TDL & Sync]]
** It appears he took one look at J.D.'s excellent work and gave up on his own. That is fascinating, since I think his much closer to where the final product should go. He was dismayed, and I understand: he put a lot of working into what he had.
* [[Family: TDL]]
** I'm becoming a //caption// whore for these tabs. 
* [[Family: Youdo]]
** I'm sure I will put a ton in here.
* [[Family: Medo]]
** Will this get used? I hope so. I have no idea what my offspring are going to ask me to do. Might be a place for just humor for now.
* [[TWGGF: Jibberjabber]]
** Molecular testing. It feels like data tiddlers. I agree with TonyM's word of "polluting" tags.
* [[TDLs]]
** Oh, I finally have a place that might work. I'm excited. I'm interested to see what can be done for syncing across our wikis as well.
* [[Pins]]
** The pinboard is real now. I'm moving into new territory where I will begin to strip out and actually ephemeralize aspects of my wiki.
* [[2019.07.17 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Certainly, Certainly, My Dear]]
** It's rare that I transclude. This also felt like a throwaway non-answer. Maybe I shouldn't have responded to it instead? I do, after all, have a choice in the matter.
* [[2019.07.17 - Prompted Introspection: Jop]]
** Well, perhaps it is acquaintence now. Friendships are rare and hard to find. Reminds me of some of the wealthier European nations. 
* [[2019.07.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Got Dam]]
** Completed. And, I'm talking about my literal dreams while writing about another's today. Hrm.
* [[2019.07.17 - TDL: Whatchagonna]]
** Dryer works, snipes successful (thinking about a third for work), and letter writing to some extent.
** Yeah, the wiki is ridiculously overambitious. I'm not sure what to cut. It must simmer for now.
* [[2019.07.17 - Wiki Review: Outstanding]]
** I'm participating more directly with those who might be more interested in my wiki. I'm not going for some mass campaign, but I'd like to reach out to people who might be interested in making their own wiki.
