title: 2017.12.02 - Prompted Introspection Log: I'm a Raindrop

!! Pretend you are a raindrop falling to earth and describe your fall from the clouds.

I am a very special raindrop since I can describe myself falling. Or, am I really me? You want me to give a first-personal account of what it looks like to fall as a non-sentient raindrop, right? Let's say that, or like I'm shrunk and trapped inside a raindrop falling to earth, or something like that. 

I'm a sphere of water formed around an organic microscopic particle acting as my condensation nuclei. Besides water, my chemical composition likely includes chloride, sulfate, and nitrate anions. Depending upon my size (drop size is a result of rain intensity), the elevation from which I was formed and dropped, it would take me between 1 to 10 minutes to hit the ground. I would fall, likely with lots of other droplets until I landed on the ground or water. I'd probably be absorbed and eventually join the rain cycle again.

I suppose it would be scary and beautiful. Although, to be fair, the water I'm made of has dropped countless times in our water cycle. Answer Heraclitus and the Ship of Theseus, and I can tell you more about what I think about falling to earth as a raindrop.
