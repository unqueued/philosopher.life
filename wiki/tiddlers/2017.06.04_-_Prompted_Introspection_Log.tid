!! When are you happiest in your skin?

Define happy. Define "in your skin." This question feels like it's about uplifting joy and an overriding emotion. It might be a malaphor as well since I normally think of someone as being comfortable in their own skin. "Happiest" is an odd phrasing to my ears. If comfort-happiness, a kind of contentment, is really what I'm supposed to answer here, I might answer differently.

I think it's such a weird phrase. I don't get it. Is it implying I would be in someone else's skin? Is it implying that I am not my own skin? I can feel alien to my own body, of course. 

I also want to point out that I'm Caucasian. There are obvious privileges it grants me. Skin is such an external almost esoteric property, except for its immune properties (super useful there). 

Hrmm. I feel happiest in my own skin when I feel like I belong where I'm at in a purpose-filled way. I'm an existentialist. I've been trained to adore those moments. I don't think I escape that pursuit. That's okay though.
