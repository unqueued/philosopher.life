* Ha, you know that shit you said you wanted to do yesterday? Yup. That stuff, lol.
* A mini-shopping until Thursday or Friday sounds good. Veggies are almost out. 
** We could get by though...
* Your wife's tummy isn't feeling good. Make it easy on her.
* Checkin with le offspring. I'm feeling good about the fact they've gotten something done. This was a test, and we have not failed miserably.
* Yo, dat letter, homie: but, ofc the definitions.
