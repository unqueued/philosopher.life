title: Happiness

Wikipedia says:

<<<
Happiness is a mental or emotional state of well-being defined by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy.[1] Happy mental states may also reflect judgements by a person about their overall well-being.[2] A variety of biological, psychological, economic, religious and philosophical approaches have striven to define happiness and identify its sources. Various research groups, including positive psychology and happiness economics are employing the scientific method to research questions about what "happiness" is, and how it might be attained.

That's a good starting place, but it lacks substance. It's really hard to define because happiness has subjective components to it. It makes sense why it is hard to give a universalized, objective account of this concept. Perhaps happiness boils down to experiencing what we want and need, or perhaps it is what we would want or need assuming we were in an epistemically ideal position to decide. Perhaps it is something else entirely. We may never actually know, but we all act on the assumption that we do know to some extent (else we couldn't act). 

Importantly, each of us spends time figuring out what we think happiness is (some more than others, some more consciously than others, etc.), giving substance to the concept. It is our pragmatic plight as humans that we put our tent-pegs down (and sometimes move them) on a usable definition of happiness. Humans innately come with genetically-founded categories in their minds to interpret the worlds around them (hence why empiricism is not a complete description of our knowledge), and some initial concept of happiness is no exception. 

I believe at least part of our concept of happiness is a construct in the algorithm that comprises the rewards center of our brains. Of course, there are other emotional and intellectual components to how we define and employ the concept of happiness. 

A pragmatic, intuitive definition of happiness is embedded in the faster-acting part of our minds. Our Kantian, deontic, and also virtue-theoretic reasons, beliefs, and inferences are part of that gutteral, intuitive, emotional parts of our brains. Unfortunately, it is the source of confabulation, but we cannot escape using this tool. As a practical matter, we simply must rely upon those judgments and decisions which occur in the blink of an eye. It is our goal to train our intuition, to shape it, to habituate it in the right direction. Some people have extremely accurate "gut feelings" because they reliably trained themselves. Similarly, our faster-acting 

Our slower-acting, more deliberate frontal lobes also give shape to how we understand happiness. This is where we engage in 


While I've studied the concept of happiness for a while now, I don't claim to have the answer. I can only give you my best approximation and set of concerns for it. I am hopelessly unable to transfer my body of thoughts on this topic to you. Here's a distilled, stilted, and oversimplified set of my thoughts on the concept of happiness:

Happiness is likely some form of classic //eudiamonia// theoretically definable in terms of utility. Happiness is not some nicely monolithic or easily measured kind of flourishing or well-being, but whatever the standard may be, there are objective measurements to it. I'm forced to ask certain initial questions:

* What does it mean to flourish as a human being? 
* Are there different kinds of human flourishing, just as there are different kinds of humans? 
* Pleasure is (or at least can be) a part of happiness, but what are the other parts?
* What parts are necessary for my flourishing, and what configurations of parts are sufficient for my flourishing?
* How do I know which instances of flourishing are better than others?


I see my flourishing as including basic necessities, but also a great deal of moral luck (technical term).

Clearly, I have strong hedonic and eudaimonic intuitions on the meaning of happiness. I have no problem with that.
