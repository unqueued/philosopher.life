!! Where do you think VR is going?

I'd broaden this to include reality augmentation, which can be a form of VR or not, but the principle is the same. We build for ourselves experience machines. That's the ticket, yo. We are constantly building experience machines for ourselves. It's about giving ourselves the Narratival Drugs that satisfy our desires and lead to Eudaimonia the most. 

So, I expect to see more and more immersive worlds. Video games have led the way for a long time. They've understand how to tap into the addictive parts of out brains with skinner boxes. These drugs aren't illegal, not yet. We will see. Asian Hyperclasses try to coerce their prole workforce into not playing video games through censorship and illegalizing. 

I think those who control the internet will have enormous influence into how VR evolves, I hate to say. It bottlenecks us.
