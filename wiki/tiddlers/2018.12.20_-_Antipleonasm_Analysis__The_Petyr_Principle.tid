title: 2018.12.20 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Petyr Principle

!! Respond to the following: 

<<<
Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason they could possibly have for saying what they say and doing what they do? Then I ask myself, "How well does that reason explain what they say and what they do?"
<<<

Ah, you do us a great service again, Petyr. 

Charitably, we must argue that Petyr does not have certainty in his development of theories of mind. It turns out that in the ideal, perfect empirical calculation, all possible motivations are examined, including the worst motivations (where "worst" here, presumably, is understood in terms of the moral merit of that maxim). Of course, ain't nobody got time fo' dat.

Whether or not one ought to engage in assuming the worst is a different question. I submit the reason Petyr might assume the worst also isn't the only conceivable reason why one should engage in this strategy. It is possible this strategy is valid even if Petyr's motives (ironically) for selecting this strategy lacks merit itself.

It is my experience that exploring the limits of spectrums teaches you a great deal about the nature of that spectrum. Efficiently overcoming diminishing margins in our reasoning about others means we explore both directions. What does the worst and best look like?

Perhaps there are softcaps; we can be too outlandish and paranoic. For example, it is easy to imagine logical possibility rather than physical possibility. I think we can safely set these aside. Look at that pragmatism and willingness to be wrong in Petry's condition. He's looking for confidence intervals. Clearly, he is quite skilled in his story. Unfortunately, I have found his rule-of-thumb to be necessary (though insufficient) lens through which to interpret others (among the many lenses I must use). Time and time again, this is one of the better explanations of human behavior; psychological egosim tends to be quite accurate.

[[T4T]] is ruthless and weighs heavily upon that question, particularly since it does not come to the table with any assumptions that there are any [[others]] would play a more cooperative and forgiving game. [[T42T]] assumes faith in [[The Other]], even if only 3% in my case; I owe them a great deal, even if it costs me everything. Indeed, risk-assessment and Bayesian regret in today's world is likely going to point to the overwhelming personal, egoistic utility of Petyr's rule-of-thumb. In my weighing, I cannot pay exclusive credence to this argument, though it is still a profound (often overwhelming) factor.

To my current understanding, faith in [[Humanity]], even to the smallest degree,<<ref "b">> means that I am obligated by [[The Moral Law]] to bend over backward and take the risk of being exploited by psychopaths in order to [[Find The Others]].<<ref "h">> Thus, while I agree The Petyr Principle has profound merit, we can never be certain in the strategy or the result (however confident we may be).<<ref "p">> Radical freedom exists, and this is why I hold each and every one of you assholes responsible for this world alongside me.

Once again, I am indebted to my enemy. `/raises-his-glass` - I [[hope]] to sublate your memetic and genetic species, Petyr. Who else is going to stop you?

<<footnotes "p" "Note, I do not strawman Petyr in claiming he thinks the worst reason is always the best explanation. Obviously, he believes people are deluded; that's often how he wins big in some of his dialectics.">>
