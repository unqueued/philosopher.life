*** I appreciate that definition. I tend to be far broader in what I take to be capitalism. I probably have more in common with Hegel at the end of the day. Exploitation for the sake of the centralization of power: they fit the bill.

*** Martyrdom for the [[pleft]] as well. I don't think they are nearly as splintered, but their window is much smaller here. I'll agree to the psychopathic parasitism upon those amygdalas though.

*** It's a tall pyramid of enemies. They are groomed to kill grassroots revolutions. Plenty of the authorities are backing these groups though, lol. I smell bullshit.

*** Pure propaganda in here. Love the graphs. Hrm, I wonder what message they are really trying to send here. =)

*** I'd like to know what the man would have thought about [[power]]. Agency, efficient and final causes were significant weaknesses for him, from what I saw.
