It is a pleasure to meet you. How do you do, fellow kid? Please excuse the mess, make yourself at home, and let me know if I can {[[help]]} you. Thank you for coming.

To my knowledge, I'm not used to being in {[[contact]]} with someone your age through my wiki.<<ref "25">> As such, I need you to understand: I will be censoring your posts for [[PII|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information]].<<ref "p">> This is not out of malice, and I do not wish to be any more paternalistic than is necessary.<<ref "m">> Please be yourself, but do not attempt to reveal names, addresses, contact information, etc. in your conversations with me; I will be actively attempting to provide you some degree of anonymity.<<ref "r">> In contrast, however, you will not have privacy in your communications with me unless I have a [[good]] reason. Please pretend the entire world is reading what you say to me (because they could if they wanted to).<<ref "y">>

I assure you, it is my job to tease and make fun of everyone,<<ref "e">> including you and [[j3d1h]]. If I understand correctly, traditionally, I'm supposed to offer you a story which embarrasses my offspring. You will decide if I do so.

This is a bi-directional interview, right? I'd like to get to know you better. I have some [[fancy questions|Getting to Know Someone in X Questions]] for you:

{{Getting to Know Someone in X Questions}}

That's probably too many questions. Feel free to answer whatever you are comfortable answering. What questions can I answer for you? 

Oh, also, my daughter says you have an RP character who believes the following:

<<<
a man is not to be judged by the action, but its intent
<<<

You caught my eye with this fascinating claim. What's your inspiration? What do you think about this character? What do you think the world would be like if everyone agreed to such a claim?

I hate to say it, but I'm not a very good RPer.<<ref "d">> I haven't really been playing many mere [[Games]] recently. This is a character I'm building to play with my family: [[Sir Prasino Keimeno Arkouda of Ingtown]]. I'd love to know your insights into RPing, the meaning of games and stories, and how you relate to them.

I've thought about what else I might add to this letter (some of my letters tend to be somewhat lengthy). I'm going to cut it short for now. It's good to meet you. I [[hope]] we can become good friends.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
