title: 2019.08.22 - Prompted Introspection: 5 Years

!! Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Answering this question again with no prediction in which I have confidence beyond this answer. I will always be lost in the desert, hopefully still with [[m16]], helping my [[love]]d ones, and, if I'm lucky, being useful and happy. The world grows darker. I am convinced the best of our lives are behind us; I hope I will have the integrity to do the best I can with what I have in the future.
