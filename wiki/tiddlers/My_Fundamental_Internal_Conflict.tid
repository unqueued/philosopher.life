title: My Fundamental Internal Conflict

I'm split between my [[Slowmind]] (which is deliberative, slower-acting, concentrated in the frontal lobes, dealing in utilitarianism) and my [[Fastmind]] (Kantian, faster-acting, gutteral, intuitive).

I see my intuitions cannot be trusted. My Fastmind has excellent reasons not to trust my Slowmind, and vice versa. This has been a big deal, especially for an xNTJ. 

I am re-writing my intuitions to some very significant extent. There is a clash in me. I must use reason to reshape myself. I'm doing what Virtue theory is literally talking about in terms of habituating character and excellent of practice.

Problematically, reason, as far as I can see, is very selfish. It is a scientific fact that the most rational part of our brains tends to stray from altruism and into egoism. How can I be moral and happy at the same time? How can I be reasonable and fittingly empathic at the same time?

I am autistic. This only further convolutes the problems.

The goal is to create a cooperation between my Slowmind and my Fastmind. My Fastmind is rational enough to see it will be destroyed by the Slowmind if it becomes adjusts intuitions too quickly and radically across the board. 

This is the source of my phenomenological appearance of not being free. It's because I wasn't. It's because my Slowmind and Fastmind are in a prisoner's dilemma with each other.

Understanding empathy, psychopathy, and autism has helped clear this up. Positive Disintegration helps me understand it much better.
