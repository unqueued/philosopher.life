!! About:

//Where I contemplate my erotic-sounding career aspirations. I obviously hope my pipedream isn't what it sounds like, but instead is realistically attainable. I will be practical and stoic in my pursuit of excellence.//

My trade(s) should a means to my ends. Happiness, of course, but the means to that happiness is what I'm aiming at here. The trades are stepping stone, but perhaps not my destination. I do want to own my own business.

!! Principles:

Understanding where it is you want to end up in your career is obviously not simple. One thing I take into account is the Peter Principle. Given my background and breadth of knowledge, I could actually fit a large number of industries at a variety of levels. Just because I look good on paper doesn't mean I'm really a good fit though. Being an autistic person makes life complicated, in addition to the fact that I generally strongly dislike people. The Peter Principle is highly applicable to me. It is very easy for me to find myself in a position where I'm seemingly qualified, but there is a region, often a social one, which ultimately precludes me from being a proficient worker in that position.

Given both my ineptitudes and misanthropy, limiting social interactions to politely-hostile business interactions with minimal actual socializing is likely my best chance. I can small talk when I feel it is necessary given the context. Ultimately, I must be the judge of what counts as using people. Of course, I can only do my best not to.

I want to own the means of production. I'd like to be my own boss. I'd like to have a job worth doing in every sense, and I want to feel free instead of politically and economically enslaved (or mitigate my enslavement as much as possible).

Owning a business may require working with other people, and at least includes working for people since even the self-employed are technically employed via their customers. It would be wise to limit or spend extra time thinking about our interactions, since I'm autistic. Being empathic is something I need to work hard on; I need to understand their minds and feelings. I need to know how we should interact (expectations, patterns, etc.). It's worth treating people respectfully, even the honest shopkeeper knows that. I need to be at peace with myself, to be unified, while I make money. Think carefully, and act wisely. How do I do it well? What is the most effective path? 

Starting late in life on the moneypath is not a terrible thing. Now better than never, and I have tools. I have a picture of how it influences earnings potential, opens and shuts doors, etc. But, I also haven't been wasting my time. I have learned quite a bit. 

Further, can you change social mores? They evolve, of course, but how many people really shape them in a moral manner? It is already difficult enough living with my own moral standards, let alone trying to logically fit it together into a world filled with people who generally lack any semblance of a strong and coherent point of view in ethics. I'm like a puzzle piece, and I need to find the best fit for myself in the world. Not only do I want my world to be coherent to me, but I need it to be coherent for me. 

I am not thinking big enough in terms of my career. I'm a fucking genius. What am I doing? I'm shooting too low, not for the stars. I want a job that has all three: 

* Is fun and interesting, provides novel experiences
* Is moral
* Makes a fuckton of money

Maybe thats a //Dreamjob// with a capital "D." I should still shoot for it.

Sure, I'm picking up useful skills and I'll always be able to find a job. That's a solid starting place. Generate money for a house. Good, and what after that? How do I spend our money to maximize our happiness? My wife would be happy if she never had to work again. That is the gift I want to give her for everything she has given me. I can make my kids exceedingly happy by allowing us to be our own bosses, make money, have fun, working together, and having the security we need.
