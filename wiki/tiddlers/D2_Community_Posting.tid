Hi, I'm h0p3. 

I've played video games since Atari, but Diablo 2 was the first game I ever became addicted to (Everquest immediately after it). I've never played with DClone, Ubers, or many of the new powerful runewords before because I stopped seriously playing the game a couple months after LOD came out. I'm pleased to see there is so much new gear and content to play with.

I also have no interest in playing online since it ruins the difficulty of the game for me. I'm a strong trader in every game with an economy I play, and playing the market instead of the game is the wildly better way for me to advance than actually playing. In the name of playing the game rather than the market, I'm going to play it solo exclusively. I refuse to connect with anyone. I want it to be up to me as much as possible. I want to earn it according my rules.

Disclaimer: I'm using a famous mod-that-shall-not-be-named, 1.13. You are free to delete my post if you believe it necessary (I don't see the value in that censorship, but that's up to your community). Of course, I despise editors (takes all the fun out of it), but this has sane limits to my taste while providing the Ubers (which is why I'm trying out D2 again in the first place) with ergonomic in-game muling (I'm a highly visual person). The mod enables stat resets, and I accept this given how I'm giving up the ability to rush characters with the help of others in a matter of hours; it was one of the aspects of the game I always despised (Blizzard got this right in WoW). I realize some users are hostile to this famous mod I use, and I apologize if I've offended your sensibilities. Believe me, I won't be infecting your game states by joining any game with you (and you won't be infecting the purity of mine either).

Despite my presumable heathen status, I hope to politely participate in discussions here. I believe we share a great deal in common in our playstyles.

My rules of play:

* Excepting the mod and Wine (for Linux), I cannot use any third-party tools to modify the game in any way (no memory reading/editing, no modifying game files, etc.). 
* I cannot use automation of any kind.
* I cannot use the network (no online trading, no multi-boxing, no help, etc.).
* I cannot reset stats/skills more than once in any given game instance (no cheesing against immunities, etc.).
* I cannot modify my naked stats below the requirements to wear every piece of gear (calculated before I put my gear on).

I maintain a wiki/blog for myself, including my D2 journaling and planning here: https://philosopher.life/#Diablo%202:%5B%5BDiablo%202%5D%5D.

Here's the skinny:

I made an assassin to get to Nightmare Baal and farm for basic gear. I then twinked a sorc and farmed Hell Mephisto a couple thousand times (I collected most of the uniques/sets, etc.); these runs have been instrumental to my progress. I twinked all the other classes and brought them to Hell. My assassin killed DClone first, and my necro was the first to clear Baal. 

I farmed countess for runes, and I'm starting to build some runewords I've never used before. I'm growing concerned that I don't have a prayer of getting the highest runes, but I did have a Jah drop for my necro in the Throne room last week (I believe it's worth more than the sum total of everything that has dropped for me so far). I would desperately love to find the last piece for Engima. It would change the game for me tremendously; I hope it will be completed some year.

Ultimately, gearing up the melee classes will be very difficult. I've been leveling and gambling (~150 million gold so far) in pursuit of rare jewelry that would round out my characters. I've not produced anything from crafting which matters, but I've had some decent gambles.

I've not tried the Ubers. From my reading, I believe my necro, paladin, and assassin each have a chance of pulling it off (with current gear), but farming the keys is expensive enough (timewise), even with my Nature's Peace, that I'm waiting to guarantee I can defeat the Ubers before I go for it. Having no experience with Ubers, I can't really tell how far I need to gear up before taking them. Perhaps I should just go for it because that Torch looks sexy as hell.  

So, I'm trying to build a Death Runeword (a very high end runeword for me at this point; HOTO is the highest I've achieved otherwise) first to guarantee I pure Smite it down without questions. I'm currently farming The Pit /players 8 on my hammerdin with 0%MF to find an Ethereal BA while leveling him. 

Afterwards, I intend to rush HF and Socketquests with an army of Sorcs (one after another). I'm building a complete twink set to do these speedruns. If that doesn't pan out (the sockets alone are necessary for me, but I mean in the sense of rune drops), I'll likely farm runes in A3 (I'm feeling Countessed out). Once I feel strong on my smiter, I'll grind out a few dozen Keys of Destruction (I've got the others). 

Afterwards, the goal is to take the Necro and Paladin to 99 on Baal (since they are extremely safe and fast for me) hopefully rounding out my Elite uniques and Ethereal uniques collections while gearing up the rest of the classes to be in a good position to engage in brainlessly-safely fast Baal running to 99.

The game is much different than what I played so many years ago, but it's just as addictive as ever. I'm amazed by the power of my Merc, and I rely upon him more than I remembered ever having before.

My favorite items thus far: Jah, bunch of Ists, perfect maras, 2 SoJs, Duress, Upped Eth Shaftstop, Upped Eth Hone Sundan, my Treachery's, Arachnids, almost perfect Anni, 4x Light Facets, Crescent Moon PB, HOTO, Shaeled Eth Reaper's Toll, Ral'd Visage, Naj's Puzzler (I love it).

I've had so many of the same items drop over and over (I save a lot of items), but not a single Homunculus. I can't find 4-Socket Monarchs to save my life either. It's kind of driving me insane.

Anyways, that's my intro. Nice to meet you.
