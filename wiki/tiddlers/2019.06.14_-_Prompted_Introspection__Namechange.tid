!! If you could change you name, what would you change it to?

I like my name, it's [[h0p3]]. I picked it. I like that it represents who I [[hope]] to be, which is, of course, a non-trivial part of who I am. It's the right {[[Axiom]]} for me especially since my skill is cutting through the world, deconstruction, attack, generating negative space, etc. Forcing myself to construct top-down models and putting down tentpegs is the right approach for me.
