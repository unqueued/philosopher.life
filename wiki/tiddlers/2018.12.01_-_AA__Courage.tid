What you up to this weekend?
8 HR AGO
Bumming around till work time
6 HR AGO
We just got some LED lights to replace dead and broken ones
6 HR AGO
Cool. LEDs are nice.
6 HR AGO
We haven't replaced but one with an LED, but in time, that's what we hope to do too.
6 HR AGO
We are optimistic that this will happen with just one run to Home Depot but... no home improvement happens here without at least 5 trips and several angry outbursts and at least one cussing :serious_face_with_symbols_covering_mouth: breakdown
6 HR AGO
rofl
6 HR AGO
But... I go to work at 5 so I may get to miss it
6 HR AGO
lol /fingers-crossed
6 HR AGO
Yep
6 HR AGO
[[JRE]] replacing lights last week  without all that made [[UJ]] hopeful. I have my doubts...hehe
6 HR AGO
Time-honored traditions.
6 HR AGO
Yep yep
6 HR AGO
My nightly losing my mind trying to get my offspring to systematically do the dishes and the weekly chores. Getting them to work together is almost impossible.
6 HR AGO
Well at their age, that’s the way it is
6 HR AGO
It gets better?
6 HR AGO
lol
6 HR AGO
Nope —still haven’t reached that with my two...
6 HR AGO
/wail
6 HR AGO
Electrical work —didn’t hit the breaker first
5 HR AGO
This should be fun
5 HR AGO
=)
5 HR AGO
Thinking I may go to work early and take [[AG]].. Alexa will call 911 if necessary right?
5 HR AGO
Ha.
5 HR AGO
How do you like Alexa, btw?
5 HR AGO
She stays unplugged most of the time because the only time we hear from her is when we are yelling for [[AG]]
5 HR AGO
lol
5 HR AGO
Gpa has one and we giggle that he would freak out if he knew/thought about the fact that she is listening all the time
5 HR AGO
No doubt.
5 HR AGO
That is something I have in common with him.
5 HR AGO
We have that paranoia.
5 HR AGO
Yes :sunglasses:
5 HR AGO
Lol. The emoticon is fitting too.
5 HR AGO
I never quite got the hang of finding fitting emoticons for conversations. You seem to breathe it.
5 HR AGO
It’s hard sometimes to write emotions into written word —they are helpful and most of my day is spent with kids that use these modern hieroglyphics
5 HR AGO
True that.
5 HR AGO
How’s your weekend?
5 HR AGO
It's good. Cleaning up. [[k0sh3k]] has a migraine, so taking care of her.
5 HR AGO
Completing my monthly audit of my major logs.
5 HR AGO
Lots of Find The Other work today as well.
5 HR AGO
~~Planning to take over the world~~ Working on fun computer stuff
5 HR AGO
Might have the neighbors over
5 HR AGO
Nice!
5 HR AGO
Were scheduled for an X-mas orchestra concert today, but that is probably for tomorrow
5 HR AGO
Sorry [[k0sh3k]] is down —migraines are awful
5 HR AGO
Yes. =(
5 HR AGO
She gets them so often, always has.
5 HR AGO
It's amplified with her period.
5 HR AGO
Makes it really hard for her. She is surprisingly functional while in so much pain.
5 HR AGO
I don't know how she does it.
5 HR AGO
Yes I know —it would be nice if they could figure out a way to help her more.
5 HR AGO
Maybe as she gets older less hormones will mean less headaches?
5 HR AGO
That is exactly what we hope for.
5 HR AGO
Too bad they couldn’t help move that along...
5 HR AGO
insurance denies us the opportunity to try migraine medications as it is...doesn't matter what the neurologist says
5 HR AGO
"they" is a large structure
5 HR AGO
(my paranoia is often well-earned, imho :P)
5 HR AGO
I don’t understand why they deny things that would help other than financial reasons but with the insurance companies and the medicine producers
5 HR AGO
Yes I agree —“they” are worth being paranoid about
5 HR AGO
I'm really hoping [[k0sh3k]] gets the job in Costa Rica
5 HR AGO
Didn’t know she was applying there? Tell me more...
5 HR AGO
She'd be a branch manager/satellite director there.
5 HR AGO
Nice!
5 HR AGO
Universal healthcare. Lower cost of living. $50k a year would go a long way.
5 HR AGO
I have a hacker friend there I'd enjoy spending my time with as well.
5 HR AGO
Has she had an interview there yet?
5 HR AGO
No. She's only applied.* Sorry, I've not been clear. This is just a dream.
5 HR AGO
She did turn the job down in Bhutan though.
5 HR AGO
Ooo well I still hope it works out
5 HR AGO
Why turn down?
5 HR AGO
They pay $600 a month. Livable, but no real savings. Further, the country has lese majeste laws and are extremely xenophobic. Not a great place for kids in our reading.
5 HR AGO
The position doesn't feel right either, like it's been on rotation or something (which is a signal that admin is a problem).
5 HR AGO
That all makes sense
5 HR AGO
Good call
5 HR AGO
I guess I didn’t think about librarian jobs out of the country—that pretty neat actually
5 HR AGO
Aye. Class warfare continues to ramp up. The stats look bad for the US. I anticipate it will get worse. I've looked at Scandinavia, but it's very difficult to get sponsors.
5 HR AGO
I tend toward the ostrich approach which isn’t smart or safe but comfortably unaware?
5 HR AGO
Definitely less anxiety inducing.
5 HR AGO
Losing my mind watching the world burn.
5 HR AGO
Yeah I don’t think I am strong enough for that
5 HR AGO
I hear ya. Some days, I wish I could just stop looking at it.
5 HR AGO
I know it's bad for my health.
5 HR AGO
Reality-junky addiction
5 HR AGO
You are braver than I
5 HR AGO
