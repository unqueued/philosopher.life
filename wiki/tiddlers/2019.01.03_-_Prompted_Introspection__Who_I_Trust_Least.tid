title: 2019.01.03 - Prompted Introspection: Who I Trust Least

!! Who do you trust the least and why?

This is a non-trivial question for me. I don't think I can cleanly answer it in this space. I suppose I need to know "trust with what" because the target of my trust must be in regards to some context and objective (molecule).

Since I'm allowed to use functions to pick out any number of individuals (even if I don't personally know them), the answer appears to be dark-triads who habitually aim to avoid engaging in the [[T42T]] practice. They elect not to bind themselves with [[The Moral Law]]. Obviously, we all fail; nobody doesn't fall somewhere on the spectrum. I'm low-balling it talk about the psychopathic 10% (especially considering the reactionary infrastructures which support them). I do not trust people to be [[Good]] Humans. What else matters?

This is an important question to continue to answer. My goal in [[FTO]], as an {[[axiom]]} is to have faith [[irwartfrr]] in [[Humanity]]. I do not believe in angels (obviously), but I take the ancient hospitality tradition quite seriously. Indeed, there is something profoundly fit about that memeplex. It might not be adaptive to be a good person (hi, Saint Aristotle), but it is the [[Right]] thing to do (hi, Saint Kant). I aim to take the first major steps in building trust. I can't say I've enjoyed the process always (sometimes it has been difficult), but I am still pleased with what I'm doing here.
