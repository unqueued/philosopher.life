Personally, I find relativism a dreadful bore, while accepting that nihilism poses a fundamental philosophical challenge to any universalist ethics.  Relativism and nihilism are conceptually distinct challenges, and should not be crudely conflated.
<<<

I recognize there are differences in where they start, but I think they result in the same problem: [[The Good]] isn't objectively, externally real. What might convince a relativist might not convince a nihilist, and vice versa; they do pose different challenges. The loss of intrinsic value, however, is the same. Relativism, in a sense, is the denial of the context of all contexts, that we can particularize universals or extract larger objects. I don't see why Nihilism and Relativism aren't morally equivalent at the end of the day.

I think relativism and nihilism are two heads of the same hyperbeast I have to slay.

Nietzsche was the great analyst of nihilism, and condemned liberal progressives and reactionary politicians in the same breath for good reason
<<<

A box of contradictions. I deny his right to help himself to it.

<<<
Nietzsche was, of course, discussing how many Conservative politicians held to the values of Judeo-Christian “Western” civilization even in the admitted absence of a plausible philosophical justification.
<<<

...and why should I think Nietzsche has a plausible philosophical justification again?

<<<
There is all the difference in the world between believing that the world is objectively ordered according to the values articulated in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and believing that it would be desirable for people to believe that the world is ordered so.
<<<

Preach.

<<<
Mr. Harper and his proponents seem to believe the latter, without recognizing the Nietzschian point that this becomes morally untenable without a metaphysical foundation to back it up.
<<<

Nietzsche is a fucking a hypocrite too. I'm no longer a Christian, but it's pretty obvious to me that they have access to a very rich metaphysical foundation, including most secular attempts at securing the foundation.

<<<
They can be movements of sound and fury which signify not much else, and here we come full circle, than the egoistic aesthetic preferences of the individuals who make them up.
<<<

Agreed.
