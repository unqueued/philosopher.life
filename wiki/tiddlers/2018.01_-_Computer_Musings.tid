!! Audit:

* I am ashamed to say, but I have nothing serious to say.
* I did a good job this month.
* I feel like put out a lot of fires, started some more, and kept going on the cycle. This is part of development. We are slowly getting there. =)
* I worry I did this at the expense of other things that I needed to do.
