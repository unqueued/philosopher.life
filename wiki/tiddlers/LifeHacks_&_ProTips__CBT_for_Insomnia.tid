title: LifeHacks & ProTips: CBT for Insomnia

Placebo, mind-over-matter, call it what you will, but CBT is effective at resetting your patterns. Habituating your behavior and frame of mind works. If you have sleep performance anxiety, if you've trained yourself to believe you will sleep poorly, then you often won't sleep well. Teach yourself to sleep with confidence.


* Exercise regularly
* Limit drug use, e.g. caffeine and alcohol, et al.
* Don’t eat late at night
** If you are feeling hungry, that's possibly because sleep deprivation has lowered your leptin, leaving too much ghrelin in your system.
* Don’t nap
* Wind down an hour before bed
* Invest in your sleeping environment
** Minimal light, sound, temperatures, etc.
** Have a comfortable bed, pillows that fit your body, covers that you enjoy, etc.
* Only get in bed when you literally can't stay awake; do not directly force yourself to try to sleep.
** Sexual activity is the exception
* If you've been conscious for 15 minutes in bed, even if you thought you were going to be able to sleep, then get out and do something. 
* Get immediately out of bed when you wake up; do not linger.
* Do not change your day's schedule because of your sleep quality. 
* Do not deviate from your set sleep schedule; force your body to find your circadian rhythm.
* Journal about your sleep.
** Track when you think you fell asleep and woke up. 
** Describe how well you slept.
