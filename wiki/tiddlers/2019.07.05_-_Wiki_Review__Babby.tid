title: 2019.07.05 - Wiki Review: Babby

* [[.nvimrc]]
** Lulz. Still babby territory.
* [[.bashrc]]
** Because sometimes I have to leave zsh, and even that needs to be reasonable.
* [[dotfiles]]
** It's not really that [[Leet]] at all. Maybe I shouldn't. 
* [[.zshrc]]
** We still have some problems with autocompletion, but I hate not having it.
* [[2019.07.04 - Wiki Audit: Untagged]]
** Digging through the past of wiki is sometime digging for treasure. 
* [[publish.sh]]
** I need to teach her penetration testing (what little I understand), MS Office (I'd love to see expertise in Excel and Word), Windows Admin, OSX, and owning her Android, and probably some work in SQL and more javascript. There will be little more for me to show her.
*** Then we have to start pushing for particular projects. The girl has to start developing her own passions, or I have to hand them to her. I'd like to construct herself with her here.
* [[2019.07.04 - gh057: Construction]]
** Edited. I wish I could everyone to write their own personal sites. I feel like an evangelist.
*** Interesting to see [[kicks]]' interactions on HN today about the topic. `/applause` on the account history as personal site fragment comment. 
* [[The Remodeling: Untagged]]
** This method has been working nicely. I've had a lot of crap to remove and rename. Noice!
* [[2019.07.04 - Wiki Review: Sick Monitor]]
** I'm growing further convinced I have to transplant. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
* [[2019.07.04 - TDL: Clean]]
** What is happening. That all occurred. Impossibru.
* [[2019.07.04 - Prompted Introspection: Eating Habits]]
** Doesn't look like my wish will be coming true, at least not yet. I'll have to keep trying. I could always take a trip.
* [[2019.07.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Spigot]]
** Completed. I'm so glad we sat down to work on it. My son was anxious, and he felt like a failure during parts of the day. I'm glad he had the chance to recover and to see himself and the day from a different light.
* [[2019.07.04 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Debased]]
** Edited. I suppose I'm defending Saint Leibniz against this sumbitch.
* [[2019.07.04 - Computer Musings: Wife's Wiki Remodel]]
** After we made the first large changes, she is happy. She was stressed about it at first, but now I think her control over how it is shaped is pleasing to her. 
*** I'm super envious of how quickly she is able to [[Remodel]].
