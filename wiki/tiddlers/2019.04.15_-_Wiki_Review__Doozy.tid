title: 2019.04.15 - Wiki Review: Doozy

* [[2019.04.14 - Sphygmus: Program, Knit, & Walk]]
** I am sad to see so little of her. 
* [[2019.04.14 - Family Log: Dude, Where Is My title.Title?]]
** Added [[title.Title]].
** We need to read the "minutes" or previous entry each week.
** My daughter is getting more playful and adding more of the commentary from all of us here. Neat.
* [[2019.04.14 - K: Firing All Cyclinders]]
** Yup. I continue to screw up here.
* [[2019.04.08 - JRE: Buttdial & Wrestling]]
** Turns out, I have far more digestion to accomplish than I realized.
* [[2019.04.13 - JRE: Letters All Around]]
** I will offer my commentary here.
** A saga you are non-trivially responsible for. I wonder if that is a way to trivialize it. 
** I suggest you keep it short because there's no way you aren't going to get nailed if you go for length. False courtesy.
** Attempt to connect the past to the present through objects. Relying upon nostalgia is a poor defense. I'll believe [[SLT]] values it, but I don't think [[MWF]] gives a shit.
** There is some openness there, but I think it's important to see when there isn't and why. My brother is still going to be absurdly polite and avoid topics (or rephrase them). I wholly doubt there is complete candor. They will reaffirm that degree of candor and call it care and love. Hey, if you don't actually hold them accountable, they will be all for whatever you have to say.
** I see plenty of approval-seeking completion here.
** She has multiple accounts for the same past action, and she's reconfabulating. I'm sure she digging around for some kind of response that will seem reasonable. It really is guessing. She refuses to be open the possibility that she did the wrong thing, that she meant the wrong thing. This is no apology at all.
** Did you actually talk about evolution that much? Mind you, we were raised believing in evolution to a non-trivial extent. It's weird that this is the new version of the story to me.
** She certainly thought you might abort. Of course, it's a straight lie to say otherwise. She's only saying this now because you want children.
** She realizes her words hurt you, but she can't give you the real explanation.
** A lot clearly rides on whether or not you believe her. Why should you think this letter is sincere?
* [[2019.04.14 - JRE: Low Output]]
** He is absurdly generous to us. [[k0sh3k]] has vetoed, and I can understand why.
* [[2019.04.14 - L: Speaks Through Me Again?]]
** The meta-conversation opens about someone else, but maybe that is a segue. I am glad she has been thinking about it. [[Reply Mode]] has been a non-trivial signal here.
* [[2019.04.11 - Tasha: No Need To Apologize]]
** We'll get there when we do. I hope we get to go swimming while we have our BBQ.
* [[2019.04.12 - Tasha: Super Busy]]
** I wonder what changed their minds.
* [[2019.04.14 - Tasha: Emotional Housing]]
** Lots of doors in there.
* [[2019.04.14 - MB: Vidya Week]]
** Fixed the type.
** I'm surprised she had nothing to say about the vidya.
* [[2019.04.08 - AA: House Looks Gorgeous]]
** Those are probably the nicest looking floors I've seen except a couple Walgreens floors (with quality mixed rocks set into them) while on shrooms (hard to beat a living, swirling mural).
* [[2019.04.11 - AA: 2 Busy 4 Soda Even]]
** She has been insanely busy and productive lately. I'm really proud of her.
* [[2019.04.12 - AA: Survival Lesson Plan]]
** I've not given them tests, though they do fine for mastery testing on Khan. We have time before the SAT and ACT. We're going to spend a lot of time prepping. 
* [[2019.04.11 - AG: Good, Excited]]
** I wish she would talk about her interests. I'm clearly not a good interlocutor for her.
* [[2019.04.11 - T-Money: Return Date]]
** The diet continues. I'm having to wear a belt now. My wife is pissed off that it works (at least short term and immediately for me). I hear ya love. It aint fair.
* [[2019.04.12 - T-Money: Proud Cognitivism]]
** Seems productive. I'm surprised to see him diving into parts of my wiki.
* [[2019.04.13 - T-Money: Proud Non-Cognitivism]]
** Part of our ongoing debate where only one of us really takes reason seriously.
* [[2019.04.08 - K: Projects]]
** So many things I'd do differently given what I know now. That's how it works. I'm sure I'll say the same thing 10 years from now if I ever read this sentence then. (`/wave`)
* [[2019.04.10 - K: Pings]]
** This was funny.
* [[2019.04.11 - K: RPG & Tat]]
** If he severed the link between the two groups, he could have.
* [[2019.04.12 - K: I Open]]
** He's behind in his work in some respects. That sucks. I was (and still am) a terrible student. I hope he keeps pushing.
* [[2019.04.11 - Sho: Later]]
** Never did.
* [[2019.04.14 - Wiki Review: Metametaletter]]
** Hopefully, I won't have to wite that many. I'm already exhausted.
* [[2019.04.14 - TDL: Compromises]]
** It's taken forever to get him back into doing math. I think we've lost ground. I'm glad he has routine which is working. I'm glad we've already covered this ground too because it's easy; I am worried about when it will become hard again.
* [[2019.04.14 - Prompted Introspection: Each Member of Fam]]
** ~~N~~Mailed it(!) in.
* [[2019.04.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Bit of Chill]]
** Completed.
** So many fires, so little time.
* [[2019.04.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Democracy and Propaganda]]
** Am I getting bored? I think so, other Barry.
