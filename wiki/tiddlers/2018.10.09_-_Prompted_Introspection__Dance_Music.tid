title: 2018.10.09 - Prompted Introspection: Dance Music

!! What music makes you want to get up and dance? Why don't you?

Oh, I'm going to get real lazy right now.<<ref "o">> I'm not going to hardlink this:

<<list-links "[search:title[Prompted]search:text[music]]">>

Obviously, [[Music: Library]] skullfucks me. I dance, cry, and work my ass off to it. I'm now probably averaging music 12 hours a day since I'm using fewer audiobooks recently.
