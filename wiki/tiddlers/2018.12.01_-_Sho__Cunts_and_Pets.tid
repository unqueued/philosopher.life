What you up to this weekend?
8 HR AGO
Just chilling today; tomorrow we've got to prep the cat and caravan and drive doon tae tarbert. Really early ferry Monday
7 HR AGO
Hoping the cat doesnae pish hersel!!!
7 HR AGO
Does she fare well traveling usually?
6 HR AGO
NO
6 HR AGO
lol
6 HR AGO
But locking her in the caravan bathroom was best we could manage
6 HR AGO
I'm sorry.
6 HR AGO
That's not fun.
6 HR AGO
Just have to pray she doesnae pish herself
6 HR AGO
Maybe some catnip or hashish to help her out.
6 HR AGO
Not sure if trippin balls will help
6 HR AGO
Bc there's no way to wash her til Monday night at Ed's auntie's
6 HR AGO
Haha
6 HR AGO
I've got some all natural dairy based pet calming stuff
6 HR AGO
I forgot about it til now :/
6 HR AGO
Well. Hopefully that will smooth it out for her.
6 HR AGO
I hope. If she pees tomorrow, she cannae come out of bathroom for 24 hours, and we cannae go in :weary:
5 HR AGO
How do you all transport the furry chairman etc?
5 HR AGO
hehe
5 HR AGO
We've done it with and without cages.
5 HR AGO
They seem okay if there are people there.
5 HR AGO
She wasnae so bad when she was younger
5 HR AGO
It seems to have gotten worse since a couple of summers ago when we went away about 11 days and left her w eds sister
5 HR AGO
Ah
5 HR AGO
But she's got grandkids and it seems she and her daughter
5 HR AGO
Just left her in the conservatory which was roasting
5 HR AGO
That might be traumatic.
5 HR AGO
So I think she was just weirded out and scared
5 HR AGO
I know
5 HR AGO
You've heard of Ed's sister. That cunt
5 HR AGO
Ha. I love you. You are the only female I speak with that uses the word "cunt" openly with me.
5 HR AGO
I realize it isn't the same degree of swear word where you live.
5 HR AGO
When we went to get her from there was the first time she peed
5 HR AGO
In fear of transit
5 HR AGO
Plenty folk here hate/dislike /don't use it
5 HR AGO
It's such a gorgeous word though.
5 HR AGO
But aye, it's different culturally
5 HR AGO
Folk in the States act like saying cunt is comparable to raping a senile grandma or something
5 HR AGO
Aye, it's a great word, I'm a fan lol
5 HR AGO
Anyway, she tends to freak about travel, now
5 HR AGO
ROFL =)
5 HR AGO
The cat box is not an option, she'll pish immediately
5 HR AGO
Sounds like drugging her is the only option.
5 HR AGO
But when we came here w the caravan we locked her in the bathroom
5 HR AGO
And she didnae exactly enjoy herself, nae doubt, but she didnae pish
5 HR AGO
And she was settled and fine quite quickly after we arrived
5 HR AGO
So fingers crossed it's OK, again
5 HR AGO
/fingers-crossed
5 HR AGO
Then I've got to take her to our friends house
5 HR AGO
Weds night Prolly, before we're away for a week
5 HR AGO
They're literally a street over so I usually just try to swathe her and just hold her
5 HR AGO
Til we get there
5 HR AGO
So far she's never pissed going there
5 HR AGO
Cats are the best pets.
5 HR AGO
I am not a dog person either (nor am I much of a dog-person person).
5 HR AGO
But she's pished on me twice bringing her back from theirs
5 HR AGO
Cats are great, but Ed's not the biggest fan. He and Tuck are adorable, tho
5 HR AGO
They're good play pals :)
5 HR AGO
She's the only cat he's ever been close to
5 HR AGO
But we"ll never have another
5 HR AGO
If I were rich: https://philosopher.life/#Bobbit%20Worm%20Tank:%5B%5BBobbit%20Worm%20Tank%5D%5D
5 HR AGO
Never another?
5 HR AGO
I don't think [[k0sh3k]] would let me do that.
5 HR AGO
I feel OK w that, for the most part, cannae get better than Tuck
5 HR AGO
Maybe if/when we get properly old
5 HR AGO
WTF is a bobbit worm??
5 HR AGO
Maybe I dinnae want to ken
5 HR AGO
I'm not a fan of slimy Things
5 HR AGO
You are in for a treat!
5 HR AGO
Did you see the jellyfish photos on my site? :)
5 HR AGO

5 HR AGO
Oh, yes, I love jellyfish too. That is something I would like.
5 HR AGO

5 HR AGO
I only saw headline. Not into worms ewwww lol
5 HR AGO
they are far far scarier than worms
5 HR AGO
think the Xenomorph (from Alien, the movie) in a water centipede form
5 HR AGO
they make me not want to go in the ocean
5 HR AGO
named after that woman who cut her husbands penis off with scissors
5 HR AGO
That's what I thought of!!! Her
5 HR AGO
Well thanks for the disgusting terrifying information
5 HR AGO
:grin:
5 HR AGO
I'm out for now lol
5 HR AGO
Hugs to [[k0sh3k]] from me, please!
5 HR AGO
Will do. Take it easy. TTYL.
