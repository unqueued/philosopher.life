title: 2019.08.08 - Afterschool Teaching: Pigs

I'm taking notes with officers around me. Sonya said she has never felt safer. She clearly has family here. She happily explains that mental health first aid originates in Australia because they are famous for their youth mental illness. Sonya is fascinating in how she signals like she's progressive, but it is only a learned foreign language which masks her obvious conservatism. Oh yeah, she's a business owner too (which she loves to talk about).

Of the ground rules for the day, "spelling doesn't count" (and I'm hardly a stickler!). Watching pigs and teachers read, write, and reason was killing me all day. I feel like I'm from another planet. 

Those with mental health disorders are stigmatized and otherized in this room. I only see lipservice paid. There are some mind-boggling attempts by the police officers to justify their attitudes and behaviors toward these people.

Folks are convinced opioids and meth are causing ADHD. The anecdotes do not make sense. Guis, guis, tattoos and piercing are forms of non-suicidal self-harm! As usual, they are certain the causes of all my children's problems boil down to social media, vidja games, uncensored access to the internet, sexual promiscuity, gender deviance, and drug use (with a focus on cheese as a joke). 

Hilariously, Sonya says that she doesn't care what the research says because she has seen differently. Given how much emphasis she places on research (much of which she is pulling out of her ass) in the past couple days, she should probably give an account of this belief. Her contradictions were too much to handle.

Our activities are meaningless, time-wasters, and miss the point. They teach us nothing. It is a way to make us feel like we are participating and provide paperwork and calendar evidence to justify Sonya and her co-worker's positions and behaviors throughout the year. I can tell this is a public school setting. I'm heartbroken by it.

Descriptions of typical adolescents could not have been more condescending and out of touch. The pigs hate youth even when part of them thinks they like the young. The Lt. in charge of the SROs talked with me all day. He called the teenagers "Satan," and he wasn't exactly joking. He was the most eloquent of the bunch. Even the teachers saw him as an epistemic authority.

We were given an anecdote about a crazy man recently on the trail. Sonya felt he should have been imprisoned without due process. Many of the cops didn't think children suffering from mental disorders should be allowed in classes with other students (you should have seen the disgust on their faces as Sonya spoke of cases in my own school). Separately, speaking of an imaginary teenager we were roleplaying about, Lt. said he'd cuff him, beat him, and tell the kid to stop resisting (which I guessed before he said it, and he grinned). It was weird being fist-bumped by the Lt. for defining xenophobia (one activity was an acronym of the alphabet to describe young people, and that was the "X" word chosen which nobody knew the meaning of); I should not have spoken up.

The videos we watched were pure rhetoric. The arguments were incoherent. This was a brainwashing session with some commonsense prescriptions tacked on. It's pretty hard to teach empathy to those who make a living turning off their empathy at will.

Sonya and the Good Ol' Boys (and the demure women) worshipped cops (sickening line after line) and capitalism while doublespeak trashtalking Z and Millennials. They rejoiced in their apostolic (their word) faiths in God. Ingroup circlejerking and nepotism bled from the walls. I was back in church for a day. There wasn't a single educated person among them, let alone a wise and kind one. I am exhausted from having to make inferences all day about these people, especially because I am not allowed to reveal myself at all (safety actually being on the line). It felt like delivering answers tailored to my enemies and paying attention to the room of people so closely could not have been more draining. I'm so tired of giving eye contact today.

It's not like I didn't hunt for [[others]]. I am careful to sift and signal in this 1984-esque scene of [[smalltalk]] and joyous patriotism. I open the door in conversation. How they walk through it gives me a chance to paranoically build trust. There was only one today, and she was not in the group at all. An employee at the Board of Education, Juli, told me her story in 15 minutes with pointed questions. She would not like me, but I hold her work in high regard. She puts clothes on kids' backs, feeds the poor, and finds shelter for the needy. She handles 8 students a month. `/salute`

The cop who left his gun for 5NP2 to pick up was there. He still has his job. The far more dangerous one that sees behind my eyes was there too. I know because I see behind his as well. I can play the language game with everyone else there, but he reads something else. He gives me the willies.

8 hours of hell. I felt like Daniel in the Den.

Oh, Delp sent me messages about work that day and the next (things he should have sent me a week or two in advance). I'll do what I can for him.
