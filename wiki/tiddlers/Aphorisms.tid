title: Aphorisms

//Feel the angst, ennui, and kek of an edgelord. It burns. //


I'm sensitive to these aphorisms, so I keep them here. I am not claiming that I agree to every detail of these quotes (although, for the most part I do). Even in those I disagree with, I think there is something worth exploring.

Aphorisms are a poor-man's philosophy. They are the fortune-cookie messages we treasure. Admittedly, few things can or should be expressed in aphorisms. With that caveat in mind, I think we all adore the precision, wit, and efficiency of aphorisms. They are snappy, powerful shortcuts in our reality maps. I think they are useful to collect and reflect upon as well. They aren't meant to be dogmatic mantras, but instead rules-of-thumb with which we test ourselves and the world. 

For the record (lol), I don't give a shit about attribution. None of these quotes are mine, so don't feel like I'm lying or plagiarizing (that would be absurd). Also, my categorization is oversimplified and has much overlap, but it does a good enough job.
