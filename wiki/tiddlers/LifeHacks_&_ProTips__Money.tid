title: LifeHacks & ProTips: Money

Careers

* Employers put "entry level" in job titles to trick applicants into accepting less pay. If the "entry level" job requires you to have significant experience, demand more than starting pay.
* 50% of a job is just being friendly to the right people.
* Cultivate good working relationships with your authorities, superiors, etc. for access to their networks, favors, etc.
* When drinking with your boss or manager, always stay at least one drink behind them.

Personal Finances:

* Almost everyone who is 'good with money' shares a common trait: they make a detailed budget for the next month and stick to it.
** Continue down that path. You can do actual accounting for yourself, so do it. Account for yourself. Be accountable to yourself.

Investing/Spending: 

* If you want a PS4/Xbox One on the cheap, check Craigslist/eBay around the time that semester report cards come out.

Debt:

* Have an old student loan on your credit report and are trying to fix your credit? Check to see if that company is still in business. If you send a proof of debt request to the company, they have 30 days to respond to your request. If they do not, it will be removed from your credit report.
** You will need to track the request to show you sent a request as proof, either through a credit website that has their address that you can send a request through, or an online dispute option though one of the major credit checked companies (Equifax, TransUnion, etc)
* With $200 you can file for bankruptcy in Hawaii. Just get all of the bill collectors to send you a recent bill, go to the courthouse, voila.
