Dear [[R]],

I know it has been almost two weeks since you sent your last letter. I want you to know I've not been avoiding responding; I've been working hard on a response. The reason for the delay: I've been thinking quite a bit and dealing with other issues. My parents came to visit last week. I was very anxious, to say the least. I wanted to make sure I did not offend them while still being myself and honest (this is not easy to do). More painfully though, I found out my mother's thyroid problem is destroying her kidneys (my fear has been confirmed). I think she will die of renal failure; she is convinced as well (they are walking through her bucketlist). Steroids and dialysis have serious limitations for her. I have wept many times over the past week.

My mother is a classic boomer workaholic by choice (even she agrees). She has sacrificed her basic health (and arguably many things and people in her life) for her ministry. She has been consumed by vocational zeal to the point of lacking empathy for herself and family (classic PK/MK problems arise). Have you ever read 'The Poisonwood Bible,' and what did you think of it? It has been difficult to see and accept that her hard way of life joined with the stress that I have caused her (among many others) has led to her pending death.

I hope her remaining year(s) is/are peaceful. Whatever strongly mixed feelings I have about my mother (and vice versa), I want her to be happy. I want to be empathic and kind toward her. I love her. It's part of who I am. It's part of being unified. I hope with time and wisdom, I will see her narrative with more charity (which, admittedly, is hard to do when it isn't reciprocated during times of crisis [when I need it most]). I want to have a good relationship with my mom. It kills me that we don't. We are a house divided by the truth.

My mother and I talked this past Monday for a couple hours. We cried. We talked, carefully couched, about our plans, our analyses of who we are and how we fit, and our existential points of view. We are trying to find common ground, but it is obvious we will fail. We will always stand on thin ice with each other. Knowing it very well could be the conversation I have with her in person, I told her what she meant to me, how grateful I am, that I love her. It was bittersweet since every word was inevitably coated and coded with the meanings of our suffering and conflict. I tried to scrape it off, but we both know how damaged we and our words are. We both understand each other (and ourselves) and yet don't in crucial ways. Our bifurcated relationship is not how life is meant to be. The scar is already there, and she hasn't even died yet.

They have the kids for the week. I have stipulated before that my parents are not permitted to evangelize to my children. This is not out of spite. Of course, I want my children to have a good relationship with their grandparents. Problematically, my parents are skilled rhetoricians who sincerely love God in their broken way, and by His command love other people as well, but they do not pursue the truth. Unfortunately, they are incredibly talented manipulators. I respect their work with the poor, but not their methods, reasons, and the costs they've incurred. Of course, the result is that they don't get to share a part of themselves with my children (although, whether purposely or not, it stills oozes out).

I see the paths they could have taken and did not. Even they agree that I know them better than anyone else on the planet. As harsh as it sounds: it is clear that after raising 3 suicidal sons so deeply unprepared for the world that they aren't good parents. My parents had the means to be good parents, but not the will. They should have followed Paul's advice and not have had children in the first place while pouring themselves into their ministry. And, yet, I have to move past my judgment. I'm a failure too. Judgment must be withheld as a matter of practical wisdom. Judgment destroys us. I have been inspecting the concept of "Doing Our Best" yet again. I at least partially know how little I know. We must build together a new house while we still can.

I'm going to ask my brothers to throw a party at my brother [[JRE]]'s house for the family. My youngest brother, [[AIR]], can't even be in the same room with them (I see why; my parents often lack empathy for him). But, I think he will feel safe at JRE's house (but not my parents'). A last hurrah and a celebration of my mother's life would be nice. If she does die soon, I want us to part on amicable terms.

What kind of relationship did you have with your parents? What do you regret? What did you do right? Does it ever get easier?

I will only mention the tip of your letter for now: As we age, do we become worldworn? What is the source of tiredness? Is your tiredness like that of others? How, and why?

Love,
