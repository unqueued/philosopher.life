!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** I asked you to shed your privacy curtains because you are sharing the T.V. and Xbox (on your side of the room) with your sister. You were kind and understanding about it. I appreciate that you see the sense in it, and that even though you prefer it dark, you were willing to give it up.
** I'm glad you use your time outside to make connections with people.
** Your python program for isograms was neat.
* j3d1h
** I really appreciate that you are willing to switch gears on subjects so often. Your mom got a new book on math, and we immediately paused your progress in the other two books to focus on this one. We had the temporary project shift from Rust to Python. Your writing and deep reading are in constant flux. You do a good job going with the flow and making do with the problems at hand. Thank you.
** Thank you for drawing characters for me.
** You did a good job getting the X-box controllers and involving your brother in it.
* k0sh3k
** You have been very forgiving of me in my attempts to find a job. I want to say thank you for being gracious. 
** Thank you for the tea today, even though you had already made tea for yourself.
** Thank you for pushing us to do the laundry.
* h0p3
