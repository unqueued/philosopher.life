title: Gaming Microcosms & Personal Narratives

Over the years, I have argued for the value of gaming. One recurring theme in my arguments is that games, especially MMORPG's, provide a digital playground and life-similar microcosm. There's work to be done, places, things to do, tools, objectives, economies, factions, guilds, social circles, groups, world-events, scripts, mechanics, metagaming, and so many other aspects which create little worlds for us to explore and interact with. We create narratives while we game, and these narratives can be of value to us IRL.

I have long found the Narrativist approach to gaming misguided. I was a pure Ludologist. But, I realize that ludology and narrative cannot be peeled apart. They are woven together. To be clear, I'm not talking about the pulpy storyline of the game itself (it does nothing for me, but that is fairly natural given my context). 

There is IRL value to be found in the digital personal narratives we generate inside the microcosms of games. It allows us to understand ourselves and others in weird ways. Game theory is all about the simplification. There is an unscientific kind of narrative to appreciate though. This is what I mean by useful digital personal narratives. We get to stand back as a 3rd party, as an outsider, as a partially detached agent controlling a character. This enables a special kind of dissociated feedback loop ripe for inspection and reflection.

We might ask ourselves something like: How does the way I play this game demonstrate who I really am? It is the thing which Westworld is talking about. It is the nature of Experience Machines, the Veils of Ignorance, and the Rings of Gyges that we come to know our authentic selves. Gaming microcosms are the existential mirrors we can gaze into.

So...let's do some analysis. I should walk through my games. I'll start with World of Warcraft:

I was the best rogue on two servers, and very respectable (from a ludological standpoint) on all classes. I was very wealthy; if it could be bought, I owned it. I botted my characters (so much fun) and gold, removing the grind, and spent my time thinking about the game and PvPing. I did not socialize in the way other people did (and even WoW players are generally considered to be poor socializers themselves IRL). I utterly failed to connect with most people. I was honestly world-class at the game, and I did it in unexpected ways. I had a very deep knowledge of its design, flaws, and the rich set of interactions in the game. I very rarely lost, and even the members of top guilds on my servers lost in combat to me, even though I had a quarter of the gear they had. I used to throw pure green items on my warlock and still destroy full raid gear players; sometimes I fought naked to show-off. I was a Gladiator. Seriously, I was amazing at the game.<<ref "1">>

I want to understand why I was amazing at the game, a game in which many people played 8-12 hours a day for years like a full-time job.

I'm a loner in games. I do not climb social ladders. I have very few (yet close) friends. I understand the world better
