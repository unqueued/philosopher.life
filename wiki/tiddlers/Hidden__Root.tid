Welcome to the home of the hidden subwiki easter egg embedded in h0p3's Wiki.<<ref "o">> I'll agree it's not very hidden at all, but it's not meant to be something nobody finds.<<ref "1">> It marginally limits the exposure of some PII, but more importantly, it's meant to be a place that people don't have to see unless they really want to. Access to the contents of this directory is fairly open across the wiki, and there are many ways to find your way here. 

I think a stealth mechanic makes the most sensitive and easily doxxable personal information just a tad harder to find. I'm under no illusions of privacy or anonymity here, as I've expressed many times. Despite that fact, this is a non-trivial security through obscurity defense against cursory/surface trolls. Obviously, you can find it in seconds if you know to look for it. 

Additionally, I think the hidden subwiki enables the customarily visible wiki more palatable to the faint of heart. Of course, not everyone loves my penis as much as I do,<<ref "l">> and this is a slight curb of sanity and polite gesture owing to the fact that I'm autistically "too honest." I also think this is more fun, making the rabbithole more thought-provoking and tittilating.

This is a non-trivial house of my {[[Dreams]]}. That's actually why it is literally hidden in that top-level directory. Please note that most of these are mere dreams, impractical and fantastical. They are not to be taken seriously.<<ref "p">> 

Obviously, in the eyes of the average person, these are odd or TMI personal even as mere thoughts to ever say outloud, let alone post publicly. Normally, I'd say the same thing, but {[[About]]} and {[[Principles]]} are absurdly clear about the fact that I have to shape my identity in the sunlight, even in my dreams.

!! Principles:

* Only Hidden Wiki pages should use the prefix "Hidden:" or the Hidden tag.
* The //Hidden:// [[titletag]] prefix will supersede all others.
* Don't force everyone to reckon with your sexual interests or terrible ideas.
* Make PII and related just a hair more difficult to access by keeping some of it here.

!! Dreams:

* I wonder if I should consider storing encrypted information here. Ugh. That might defeat the purpose of the wiki in some respects, but that would also be some serious trust (even for just personal information). Perhaps the best option would be to embed TC-type containers instead? I'll say this, for a number of reasons, mounting those containers is the wildly more secure option.
