title: Love, Death & Robots

Sound and graphics hover between cheese and amazing. Reminds me of several pieces of animation. Thrilling blow'em up action. Tits, can't get enough of em. Pulp and gore. The story is interesting. I feel like a kid again.

We have fun guessing what the symbols foreshadow.

It's hilarious. The preaching is still off; it doesn't target capitalism well enough (and, I suspect by design). Punk dystopia is alive and well. The show is has lots of emptiness in it.

The show is gratuitous, too serious about itself, cliche, and corny; they do it on purpose too, so the irony makes it cool again (right? :P). It's a highlight reel of vidya game cutscenes.

Lots of looping. It's a bit too predictable, but I think the kids are absolutely mesmerized. I'm glad we have something to share here.
