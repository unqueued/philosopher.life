*** I didn't realize this argument existed in the 40's. Wow! They saw very far ahead.

*** I think that is fascinating. Subverting our rewards system that hard. I can see nefarious uses for this as well. Hello, Huxley! Still, I'd love to take a hit on that.

*** Holy fuck! Literal slavery people, that is the tip of the iceberg.

*** Unfortunately, you have no idea what you are saying in your rejection of essentialism. Learn not to strawman it. Your "cluster of homeostatic properties" must ultimately be specified on essentialist grounds. This is philosophically inescapable. You make excellent arguments though, and you are pushing in the right direction. Again, you still do not understand how to build complex rules for achieving eudaimonia in all contexts. I applaud your move; you still aren't there.

*** I'm not an incel, but I see their plight. Fuck you. Yes, there is insanity in there. There is also something deeply correct there as well. You are squashing people who have been trampled on their entire lives. SJW's should actually see the thread in there that is correct. Remember: cede the common ground first and then correct. You have not done that.

** https://splinternews.com/unfuckable-women-dont-go-on-killing-sprees-1825746733
*** Many correct points. Unfortunately, I don't think you've painted the comparison fairly. You need to swallow the redpill to see the difference.

** https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/8gzs0q/but_islam_isnt_a_race_starter_pack/
*** Yikes. This is where they go wrong. Unfortunately, culturalism is inescapable if you aren't a relativist. There are scientists and philosophers on that starter pack who have no business being ridiculed. Unfortunately, there is something right about the "cultural marxist" claim levied against many Leftists. I can't defend you guys here; sorry, bro. =/

*** Reminds me of my male donor. Whenever I had a problem with POTUS over the past 2 decades, he'd resort to "respect the office." Go KYS, asshole.

* Fishy
** https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21741531-his-bicentenary-marxs-diagnosis-capitalisms-flaws-surprisingly-relevant-rulers
*** They truly do not want to paint the picture accurately. There are schizophrenically incompatible arguments in this piece. 
*** This is a desperate attempt to smear socialism, to prevent a public narrative from realizing it and doing something about it.
*** Let's be clear: "Confront" in this case means to subvert and enslave more effectively. This piece is about making sure rulers understand how far they are going to need to go to prevent successful insurrection. This piece is not meant to help the masses.
