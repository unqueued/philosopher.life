Hello John,

I'm h0p3. It's nice to meet you. If this message is inappropriately "out of the blue" for you, I apologize.

I too have a big-picture fetish. You write very clearly on the topic, and I admire that. We seem to have a great deal in common. I'm turning 33 soon, I have two children, and I'm interested in a fairly broad set of topics, imho. I'm reading through your work and enjoying it. I can't say my writing is as clean as yours, but I work hard on it: https://philosopher.life/

Anyways, this letter is just a shot in the dark; it's worth my time to reach out and try to start a dialogue with you. I don't meet enough people who think like you do.

Sincerely,

h0p3
