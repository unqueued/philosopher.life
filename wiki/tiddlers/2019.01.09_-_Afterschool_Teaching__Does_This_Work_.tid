title: 2019.01.09 - Afterschool Teaching: Does This Work?

Immediately had to call Kathy to fax my physical to Sonya. I don't know why she didn't do that herself. I assume there is a trust or laziness issue here. Delp is here and wants me. Glad he defends me here.

Nothing to do after, and I like that.

The snack lady may show up to grade us. I need to know my student count for her.

I circled, listened, fielded questions. I checked to see who had homework. 5NP made a mess on purpose. I realize the kid is new and likely acting out for some excellent reasons in life. He's obviously intelligent. I'm setting reasonable groundrules. He'll figure out that playing by my rules will be the highest utility option (or so I hope).

I took the 5th and 6th grades to Stout's room. I play divide and conquer to settle them into productive and difficult to interrupt environments. 5LL is being a little shit. Into the corner with you, feller. I eventually broke him and we solved two fraction problems. I'm going to continue to grind until he gets it. He can obviously do it if he elects to focus and neatly write it out.

It's true: the boys are the hardest to deal with, but this is likely due to social conditioning in no small part. 6DM and I are fine now. I had him create some art, and we talked about like we were fancy gentlemen. 

5JR wasn't so bad, especially since I used my highschool volunteers to handle some of the boys that appeared to be interested in working alone. I'm herding cats here. 

Eventually some kids went and solved a puzzle. 5CC is a sweetheart. She is perhaps my favorite of the group. She's kind, does her best, and I can trust her. I always ask her first if their group has any homework.

We sat in the computer lab. I only remind the children that they may cause us to lose our privileges in this wonderful place. I'm trying to be ridiculously lenient on tech here. They aren't allowed to have phones at all, but I just want to make sure they don't disturb those working on schoolwork and don't damage their ears by having music pumping too loudly out of their earbuds (I feel old).

Btw, my folding/collapsible keyboard is AMAZING! It's a hard keyboard, no slip, chiclet (gross), and it has function/mediaish keys too. Considering it folds up to be the size of my phone, I'm cumming rainbows. My phone case folds out to stand (on top of being indestructible). I basically have a ghetto laptop on a shitty machine and evil OS on the go.

By the end of the day, Matt was concerned that one of the students was doing something inappropriate on the computers. He asked me to look through the browser history (because he doesn't know how!). I'm glad to see he found nothing. =)
