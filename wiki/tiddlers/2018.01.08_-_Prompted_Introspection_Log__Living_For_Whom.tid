title: 2018.01.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: Living For Whom

!! Who do you live for?

My family. I must admit, without them, the only thing I left to live for is [[h0p3]] itself. That is not nothing, but it's also kind of weak without a family to sit around the fire. I don't know how others do it. It must be incredibly lonely. 

Let me say this, I want to strengthen my resolve to find my life worth living even if I didn't have a family; it is not a healthy enough outlook otherwise. Sometimes I fall into a pattern that misses the boat. 

Do I need to take DCK? I fear my answer isn't good enough. The thought of not having my family is hard to bear; it's too much pain to empathize with that hypothetical person. 

Ugh. I can't sweep this under the rug. The Stoics have something valuable to say here. I must harden my fragility. I have to face the vulnerability music facts, continually own up to our mortality, and hug them like there is no tomorrow because there might not be one. This isn't quite living like they are dead, but it is has a touch of it. It is not in my power. I can only enjoy the fleeting meaning in our cosmos, as it were, yo. Enjoy!
