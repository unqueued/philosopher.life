title: 2017.11.09 - Carpe Diem Log: Southpark

* Awoke at 4:30. My stomach felt bad. It quickly devolved into what felt like food poisoning. 
** Kratom-like. I lay on my belly and shat into the air. It was a mess, but it was the only way to deal with the pain.
** I don't think I have the bug that is going around, although our my wife has definitely felt sick this past week. We did have our flu shots, but I have my doubts.
** I'm exhausted, but I feel better. We do not know the cause.

* Southpark opened a big discussion with the kids this morning. We talked about the Overton window, horseshoe and fish-hook theories, the false compromises to the Right, and a wide variety of political and epistemic considerations.
