title: 2014.04.02 - Dignity and Respect: Respect for Animals

I have many small points of disagreement with Korsgaard throughout the paper, but overall, I like some of the major moves she makes. I don’t think my small disagreements can’t be handled though, so I don’t think they are important enough to voice.

Korsgaard is an eminent Kant scholar. I hesitate to disagree with her about what Kant means (I am not an expert), but I worry she sometimes embeds some of her own thinking in the exegesis (which is not what good exegesis is like). I’m worried about her explanation of Kant’s views on the relationship between the Good and the Right.

Anyways, she seems to be calling into the question the specialness of rights-bearers. Why must we think being a rights-bearer is so special? It seems obvious to me that being a duty-bearer is special (it requires freedom), but being a rights-bearer not so much. The ability to demand that an obligation be filled is NOT a legitimate requirement of being a rights-bearer. Again, the right-bearer need not claim or demand; he has it even in silence; we are obligated by the law itself. It is the moral law which has the first claim on us, and all other claims spring from it.

“Morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in itself, since only through this is it possible to be a lawgiving member in the Kingdom of Ends.” It depends on what is meant by this. If it means that only a being which is a moral being, one capable of having duties, is an end in itself, then I worry it isn’t true. In some ways, this class has shown that the discussion of “ends” is just murky language. It does not say anything substantial to me. I want it to mean something more than “be moral,” but I don’t see it.

I have a serious problem with the idea we “we confer normative significance” on anything. That isn’t an objective law. I don’t think we are talking about morality anymore when we decide what is right.

---



“for whom” things can be good or bad” (92) This is natural good (92). Good and bad in the “objective” or “normative” sense. (let’s see if she fulfills that). Why should that cause us to ask “how should we treat others?” (92)

Kick dogs, skinning cats…trivial reasons to harm animals. Experiments for learning, making useful products from them, eating them, preventing them from intereferring with our other human ends (gardening/farming, pests).

Differences may result in how we think about the good, and in how we think about the right. (93)

Argue that Kant’s theory demonstrates that we have duties to non-human animals, even if they can’t recriprocate. (93)

Maybe. I’m not against having duties toward things, and them having rights. I think it is really special to be the kind of thing which has a moral duty (you need freedom for that). To be a right-bearer, however, it isn’t clear you need to be free at all. Hell, I think I have duty to things which don’t exist yet (my grandchildren’s generation and so on).

Pain and pleasure are the markers of good and bad for*? (93-94). Seems short-sighted. I think there is a good of a desk, perhaps. A standard of the good of a desk. What is fitting!

Why the concentration on “experience?” Utilitarian locations, happen, but not “for whom” experiences are good or bad…odd. (94)

Bashing Utility. So hard.

Rejecting aggregation. (95-96)

Why should I buy this tethering argument? What exactly is going on here?

Why is it a mistake the characterize Kantian deontology as accepting a “side-constraint” on the promotion of the good? (98) “Kantdoes not believe there is some general duty to maximize or even promote the goodthat is then limited by certain deontological restrictions. Rather, he believes thatpromoting the good of another and treating her justly and honestly are two aspects of respecting her as an end in herself.” Explain to me how that is different exactly?

Why should we treat animals as ends in themselves? Is that really the argument here?

The relevantquestion is rather what, given their nature and ours, each of us can do in order to berelated as well as possible to each of them. (98)…

Nonhuman animals are “analogues” of humanity, and that we therefore “cultivate our duties to humanity” when we practice duties to animals as “analogues” of human beings. (100)

“anyone who thinks we do not have duties to the other animals must think there is a morally relevant difference between us and them. Kant thought

that difference is that we are rational and therefore moral animals, and the other animals are not.” (100-101). Easy to hold Kant’s claim that we are moral animals and non-human animals aren’t, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have duties toward them.

The skeptic is always in a position to doubt the consciousness of others. Why would we agree to there being other minds? We won’t have certainty in this matter. (101). Arguing for degrees of self-consciousness, and seems difficult to test.

“But once you are aware of the influence of a potential ground of action, as we human beings are, you are in a position to decide whether to allow yourself to be influenced in that way or not.” (102) Why should I agree to this? That is far from obvious. Just because you have “a certain reflective distance from the impulse that is influencing you” neither necessarily means “you are in a position to ask yourself, ‘but should I be influenced in that way?’” (unless we are just begging the question with “certain” here) nor does it necessitate that you can decide about the matter. She is making phenomenological leaps. Awareness of our reasons for acting is one capacity, the ability to ask normative questions (rather than merely reflect) about this awareness is another, and freedom as a capacity is distinctly another. Her overall point though, about there being a difference between humans and non-human animals may still stand.

“Morality does not rest simply in being altruistic or cooperative, although it certainly does demand those things. It rests in being altruistic or cooperative or honest or fair or respectful because you think you should be: because, that is, you yourself would will that everyone should act in those ways.” (103) I just don’t buy this claim. I still don’t see the moral law as being dependent upon me or anyone else.

“Of course, what most obviously follows from that is not that we have no duties to the other animals. Rather, what most obviously follows is that they have no duties to us. So now we must ask why Kant thought that their lack of moral agency disqualifies the other animals from being regarded as ends in themselves” (103) This is a great point. I think she is right about that.

reciprocity argument (104)

Rights of the paintings. (104) In an ordinary language sense, we would never say a painting could have a right not to be destroyed. We are doing metaethics though (far from ordinary, imho), and that means we get to set aside ordinary language arguments many times. Why must we think being a rights-bearer is so special? It seems obvious to me that being a duty-bearer is special (it requires freedom), but being a rights-bearer not so much. The ability to demand that an obligation be filled is NOT a legitimate requirement of being a rights-bearer (coma patients, young children, future generations, the unborn, etc.). Paintings might have rights, there isn’t necessarily anything phenomenologically, metaphysically, or metaethically special about a rights-bearer. There has to be something special about a duty-bearer.

“Nor is it enough to add that you are the kind of creature to whom things can be owed.Rather, for me to be obligated to you, we must both be under the authority of the same laws, in the name of which we can make claims on each other.” (104) Seems like a horrible move. I don’t see why I should agree to it.

The Christian/Muslim example is pretty awful. I worry it shows her ignorance of these religions, theologies, and the rich philosophical options available. I’m not even religious, and I’m blown away by this strawman.

“We have autonomy when the laws we are under are laws that we make for ourselves.” A feel-good line of false empowerment.

“Kant believes that insofar as we are rational, we will pursue an end only if we take it to be what I earlier called “objectively” or “normatively” good—something that there is reason to pursue.” (105) Really? I take Kant to be after objective right, first and foremost, rather than good. Maybe the right is grounded in the good though, I don’t know.

Korsgaard is an eminent Kant scholar. I hesitate to disagree with her about what Kant means (I am not an expert), but I worry she sometimes embeds some of her own thinking in the exegesis (which is not what good exegesis is like). That may not change the argument though.

“Morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in itself, since only through this is it possible to be a lawgiving member in the Kingdom of Ends.” I’ve decided that this is just the discussion of “ends” is just murky language. It does not say anything substantial to me. I want it to mean something more than “be moral,” but I don’t see it.

Good summary at 106-107.

“The question is whether that is really the only way in which one being can have an obligation to another.” (107)

“some law protects his interests by giving him a right, and as the right-holder he makes a claim on us.” (107) Again, the right-bearer need not claim or demand; he has it even in silence; we are obligated by the law itself. It is the moral law which has the first claim on us, and all other claims spring from it.

Just because we subjectively see ourselves as having good and bad things for us doesn’t mean we are correct that objectively we do. Just because we see ourselves, personally as having this doesn’t mean we must see everyone else as having that, including animals. Because I see myself in a certain way, I must see animals in a certain way? I’m not sure if this is true.

We make claims on ourselves on their behalf. I strictly disagree with the claim that “we confer normative significance” on anything. If we made the moral law, then I don’t believe it is normative.
