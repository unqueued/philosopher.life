I'm tired of paying for your mistakes, especially when you don't recognize it.

You only support my happiness insofar as it leads to your happiness, to verifying your point of view, to seeking your approval, and essentially, only insofar as it is existentially convenient for you. 

You have fundamentally misunderstood in the non-Hanlonian sense the moral features of our relationship. That I do not have to forgive you for.

Prayer to God or Jesus or whoever works because it requires people to be existentially open in those moments. Essentially, those people are meditating, especially when it hurts. They are taking the time to listen to themselves, ignorantly pretending a part of them (their imagination) is the divine. They listen to that part of themselves (whether they know it is part of themselves or not) they feel is divine. It like causes some people to empathize with themselves, providing serious utility, and reinforcing their belief in the divine. When confronted, they are unwilling to consider the possibility this is the best explanation, instead, they will confabulate to maintain their identity embedded in these memories as a flight mechanism. Again, please recall that appearances are deceiving.

My friend, MB, has now told me twice that I don't have any wasted words on my wiki (she is trying to give me a compliment, and that's the one she chooses). What does she mean by that? That's a weird thing to say, right? Sometimes I do say it in as few words as possible. My writing is not that good, so does she mean I've not said enough?

Daoism was interesting to me because it was a backdoor to Stoicism again.
