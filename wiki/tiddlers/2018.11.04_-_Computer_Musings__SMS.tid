title: 2018.11.04 - Computer Musings: SMS

I'm speaking with [[GB]] over SMS. ~~I think he's not interested in using anything else. That sucks, but I'll do whatever I can here.~~ Hangouts works for him (still, not my preference). No SMS syncing options are decent. Back to AirDroid. I'm pretty disgusted by it, but this is not up to me.

How the fuck is this problem not solved? The costs of NATing makes us all second-class citizens on the interwebs. P2P is a fucking hack at this point.

Also, git is blowing 2GB and far too much CPU. Lol. I think [[j3d1h]] is wrong about our directory choice.
