title: 2018.08.29 - BAGD: Culturism

To claim that one culture is better than another is extremely unpopular. We have the usual [[gfwiwcgws]] problem. We have to contextualize and understand perspective and relativize to the resources and circumstances at hand. Memetic fitness in evolution, of course, doesn't give it prescriptive powers without violating the 'is/ought'.

I think there are real epistemic advantages. There are some memes which are legitimately better than others. I beg the culturalist question. The flower in the desert can't be held accountable to flourish to the same [[dok]] as the flower in the lush meadow. This is not an issue of responsibility. We're talking about the [[The Good]] and not [[The Right]] (at least not directly thus far).

Canonical narratives can be wielded as patriarchy. That doesn't mean there aren't some bodies of literature which aren't better than others, particularly after we resolve contextualist problems.

I think a culture that doesn't have [[The Golden Rule]] in its memeplex is inferior to a culture that does tout court.

Also: [[2018.08.29 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle]] discussed. I can't write and talk at the time effectively, so most of what we talked about didn't make it in.
