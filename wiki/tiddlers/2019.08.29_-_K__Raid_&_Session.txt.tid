You ever hear back about the position you applied for at the library?
AUG 29 11:55 AM
Didn’t get it. :( they gave it to someone with experience.
AUG 29 11:56 AM
She’s nice I guess? She stole my chair so I stole it back
AUG 29 11:56 AM
Ah, I got sidetracked. My boss' boss can't open a 7zip file, which is, of course, my fault.
AUG 29 11:56 AM
I'm sorry =(
AUG 29 11:56 AM
I'm glad you got your chair back though, lol
AUG 29 11:57 AM
I'm doing my usual. Trying to get my children to do their best.
AUG 29 11:57 AM

Yikes. Those aren’t hard to open!
AUG 29 11:57 AM
Me too. ;)

This woman is in charge of every teacher in the county.

Painfully arrogant woman, lol.
AUG 29 11:58 AM
She sounds exhausting.

Hahaha

Aye, lol
AUG 29 11:58 AM
TGIF, homie. What are your plans?
AUG 30 1:41 PM
Hey [[h0p3]]! Running a session and a one shot tomorrow and Monday respectively. In between that I plan to read and write. :)
AUG 30 2:23 PM
What about you guys?
AUG 30 2:23 PM
Grinding away. Reading and writing. Slowly finishing letters off. I'm taking way longer than I should. The vidja game addiction is strong.
AUG 30 4:54 PM
The usual grind for us. Clean the house, family time, and whatever fun my offspring choose to have.
