Have a great day today! ^_^
WED 8:48 AM
^_^ You too!
WED 8:49 AM
2 Papers and Test left. What will you be tackling today?
WED 8:51 AM
Home stretch for Taoism. One of my friends takes issue with how I represented Buddhism, but I agree with him. I could have said a lot more about it but I just don’t have the space in the paper....
WED 8:52 AM
Gotta watch Frozen too before my exam on Friday.
WED 8:52 AM
TLDR: Buddhism does have a ton of positive aspects, but none of them are relevant to a Taoist reading of this book. Haha
WED 8:53 AM
I'm not convinced you are correct about Taoism either, but I'm a complete asshole on the topic, lol! I'm not convinced your claims about Buddhism aren't fairly accurate; you simply don't enough space in that paper (you never do!); you might footnote and caveat your way (just like you've done in your TLDR here). I think you have a defensible point of view though. More citation about the belief structures might be worth your time.
WED 8:56 AM
Maybe. I just didn’t have enough time on this paper that I wanted. I’ve been too busy juggling my other classes and I regret this paper not getting the full attention it deserved.
WED 8:56 AM
It is what it is! Maybe I can revisit the topic another day.
WED 8:57 AM
I think you can leave it as is.]
WED 8:57 AM
I would. Lol.
WED 8:57 AM
Thanks for looking at it. 

Yeah. Haha. I have too many other things that need my attention more than a paper that is probably already a B+/A
WED 8:57 AM
What are you up to today?
WED 8:58 AM
Yup. Triage. It's good and good enough.
WED 8:58 AM
School with the kiddos. I have them engaged in the same [[Core Daily Requirements]] again. It's easier this time around.
WED 8:58 AM
They are reading //Sophie's World//, and that has been amazing.
WED 8:59 AM
Trying something new with them. I send them outside to play (lawd knows they don't get enough physical activity, and that's my fault), but now I'm trying to get them to explore further and further away from the house, including the woods.
WED 9:01 AM
Phones have GPS, and full charges are always required.
WED 9:02 AM
[[j3d1h]] has decided to drop her higher level math and drop down to grinding for mastery through Khan because she was disappointed a test she took. I like that she is iterating over concepts. It's a good move.
WED 9:03 AM
All of that sounds great! I appreciate the freedom you are giving with their exploring too. I think that’s a nice touch. With the phones of course!
WED 9:04 AM
Yeah [[j3d1h]] is smart, there’s nothing wrong with taking a step back
WED 9:04 AM
[[1uxb0x]] is studying history a lot more, and I'm hoping that will be his "thing" in our family. I keep trying to find it with him (cause he feels like he doesn't have anything that is really his own, but he's the youngest).
WED 9:04 AM
Other than that, I'm reading+writing, doing my work. Work has been interesting in that I'm answering questions that would probably get me fired.
WED 9:06 AM

WED 9:07 AM
[[1uxb0x]] is a sweet boy. I bet he’ll love history.
WED 9:48 AM
Oh no! Don’t get fired.
WED 9:48 AM
I owe my students the truth as best I can tell it. It's what I'd want for my own children if they were locked in that prison.
WED 9:50 AM
I feel it dude. Haha.
