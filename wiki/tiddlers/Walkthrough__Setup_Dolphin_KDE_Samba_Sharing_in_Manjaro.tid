title: Walkthrough: Setup Dolphin/KDE Samba Sharing in Manjaro

I'm only using Samba to share read-only files to Kodi. I prefer SSH/SFTP for manipulating the filesystem. 

You'll need Samba and kdenetwork-filesharing installed. If you are using Manjaro, this is already done for you.

1. Create `/etc/samba/samba.conf` and paste the following into it:

```
[global]
usershare allow guests = true
usershare max shares =  100
usershare owner only = true
usershare path = /var/lib/samba/shares
```

2. Execute the following:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/shares
sudo groupadd shares
sudo gpasswd -a $USER shares
sudo chown root.shares /var/lib/samba/shares
sudo chmod 1770 /var/lib/samba/shares
sudo systemctl enable smbd nmbd
sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd
```

3. Logout and Login.

4. Open Dolphin, Right-Click on Directory, Properties, Sharing, Share Tab, Enable Share with Samba, and Setup your "Share Settings."

5. I'm using "Allow Guests" with Everyone set to "read only" for simple access.
