It's not so easy to peel apart incentivization and disincentivization. If your ability to survive rests upon "consenting" to being slotted into capitalism, the "positive" incentivization often is in virtue of corresponding disincentives. Costs are paid. It seems pretty obvious to me that immoral incentives and disincentives are fundamental to perfect competition. Those who do not play by the moral rules will eventually have a competitive advantage. There are massive incentives to slavery; it's lucrative to the capitalist. I suggest Rand's definition of "men" or "human" here is narrowly defined as a capitalist willing to become a god at any moral cost.

She does see her realpolitik work as fundamentally concerned with inspiring fear in others to disincentivize criticism of capitalism. She's talented at generating false dichotomies and false compromises in her rhetoric. I'm more than willing to write in black and white (with some green footnotes and blue links). Rand is evil in how she engages in black and white thinking.

Most importantly, I'm wholly unwilling to peel economic and political power apart. Money buys the time and means of others. Money is a type of power, and disinfecting politics is impossible if you aren't shooting to do so from the ground up. Decentralizing power in the material dialectics must happen with all forms of power. She knows this, of course, but the truth is irrelevant to her work.
