title: Residual Christianity

//I dedicate this page to my brothers. I wish I could take away their pain. I wish I could give them an answer. I wish I could give their lives meaning and hope. We cower together. Bind us together. I love you both.//

I have long been on a mission to understand the heart of Christianity. How can I practice what is right if I don't know what is right? 

<<<
[[RPIN]]: It's more fun if you say this next part through clenched teeth like a gritty Mel Gibson Highlander, pointing his sword at his mortal enemy, screaming out: 

"Praxis and Doxa!!!! I swear upon my very being that I will weld you fucking assholes together if it the last thing I ever do GOD DAMNIT!!!! I categorically exist for the sole purpose of being morally justified."

Doesn't that give you the warm fuzzies? Isn't that exactly what God wants from each of us? The reason to follow God is because it is the right thing to do. Thus, //being moral// is the most fundamental principle. But, when we follow that principle, the ZEROTH COMMANDMENT, standard Christianity falls apart.
<<<

Yeah. I was screwed from the very beginning (and I still may be, but I have to try, eh?). 

I needed to justify my faith; it is what the truly faithful must do. Wrestling with God is fundamental to faith. Believe me, my charity has been immense (sane people who value themselves at all would have turned away from Christianity eons before I did). I have charitably stripped this religion down to its bare core as best I could. I disentangled and confabulated my way through more inconsistent strands, hypocrisies, paradoxes, and insanities of Christianity than anyone I've ever met. In my desperate, existential, obsessive, Straussian deconstruction of Christianity, I have repeatedly and begrudgingly, with weeping and gnashing of teeth, given up what was once sacrosanct to me, bit by bit,  in order  to preserve my faith. 

<<<
[[RPIN]]: Ha, we were a whore for God. That non-existent bastard sure fucked us. No, no, wait...wait...it's coming to me...It wasn't //God //that fucked us: it was// the history of the stupidity of humanity, including yourself// that fucked us. So...good job.
<<<

Without going through the grueling details of the chronology, I came to a point where I simultaneously identified as Christian even while one-by-one accepting the losses of: prayer, miracles, heaven and hell, the spiritual dimension, the existence of the Holy Spirit, //Sola scriptura//, //Sola gratia//, //Solus Christus//, the divinity of Christ,  //Soli Deo gloria//, and even Theism (in favor of a Patricentric Transcendental Deism).<<ref "1">>

<<<
[[RPIN]]: The untestable hypothesis (to put it as charitably as possible) of God's transcendence and the doctrine of Progressive Revelation formed the strongest confabulating gnostic device we've ever been subject to. 
<<<

Let me tell you (in my best deadpan): to put it mildly, Christians will give you a weird look if you say you are Christian but are willing to give up anything on that laundry list (if they even understood what you were talking about in the first place, no offense). And, yet, I felt very bound by my whittled down faith. I found enough philosophical ground to cover my bases even through all of that (some sweet/sick confabulatory backflips in philosophy, let me tell you). So, you have me all excited to tell you what I found, what remained after everything was stripped away. Here is the core of Christianity:

//The Two Great Commandments. //

<<<
[[RPIN]]: Duuuuuhhhhh. No shit, sherlock.
<<<

Was there ever any doubt? Everything else fades before them. Unfortunately,  after I finally gave up on the existence of God the Father (apparently, that was the last straw that finally broke the camel's back), I found I couldn't abide by the first of the Great Commandments: 

<<<
Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, The Lord is One; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind
<<<

I do not believe in God. I used to. The belief ruled me. I legitimately wish I could now (assuming it wouldn't fall apart again). Actually, what I really wish is that I had the hope and purpose of faith ([[RPIN]]: "But, hold the irrationality, please.") without the flaws of faith. The Tree of Knowledge, of course, is perilous. Unfortunately, I cannot unsee what I see. I cannot adopt the existence of God as my axiom. I cannot unify myself around it.

But, all is not lost. 

A few thoughts.

The Greatest Commandment is fundamentally about unifying ourselves around a particular target. I can't preserve the target, but I can preserve the unification clause of the commandment. I can preserve being a unified person. I must love X with all my heart, soul, and mind. We just need to fill the X in with something axiomatic.

<<<
[[KIN]]: The egoist fills X with himself. I cannot truly unify myself with and around that. Sorry, [[RPIN]].
<<<

<<<
[[RPIN]]: Keep empathizing with me. We will see. Even the egoist must love others in virtue of loving himself. It is the only way to get our shitty lizard brains to work correctly and provide us those delicious, unadulterated pleasure chemicals that eudaimonia is ultimately reduced down to. Those facts are the only reasons we are talking in the first place. I'm here because I'm convinced that by exploiting your empathy, you will eventually be converted. I'm so convinced by my axioms that I will flaunt the very dagger with which I'm going to stab you...right in front of your eyes. You will see it coming, and you will know. I treasure it. They say pride comes before the fall: may the odds be ever in your favor, homie. Let's dance.
<<<

The Zeroth Commandment still functions:

<<<
Be moral.
<<<

Moral law, by definition, overrides all others reasons. It is the blackbox which decides all others. It is the ruling principle we live by. It is our fundamental decision procedure. All thinking things have a zeroth law. Unfortunately, the commandment, as it stands, lacks content. How do we give it content without being vacuously circular? Whatever we take up as the content of that commandment is our true axiom. What will be the content-giving axiom to the Zeroth Commandment?

I hope it is the second of the Great Commandments:

<<<
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
<<<

If there is a God, may He judge me by, and may I be justified by my faith in the second of the Great Commandments. 

<<<
[[RPIN]]: Fore! Bombs away! Incoming! (that's sarcastic empathy)
<<<

Taken very literally, this maxim says something which I believe wasn't intended. I sound like a child in Sunday school asking a question that my poor teacher inevitably lacks the resources to answer:

<<<
What if I don't love myself? The commandment clearly does not require me to love my neighbor. 
<<<

I hear my dad loud and clear right now, as if he were sitting next to me quietly and kindly advising me. He's telling me to find the center of God's Will. He's telling me to find the spirit of the law, not the letter. He's telling me to be as much like Jesus as I possibly can. He's telling me to be a prophet, not a priest. He's telling me to be the idealist, not the pragmatist. He's telling me to go with [[KIN]], and yet he contradicts himself by also telling me to go with [[RPIN]]. How I can trust my father when he so blatantly violates the law of non-contradiction? That isn't unified at all. What is it that I'm even trusting? Don't you see the reason for my doubt!? Well. I'm still here trying, dad. I hope one day you will see I'm still trying (despite the fact that [[Adult Children of Alcoholics]], which you also seem to hold so dearly, actually suggests that I give up trying to trust you). I have not given up, not yet.

<<<
[[RPIN]]: Okay, we can't strawman Jesus' claim. That wouldn't be very *ahem* Christian of us. Fine. Let's steelman that shit. What did Jesus really mean?
<<<

To the best of my abilities, I have not been able to peel Empathy and Love apart. I think they are fused together, perhaps they are two facets of the same gem, if not philosophically identical. 

Thus, this is the Empathy Commandment. I h0p3 to take it up as my axiom. I need it to be my axiom. 

Who or what is the source of authority for this maxim? Is it something external to me? Maybe. I don't know. I am increasingly convinced that it is I who must give that law to myself. I must be autonomous. I must have faith in it; I must take it as my axiom. I must hardcode myself with it. I have hope that I can unify myself around this axiom. 

<<<
[[KIN]]: You must empathize with yourself, [[RPIN]]. But, if you empathize with yourself, you must empathize with others.
<<<

<<<
[[RPIN]]: I could disintegrate to the lowest level, and there I need not empathize with myself. However, I agree that it seems very unlikely that I would really maximize my utility going that direction. So, I agree. You've got me there. I must empathize with myself. However, that doesn't mean I have to categorically empathize with myself. What if I turned my empathy off at opportune moments? Ultimately, the egoist axiom can account for empathizing to our benefit, and we need not take up the spirit of this golden rule (even if we apply it to the letter).
<<<

<<<
[[KIN]]: Is it really empathy if you accept a principle which allows you to turn it off? I think not. I do not think you can unify yourself with it.
<<<

<<<
[[RPIN]]: So, my goal is to show you how we can become "bad" unified agents in the Korsgaardian sense? Let's do.
<<<

Now I'm trying to unify myself in spite of my residual Christianity, my leftover Christian intuitions I've been brainwashed to have since birth. I may not be able to erase, revise, or overwrite everything, but I'll do whatever I can to harmoniously reconstitute myself.

I was in denial about my faith for a long time. I must accept my deconversion and figure out a new path. Of course, I can hear my mother quietly hoping that this is God's intended journey for her sons, that there is some personal divine being carefully choreographing our struggle into something meaningful ("His Will be done"). I can hear her crying out. She sacrificed her children to God. I know her pain. I can feel it. 

Yes, I have a hard time swallowing such a sacrifice when I no longer accept the existence of the beneficiary. I am their victim, and yet I empathize with them deeply (as they do with their own parents). Some might call it Stockholm syndrome. I hope they are wrong. I honestly believe my parents meant (and still mean) well. Despite being wrong about the most important thing in the world (a mistake which I'm now forced to correct), I think they are brilliant people. The fact is: they cannot face their own demons. It would destroy them. I think they are deeply scarred and obsessively driven to be as faithful as they can be. They are heroes engaging in true Greek tragedy; it is the stuff of nightmares; it has been a farcically obscene overcommitment of their lives and their sons' lives (see: Poisonwood Bible) in the name of something Holy which has turned out just to be a scam. It is our family's tragedy. I forgive them. I hope we can manage something meaningful, and I hope to learn from their mistakes. I hope I have not already committed the same sins against my own children, or at least, I hope I have the chance to intervene and find the way which works. Let us hope empathy is the key.

-----------------------

<<footnotes "1" "This is not an exhaustive or detailed list. The order is roughly correct. I could write a very neat book on the topic (I have a uniquely rich perspective, I believe). I have no wish to destroy anyone's faith though, and I think my life is just sad in this respect. At any rate, I really did my best to be faithful despite an absurd amount of counterevidence and doubt.">>
