title: FTO Mode: Greyrock

//My empirical feasibility analysis demonstrates you are irredeemably dark-triadic. The mutably unforgivable is in virtue of yourself.//

Yikes. This is a helluvan outgroup.

Ironically, the transparent vulnerability of the wiki doesn't allow me to fully engage in the practice. To the extent that I can: I avoid interaction with you. I seek no drama. My observation and interaction with you is meant to be dull, boring, and mundane to you. I have the moral right not be a source of energy for you on your terms, vampire.
