* Vehicle registration.
** It should be serviced.
* I like that we are doing stuff outside. Let's keep it up!
* GRIND MOTHERFUCKER! 
* Ribs, wedges, and sprouts sound good.
* Should ping folks. I'm clearly more interested than they are. It will not fail on my account.
* Need to call the doctor's office. 
* I think I'm going to let [[Clicker Heroes]] slow down for now. They can incrementally build, but I want them on other topics as well. Breadth first.
