!! Respond to the following gem:

WikiLeaks ... compromised the security that governments are usually concerned about: their security from inspection by their own populations.

I have grown more suspicious of WikiLeaks, but I cannot deny this claim. Assange is going to be tortured (I suggest he has, and I don't simply mean isolation, but "enhanced interrogation" and perhaps worse). He upsets those who have centralized power by upsetting an axis in the centralization of information power. Even if he's imperfect, he's a hero for doing this. I would not want to be in his shoes tonight.
