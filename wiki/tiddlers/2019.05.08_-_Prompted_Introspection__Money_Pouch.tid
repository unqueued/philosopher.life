!! Where was a special place you always retreated to as a child

I can't recall any special retreat location, Samwise. In Mannsville, there were some ancient and dangerous country stairs to our basement (the narrow kind, though even these stairs were replaced) under which I hid my money pouch and some prized knick-knacks. I rarely visited it. In fact, I forgot about it for a while (I have no idea how) before finding it again. It was quite a treat to find the treasure I left for myself.
