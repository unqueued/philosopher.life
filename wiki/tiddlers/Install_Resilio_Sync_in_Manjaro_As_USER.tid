title: Install Resilio Sync in Manjaro As USER

I really want to run it as my user. Fuck permissions. I've had plenty of trouble getting Resilio Sync to work cleanly on Arch systems, and this is the way I do it now (see other options in `/etc/rslsync.con`):

```bash
yaourt -S rslsync
mkdir ~/.rslsync
mkdir ~/.config/rslsync/
nano ~/.config/rslsync/rslsync.conf
```

Modify the following and throw it into `rslsync.conf`:

```
{
   "device_name": "monster-10",
   "listening_port" : 4289, // 0 - randomize port

/* storage_path dir contains auxilliary app files if no storage_path field: .sync dir created
in current working directory */
  "storage_path" : "/home/h0p3/.rslsync",

/* set location of pid file */
  "pid_file" : "/home/h0p3/.rslsync/resilio.pid",

/* use UPnP for port mapping */
  "use_upnp" : true,

/* Enable WebUI */
 "webui" :
  {
    "listen" : "0.0.0.0:4288"

  /* preset credentials */
   ,"login" : "h0p3"
   ,"password" : "foobarpassword"
  }

}
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start rslsync
systemctl --user status rslsync #make sure it's clean, check in your browser it's working too
systemctl --user enable rslsync
```
