title: 2018.06.15 - Prompted Introspection: Superpower

//Let it be known that I failed to do this on the appointed day. Sorry.//

!! Which superpower would you choose to have if you had the option and why? Conversely, which superhero do you find to be the most overrated and why?

Lady Melisandre, you never attempt to limit me in your wish granting. 

Why, of course, my superpower is the ability to be "the most powerful genie in the world" for myself. Grant me the wish of infinite wishes. Why? Because I don't know what I don't know, and I can't tell you what superpowers really matter the most. I would be jumping into completely brand new contexts, and I would not wish to limit myself with some very poor initial choice. 

As to the second half, this is a different question, of course, since a superhero is not a superpower. In fact, I would argue that superheroes need not even have superpowers. I think Batman is a classic example of a superhero I despise. He is a character fashioned to be an apologist of Capitalism. He's a billionaire who spends his time fighting petty crime most of the time. I say that as someone who found the comics and the cartoon (and a couple movies) to be important to his life. It's not his power that bothers me exactly, it's how he uses it, what he stands for, and the real message his character and stories are conveying to us. I think it's propaganda.
