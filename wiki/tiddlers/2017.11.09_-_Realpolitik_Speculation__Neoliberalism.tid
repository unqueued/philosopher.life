title: 2017.11.09 - Realpolitik Speculation: Neoliberalism

Neoliberals take themselves to be finding a middle way between pure capitalism and centrally planned economies (often what they call communism). The goal is to harness the power of markets with the minimum regulation necessary to allocate wealth more sufficiently fairly than no-holds-barred laissez-faire Libertarianism (which ultimately gives way to the inefficiencies and totalitarianism of monopolies and oligopolies). Insofar as we all want efficient markets and minimal regulations on all institutions and peoples to maximize freedoms, we are all vacuously neoliberal. We all admire the goal, and we all admire flexibility, but I find most definitions of neoliberalism lack content. It's the equivalent of saying "anyone who is smart deserves my label." I'm neoliberal on such on an account, and so are most people (they just don't understand the means to their ends). 

Unfortunately, I do not see traditional neoliberals conceptually drawing meaningful (non-moving goal post) lines for using the state to regulate markets, employ monetary policy, and provide basic welfare. I admire their desire to understand what counts as sufficient empirical evidence and just redistributions, but they aren't very good at it. Some intelligent neoliberals go slightly more Left (along the lines of the self-described Democratic Socialists) down the orthodox Rawlsian route, claiming that neoliberalism is the best maximin satisfier. But like Rawls himself, they do not provide compelling arguments for why neoliberalism really is the justest ideology for constructing the basic institutions of society. I do not see why they can deliver on their promises. 

Neoliberals attempt to recognize the need to prevent the influence of special interests, individuals, corporations, etc. This is a good start, but they are not nearly zealous enough. Problematically, I find neoliberals to rely too heavily upon doing economics in a partial vacuum, where they get to make impractical assumptions that magically peel money and power apart when it is convenient for their theory.

It is an obvious fact that Politics is a market itself and that psychopaths fight with their moral gloves off, generating an innate absolute comparative advantage over all others. Neoliberals feel they should partially embrace this, and that ignores the real danger. Further, neoliberal policies will always advance society towards wealth+power oligopolies because all markets do. Profit margins continue to thin until fewer and fewer players can rationally compete in the market. Cutt-throat collusion among psychopaths is inevitable. Survival of the fittest brings winner-take-all markets. In other words, neoliberalism still leads to the centralization of power (albeit more gracefully than naked laissez-faire capitalism), and they really don't have the tools to fight it that they think they do. They really aren't scared enough (...and, that's often because they already live comfortable lives, in my experience). 

Ultimately, decentralizing power is the only way to prevent the disproportionate influence of special interests. Decentralizing power keeps psychopaths in check because it limits the damage they can deal more effectively than any other option. You need economic democracy too. Now, obviously, in an ideal Platonic City-State, the Philosopher King is a wise and just statesman. In practice, however, we have not found better answers than democracies (especially informed ones). Neoliberals do not understand the fundamental decentrality of power requirement well enough. Insofar as centralizing power is necessary for decentralizing power, we must accept it; there is no other option. But, we should go no further. That means that stronger attempts at wealth (a key form of power) equality, including access and opportunity, are far more necessary to fulfilling the maximin principle that generates maximum utility given diminishing margin returns than neoliberals generally push for. They've not got their eyes on the real means to the prize.

I uncharitably suggest neoliberalism presents a moving target and morphs into whatever possible point of view they can use to excuse capitalism (I don't meet many neolibs who aren't middle class or higher; forgive my assumption that their selfish bias prevents them from seeing the truth). I think they have obfuscated and misunderstood the options here. For example, they fail to see that socialism is not by definition centrally planned; it is conceptually open to other kinds of economies and political structures, just in case the "workers own the means of production." Neoliberals miss this and commonly equate socialism and communism. Essentially, their argument against socialism is a strawman bordering on red herring. You may want to pigeon-hole socialism as being centrally planned, but that is mistaken. More importantly, its actually hypocritical. What is central-planning? It's just the centralization of wealth/power (again, while they may be conceptually differently, they are fundamentally entangled; the practical difference slowly disappears). That's the broadest scope you can find, and there's a good conceptual reason to stick to it, lest we strawman. I posit that neoliberalism leads to more central-planning because it leads to more wealth inequality (which only spirals).

If we are to be fair, something like neoliberal policies and constant false compromises towards the right have ruled much of the Western world for half a century. It is not obviously working to the benefit of the poor. Have you seen the numbers of the rise of wealth inequality? It's a joke. Power has centralized more under neoliberalism than we could have dreamed. Centralized power IS a centrally planned economy, planned by the winners in the winner take all economies generated and supported by neoliberalism.

Communism is a favorite whipping-scarecrow. I commonly see historical anecdotes leveraged against it. But, these aren't good argument. I laugh when I hear statistics about the death caused by attempts to implement communism (and they try to be slick in conflating it with socialism). I have no problem conceding these failures. I'm also not pushing for communism directly (that is a utopia, an ideal, The Good, but not The Right given our context, in a sense), but rather socialism. More importantly, have you seen what capitalism has done? Jesus. Pot, kettle, black. Go sit in the corner. Capitalism is the force ending the human species, and neo-liberalism has deeply misunderstood/ignored the problem (again, I see ad hominem explanations for their justifications).

Maybe you think I've been unfair, that I've just not seen neoliberalism in action fully, or that I've ignored the examples. I'll have the charity not to call you out on a No True Scotsman if you don't call Socialists out on one. But, then...it seems like you still haven't answered the decentrality principle nearly as well as the socialist. But, go ahead and name your countries if it makes you feel better.

Do you have any idea how much the hyperclass has fought to destroy socialism, to punish any nation that would possibly be a living example of the value of decentralizing power? Why do you think we went to war in Vietnam? Why do you think the CIA has interfered with countless elections, assassinated leaders, and installed their own? Who held the reins? Socialism was not self-defeating, it has been directly attacked to preserve the centrality of wealth and power in capitalist countries. Socialism has not fought dirty like that. Are you comparing apples and oranges here? I think so. 

What, you think China is neoliberal? Are you even paying attention? They don't engage in fair trade practices, nor do they respect intellectual property rights, nor any other standard Western rule of international law in any meaningful way (the US, obviously, is hardly the good guy here). The country's socioeconomics are heavily controlled by a single party in ways that are difficult to imagine. It's because they reject neoliberal policy that they've burgeoned. It's classic central-planning with deeply controlled markets vs. your neoliberalism. China is a terrible example for you. 

You might claim it isn't so hot for my definition of socialism either since China and the West suggest centralizing power is the best option. I concede I have no examples to point to, but that doesn't make the principle wrong: decentralize power. Your way is not working. We have to find another.

I will add that neoliberalism benefits poor nations for a time; I grant that. It trades in on opportunity costs and comparatives that the poorest nations have in cheap labor and desperation, but when higher wages are eventually sought, their windfall plateaus. We just use poor nations, and neo-liberalism is a mask we use to do it. Internationally, it's still a macro-scale state of nature and tribalism. Neoliberalism is not going to solve that because it ultimately centralizes power (and likely because we're just fucked anyways).

Of course, you should accuse me of not having an answer. I don't. Let me say in defense that while your driving towards the cliff at 20mph instead of 50mph is less accelerationist than pure capitalism, it's still going off the cliff. You are still being shortsighted. I don't have an answer, but that doesn't mean we should continue to try it your way. Ultimately, I do not know how to solve the problem of human selfishness; I've not even found a sound metaethics to handle it yet. I'm convinced your path is dead to us though. 

Let me reiterate again, you all keep missing the fundamental problem of wealth inequality: it is power centralization. The moment you think you can harness the selfishness in the human pyramid scheme instead of fighting and defending against it the entire way is when you've lost sight of even a hope of solving the problem. The socialist draws the line in the sand at "workers own the means of production," and I'm still convinced that is the best hope decentrality hope we have.

Neoliberalism is, at best, a half-assed attempt. You are not frantic or flexible enough to see there are better radical options. You don't want a radical change though, do you? =) You like your comfortable lifestyle. As long as you live a good life before the world ends, as long as you get yours in the tragedy of the commons, then you don't actually care. Be honest, my neoliberal friend, you are fundamentally selfish, just like the rest of us. It just so happens that your selfishness carries you away from the truth in this case because it benefits you more.
