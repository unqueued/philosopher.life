title: 2018.02.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Fashion Decade Preferences

!! Which decade of clothing fashion was your favorite and least favorite?<<ref "2019.03.26">>

I suppose the reason it became shameful not to wear clothes was because it was a sign of being too stupid or poor to have empathized with yourself enough to have crafted clothing to keep yourself warm during the nights and winters. This is virtual signaling. Essentially, it is a display of being a poor tool user for the sake of survival turned into social tool-statement itself. That is possibly the kernel of the evolution of clothing and shame of nakedness.

I love nudity. That might be my favorite decade (the cave person era). But, I suppose I'd find those primates ugly. So, I'm going with each passing decade as being my favorite. Humans, on average, may be getting sexier. Good for us!

Least favorite? I don't know. I don't actually give a shit about this question. Don't you understand, Samwise? Who the fuck cares? Do you really think clothing is a significant expression of your identity? 

Look, I'm not saying that clothing doesn't provide reliable inductive indicators of who we are, what we do for a living, etc. Most people lack significant innerlives; they are hollow, shallow, useless cunts. Yes, you can read a ton of books by their covers, at least enough so to reasonably act. Yes, this is not deductively valid, but it is eminently practical and therefore necessary to being wise.

I wear clothes as warpaint, as a status token of entrance into society. Those primates aren't going to listen or respect my actual human dignity until their eyes are satisfied. I got it. It's manipulation. Those who think it's not have clearly drunk that koolaid so deeply that they can't escape their distorted perceptions of who we are. You poor fools. I truly hate you.
