* Think About It
** https://philosophynow.org/issues/131/A_New_Twist_on_Old_Ideas
*** Gah! I'm less interested in historical Kant than I am in Steelmanned Kant. It is important to see that Kant offers the groundwork to the metaphysics of morals, and Marx doesn't fucking have a metaethic (or a metaphysics, imho). They do join together (yes, a thousand philosophers cry out in protest). 
** https://philosophynow.org/issues/131/Marx_and_Nietzsche
*** Marx fought for something that actually matters; he could only explain, but he couldn't justify. Nietzsche fucking conflates description and prescription: he's garbage for it (though still worth analysis).
** https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/bb0xlw/what_do_poststructuralists_make_of_john_rawls/
*** There's some good work in there. If you keep following the Rawlsian memeplex lineage, you'll see constructivism in both camps. Of course, I aim to destroy you all.

*** Yikes. They fucked up on those trait definitions.

*** I will likely be erased in time. Noice.

*** It turns out that strict Pareto improvement probably doesn't exist in the material dialectic. The maximin is the only principle that stands.
*** The Locke scholars I know would flip their shit at the consequentialist claims here.
*** Fascinating hidden conclusion. =)
*** Perhaps I should send them my work.

*** And, yet, no computer is going to be able to able to organize my information using complex syntax like this wiki for me. I'm still going to have to direct it in that regard.

*** No discussion of capitalism, as usual TATL.

*** Weird. Somethings off, but it's only a bullshit detector. Can't put a finger on it.
** https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-urgent-quest-for-slower-better-news
*** Uh, I think it's because I have access to non-mainstream points of view, I'm able to take the temps of the masses, and I have faster news that I can see what I do as well. This appears to be more overton window rhetoric.
** https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-09/financial-tyranny-america-has-become-pay-play-exercise-fascism
*** So close, but so far, as usual. You blame taxes and government, but you don't point to the workers owning the means of production. You've already lost the war.
** https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2018/11/07/a-worldwide-debt-default-is-a-real-possibility/#6e85746853aa
*** Austerity without socializing the means of production. This is a dogwhistle, again. They'll still QE to protect the wealthy until it collapses.
