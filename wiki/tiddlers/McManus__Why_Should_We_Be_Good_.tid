title: McManus: Why Should We Be Good?

https://quillette.com/2018/07/07/why-should-we-be-good/

<<<
Today we are witnessing an irrepressible and admirable pushback against the specters of ‘cultural relativism’ and moral ‘nihilism.’ On the Right, thinkers such as Patrick Deneen and Jordan Peterson have responded to an increasingly cynical postmodern culture by arguing for a return to traditionalist and/or local values.
<<<

Far too charitable. I consider them realpolitik practitioners of pomo. 

<<<
More centrist thinkers such as Steven Pinker and Sam Harris have argued for a return to the Enlightenment’s emphasis on using reason and its handmaiden, empirical science, to develop an ever more objective set of ethical norms. 
<<<

They aren't the center; they are still wildly to the right. Again, realpolitik.

<<<
far-Left, radical thinkers such as Alain Badiou and Slavoj Zizek have levelled scathing attacks against postmodern relativism and ‘totalitarian’ identity politics, 
<<<

Men I admire. It's not clear to me they've been good metamoderns though.

Not sure I can agree to your spectrum here, and it's not clear to me many of these people are wrestling against postmodernism. They push against features and outgrowths of it.

<<<
Indeed, relativism and the moral nihilism with which it is often affiliated, seems to be in retreat everywhere. 
<<<

Wait, why should I agree to that claim? There aren't many people I know who don't ultimately fall into this trap. I feel like I'm barely clinging onto hope for an answer, and I'm wrestling very hard for transcendental realism.

Kant has caused us to eat ourselves because we can't defeat the correlationist shadowcircle.

<<<
The negative motivation arises from moral dogmatism...Ethical dogmatists do not want to be confronted with the possibility that it is possible to challenge their values because they often cannot provide good reasons to back them up.
<<<

I'm dogmatic about the reality of morality. That is exactly what postmodernism is going to attack. Choose our "Bob" turtle of "Turtles all the way down," and pomo is going to deconstruct it. I get that it's painful to being open to changing one's [[Axioms|Axioms of h0p3]], in being heuristical about improving our ethical intuitions and inferences, etc. 

I also suggest it is our plight to be dogmatic about constituting ourselves with principles. You have to be dogmatic. Paradox of Tolerance shows up, I get it. 

I think you painting some of our enemies but not fairly recognizing this applies to us all.

<<<
Bloom wasn’t an ethical dogmatist who was unhappy that his students didn’t hold to his particular set of values...What made Bloom unhappy was that these students rejected the whole idea that there could be any universal values.
<<<

Nope. You don't get to have it both ways. Clearly, if you have a "moral" problem with rejectiong of universal values, you are being dogmatic. 

<<<
 The issue I wish to explore is this: even if we know which values are universal, why should we feel compelled to adhere to them?
<<<

Why be moral? Why choose to bind ourselves with/to [[The Moral Law]]? Classic questions. I actually think these are fundamentally incoherent questions. [[2018.09.18 - CATI: Ontological Proof of The Right]]. I think we beg the question; it's inescapable.

<<<
 This posed a serious problem for future scientifically minded ethicists, as it became clear that just knowing objective facts about human nature and desires couldn’t necessarily lead us to a clear set of ethical values.
<<<

The is/ought problem is a big one, and it's clearly connected to the "why be moral?" question. This is Ontological Proof territory. If you think there is an "ought," then you take those to be the overriding reasons by definition. Anyone who questions the reality of "ought" isn't even talking about "ought" in the first place. That you can't derive an "ought" from an "is" does not mean we can deny the is-ness of ought-ness. 

Again, this is faith. It's question begging. Either [[The Moral Law]] is your axiom or it's not. I agree that one can choose not to bind themselves with [[The Moral Law]], but the question of whether or not one "should" bind oneself with [[The Moral Law]] already assumes you've taken a position. If you think you can even question whether or not to bind yourself with [[The Moral Law]], then you clearly don't have [[The Moral Law]] in mind and/or you've already denied its existence in the very question itself. It's like logic in being fundamental in our epistemic reasoning. [[The Moral Law]] just is constitutive of Reason itself.

<<<
So Kant argued that we simply must push the doubts of pure reason aside to make way for “faith.”
<<<

HE'S RIGHT! Yeah, I think he does the trascendental divide a disservice, but he's right on this. The Neo-Kantians move towards a constructivism, an internalist commune, an emergence from our minds, an intersubjectivity that somehow is objective. Lol. No, the old-school Kantian teachers I've had who point to some external metaphysics are likely correct about this issue.

<<<
that each one is morally bound to regard the good of any other individual as much as his own.
<<<

[[The Golden Rule]] just is [[The Categorical Imperative]]. Doesn't look like this move has gotten us one iota closer.

<<<
The Self and Self-Interest is What Matters
<<<

Yup. Denying [[The Golden Rule]] to arrive at a twisted version of it. Egoism is a quagmire. It can be, almost ad hoc, conceptually true if want make it so.

<<<
We should then develop an ethical framework that meshes with these natural features of the human personality.
<<<

Unless our natures are objectively wrong, lol. That we take into the account of who are in developing our maxims (the circumstantial context embedded in the maxim) is necessary, but obviously doesn't itself provide guidance. Standard is/ought failure. It imbues evolution with teleology we probably can't help ourselves to so easily.

<<<
The final claim is that the values which ‘matter’ in some sense exist independently of us.
<<<

Amen. 

<<<
The most passionate defender of such independent values was the late Derek Parfit.
<<<

Mmm...I'm pretty worried that he doesn't give an adequate defense of this! Again, "Cognitive of what?" - [[McManus: Parfit]].
