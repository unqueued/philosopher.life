* Think About It

*** Contextualism continually reborn. The contingent is crucial to understanding if there is [[The Right]] at all. But, the rightness is going to be need to be objective or we lose it all.

*** I don't see why I have to agree. There is clearly a virtue, a techne, an artistic practice, to achieving eudaimonia. Let me agree that it doesn't boil down to the aesthetic, but to some unification of [[The Good]] and [[The Right]] which happens to also be [[The Beauitful]] in some respects.

*** My worry is that the software ecosystem can't adjust effectively enough. You think being stuck on an OS platform is tough? CPU architecture seems even harder. My many ARM devices have shown me that I just don't have access to everything I want using them at the end of the day. It seems more likely to me that I'd rather pay the price to virtualize whatever I'm missing in them or use them as specialty devices. Admittedly, I'd have made the same case about Linux before, and that's changing. I do think learning ARM's assembly could be a valuable investment.
