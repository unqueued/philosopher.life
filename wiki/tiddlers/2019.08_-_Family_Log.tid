!! Audit:

* WoW completely fucking ruled my life.
** Hilariously, while my family have joked with me about it, they've all been happy to see me play. 
*** I think my offspring like that I'm not focusing my lazers on them all day everyday, and my wife is ridiculously generous in her begging me to go have fun, even with addictions. 
* This has been an action packed month. My wife and I jumped back into our primary work, transitions with the kids have been rough, and we've had interviews and waiting to see how things go.
* I've done a great job accomplishing something only if it is related to WoW or public school chillun.
* We've considered trying to expand this month after month. We have no idea how to make solid improvements. I've been shot down many times, understandably. 
** This really only captures a snapshot. Sometimes it is a can-opener, and other times a compressed image.
