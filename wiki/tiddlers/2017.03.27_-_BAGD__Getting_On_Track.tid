title: 2017.03.27 - BAGD: Getting On Track

I think it is crucial that I find a way to help my son become as happy as he can be given the circumstances he has. Right now, I'm helping him get on track. He's doing a good job. We've done well with what we have. I'm very proud of him. We still have a long way to go though. Maximizing our potential is hard, and we never give up on it. Getting him to do his work without needing to be told is hard, as it would be for any 9-year-old. We're pushing regimen as much as we can. We also keep moving the goalposts (encouragingly!). It is a climb for him. He's doing well. He's working hard. He's got a good attitude. He's doing his best.
