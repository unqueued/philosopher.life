title: 2018.02.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Student Uniforms

!! What do you think about students having to wear school uniforms?

I hope they look incredibly sexy in them, like "Baby One More Time" hawt. 

I think schools are Lord of the Flies bubbles. I'm not sure that uniforms solve that problem. Distinctions can still be made from small differences. I think uniform concerns are missing the forest for the trees though, at least in the United States.
