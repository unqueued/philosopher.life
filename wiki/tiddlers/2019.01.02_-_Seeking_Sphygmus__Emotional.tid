title: 2019.01.02 - Seeking Sphygmus: Emotional

I'm reading, but I'm not writing enough.<<ref "c">>

I am delighted to see [[Sphygmus]] coming out of her terminal shell wiki. Her work is an emotional read for me. It sounds like her letters to me, but it's also far more personal. She is writing her wiki to herself, and it's vivid. I'm not sure what to do with all these feels. Watching her [[Monthly Audit]]s is refreshing. Her anxiety is palpable; I can feel it. I don't (and probably can't) ultimately know why hugging works (even though I've studied it some), but I wish I could give a her hug when I read some of her words. 

She clearly spends herself (wisely I would argue!) to put herself into words. Her suffering makes something beautiful.<<ref "y">>

[[The Ol' Yeller Clause]]

One of my gravest concerns in making sure I maintain [[T42T]] with [[Sphygmus]] is that I am judgmental in a way that is adaptive to her. It is conceptually impossible not to engage in judgment. Some version of what Saint Kant says is correct here. I am, as usual, a shitty mean wrestler even when I'm trying not to be.

I can see she's building her [[RGM]] too. I think whatever she is doing is something Jed needs to think very carefully about. She's clearly trailblazing in the private->public side. I am still unsure how much Bob will help her. It can do some of the work manually. Is she going to parse .tids from outside the wiki (maybe she already is...seems like it to some extent)?

She calls it "Weaving With h0p3."<<ref "p">> I love that word.

<<footnotes "c" "It's felt so crazy busy to me. That's not a good excuse, but that's the way it feels. I know she cuts me as much slack as I need too (for which I'm grateful).">>

<<footnotes "y" "[[The Beautiful]] appears to require work by definition. ">>

<<footnotes "p" "Okay, [[Sphygmus]] has been doing literally all the lifting here in linking between our wikis. I need to put some serious thought into how we can mesh our named/tagged tiddlers together. Perhaps UNILINK is the answer (that thing breaks my wiki!...go with something tailored and lightweight, specific to the purpose. UNIX PRINCIPLE!!). Perhaps it will link to a URL or anything. As long as I can swap out what the pointer references, we'd be fine.">>
