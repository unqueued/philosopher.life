title: 2019.01.16 - Sphygmus: The Letter
type: text/plain

I'm curious where k0sh3k sees the grammar error in "And these are the things I put in it."?
To my eye/ear, "these <the words below> are the things I put in it <this page>" which makes grammatical sense to me.

"Ah, wellâ€”so this page is my box. And these are the things I put it in it."

It's the "it in it" I believe.

This letter is taking it out of me.
WED 12:09 AM
oh my word I kept looking for a grammar error and kept blindly reading what I assumed it said :sweat_smile:

I can feel your effort and emotion when reading the letter! I'm in awe.

Imho, to have predictive coding that corrects errors is a sign of a profound sign of linguistic empathy. To literally perceive the world as it was meant to be by the [[other]] rather than the mere syntax requires habituation.

I'm grateful to have you reading, feeling, and thinking about the letter with me.

I have no idea how to explain to jbaty and dziggetai what we're doing.
WED 12:25 PM
I guess they just have to read and do their thing at the table. If they join, they join.
WED 12:27 PM
for many number of assorted reasons, I don't think many people are aware of their ability to be aware, or to exercise that awareness. I'm not sure what we're doing //can// be explained to those people.
WED 12:53 PM
I also agree -- in at least one way this is something they have to join and experience to understand; they can't just sit outside the sandbox and watch the children playing in the mud and think they understand, they have to jump in and play with us.
WED 12:55 PM
obviously we're doing much more than playing, but yeah.
