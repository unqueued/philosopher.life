How do you find good music?
JAN 4 9:30 PM
Like, what's the process?
JAN 4 9:30 PM
(you think I'd have figured this one out by now)
JAN 4 9:31 PM
I generally don't find good music -- all my favorite bands sort of came to me: my very  first favorite singer I heard on the radio and it gripped me; my first favorite rock band I discovered in a drawing tutorial on DeviantArt?! I've also discovered several through TV show songs, though I actually have no clue how I found two of my top played artists on last.fm
JAN 4 9:47 PM
A couple have been recommended to me, and a couple more have come from listening to lots of various songs hunting for things I liked.
JAN 4 9:48 PM
Oh noes. That sounds like where I'm at.
JAN 4 9:49 PM
I need my drug!
JAN 4 9:49 PM
Lol.
JAN 4 9:49 PM
It's weird, I've definitely gone through phases with the artists I listen to -- usually I only listen to one band at a time, obsessively, and then move on to another one (so looking at my last.fm is like a musical timeline). But lately I've fallen out of that pattern, and I'm not sure where I've landed! Mostly just listening to lofi radio on YouTube, haha.
JAN 4 9:51 PM
also one of your posts made me go listen to a song -- but I'm hugely a lyrics person so that makes a big difference
JAN 4 9:52 PM
Yes!
JAN 4 9:52 PM
I don't have your skill. You clearly have the verbal talent too.
JAN 4 9:52 PM
I'm afraid I won't be of much use to you on the music front.
JAN 4 9:53 PM
I've just noticed that I've not been finding more songs, and I think there is something wrong about my method.
JAN 4 9:53 PM
Lofi radio is awesome. =)
JAN 4 9:54 PM
Are you able to work with lyrics in the background?
JAN 4 9:55 PM
[[j3d1h]] and I are working on the Bob upgrade again (we tried 5.1.18 and rolled back...now we try 19).
JAN 4 9:55 PM
I'm wandering in the music desert! :)

The first question to mind is -- what are you looking for? I expect the method changes based on the answer. When I obsess over an artist it's usually because I'm taking solace in the lyrics, or because the sound taps a specific YES for me. There's a difference between music I'm merely content to listen to, and music that I can't get enough of, play in repeat type thing.

Lyrics - it depends. At work work I'm okay with lyrics because most of the time I'm doing tedious stuff that doesn't require thought, and the distraction is nice. Also half the time I don't get to pick the music :woman-shrugging:

When I'm doing my own work -- reading or writing -- I can't stand lyrics. 

> rabbit holed! I remembered there was actually a band I studied with in college - I thought it was solstafir at first but now I think it's Russian circles

But yea - I always end up singing along to lyrics (even if they're in other languages) so they're fine sometimes but definitely not always.

I hope it works for you! Right now I'm like...if it ain't broke don't fix it, but I'm sure the multi-browser editing would be nice.
JAN 4 10:08 PM
*if it ain't broke...re: my implementation
JAN 4 10:09 PM
Makes excellent sense.
JAN 4 10:09 PM
I held onto singlefile for 2 years (and I still miss several aspects of it).
JAN 4 10:09 PM
No reason to move unless you know it's necessary.
JAN 4 10:09 PM
I think my next step is finding recommendation engines based upon the information I have.
JAN 4 10:12 PM
the wandering is not turning up an oasis anymore
JAN 4 10:12 PM
do you wear out your music to the point of being unable to listen to it because you're sick of it? and do you give albums a run through or do you stick with individual songs?
JAN 4 10:13 PM
well, I tend to only hear music (imho); albums (barring maybe 3-4 exceptions) are never fitting for me. I'm just interested in more awesomeness. I could listen to my current 500 for the rest of my life (I intend to).
JAN 4 10:14 PM
I know some people who collect songs but I, usually not always, to give albums a fair shot (hoping to find more of the first song I liked)
JAN 4 10:14 PM
It's an interesting difference
JAN 4 10:14 PM
Yes. I try to go through lots of their music to see if they have any other [[diamonds]].
JAN 4 10:15 PM
Most of the time, they are 1-hit wonders for me.
JAN 4 10:15 PM
hm, yeah. Most of the time if I listen to an album at least twice I discover more depths I enjoy. but that also takes time & listening which I don't do anymore. :P
JAN 4 10:16 PM
Lol. That sucks!
JAN 4 10:20 PM
I'm sorry about that.
JAN 4 10:21 PM
10,000 things to do
JAN 4 10:21 PM
There music you are content to listen to vs. can't get enough (in repeat) is something I feel strongly. You can basically throw anything on and I'll listen to it. The addictive music, now that's hard to find. =)
JAN 4 10:22 PM
you lost me - what sucks? Not listening to music anymore?
JAN 4 10:26 PM
It might suck and I hadn't noticed! having a void in the music timeline...old songs are definitely powerful memory triggers for me.
JAN 4 10:27 PM
true!
JAN 4 10:27 PM
we are wired for that
JAN 4 10:27 PM
I meant not feeling like you have time for listening to albums twice for your exploration process.
JAN 4 10:28 PM
Old songs are special though. You can always let them go for a long time, and then come back to them.
JAN 4 10:30 PM
ahhh, yeah. well, I haven't taken the time to listen to albums either - heck, I just realized both the bands I mentioned have put out new music I hadn't listened to, oops - really I haven't //listened// in maybe the past year? Not the same way I used to. Maybe it's b/c I have less time for it, maybe I'm looking for less in it? 

re: old songs, truth!
