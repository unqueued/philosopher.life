title: 2011.04.29 - Connecting Self-Interested Utility-Maximizing Agents to the Difference Principle

John Rawls, in //A Theory of Justice//, offers a powerful social contractarian heuristic device for determining the principles of justice. In this paper, I attempt to defend the Rawlsian view of distributive justice by offering a stronger conceptual link between utility-maximizing agents in this device and the ‘difference principle’ it yields. The difference principle is supposedly chosen because of our innate risk aversion, but the literature on this topic remains unclear on how or why utility-maximizing agents would be interested in the distribution of primary social goods yielded by the difference principle. I will offer a justification for this risk aversion, filling in an untold gap in this story, whereby we can connect utility-maximization to the difference principle by examining the relationship between primary social goods and the economic principle of diminishing marginal utility.

The “basic structure” of society, as described by Rawls, is constituted by formal, legal, political and economic institutions. How best to configure the basic structure is a central to justice, in Rawls’ view, because it fixes the distribution of goods, services, opportunities, authorities, and rights. The basic structure is the initial subject of justice. It is here (either for the creation of a basic structure or as an assessment of one) that one can begin to question and formulate the principles of justice which normatively define the various possible configurations of the basic structure. Principles of justice design, specify, assess and justify the blueprints, arrangement and practices of these institutions and the overall basic structure. Rawls is famous for this device which formulates the principles of justice, a device he calls the “original position.” 

The original position is a type of thought experiment, an abstraction, a hypothetical instance of drawing up a social contract among members of society, and a method of thinking about justice. The parties within the original position are meant to agree upon whatever counts as the fair and correct principles of justice used to generate the basic structure to which they would find themselves subject outside of the original position. The original position structures intuitions we have about justice and how we formulate them – the original position is designed to provide an impartial justice, and render a stable society. Notably, the concern for impartiality and fairness is what leads us to the most profound and potent fixture in the original position, what Rawls calls the “veil of ignorance.”

Agents in the original position find themselves ‘behind’ a veil of ignorance. While behind this veil, “no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities.”<<ref "1">> Agents are deprived of the knowledge of their personal particularities, what societies they come from, and their histories. Some of the attributes which count as morally arbitrary in Rawls’ eyes might be considered controversial (e.g. your religious beliefs), but let us pass this by. The essential point, to which I think we can all intuitively agree, is that differences which are arbitrary from the moral point of view don’t count with regards as to how the principles of justice treat you. 

Agents behind the veil must be detached from their actual, particular circumstances when formulating the principles of justice. Proper justice requires we answer a hypothetical question: If you couldn't know who you were, what would you choose? This makes a lot of sense - it removes bias. Thus, the principles of justice which are produced from within the original position and behind the veil of ignorance are in some sense impartial and unbiased. 

What then constitutes these agents, these amorphous creatures which have shed morally arbitrary features? Rawls believes these agents have a sense of justice, being willing to comply with what is required by justice. They are also free and equal agents. Vitally, agents behind the veil are rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizers.<<ref "2">> These characteristics provide the motivation and mindset of agents formulating the principles of justice. They have the necessary tools and knowledge to formulate the correct principles of justice, to know what is normatively just and fair about different configurations of basic structures given their rational, mutually disinterested, utility-maximizing characters. While ignorant of particularities, agents are extremely knowledgeable about generalities. They have a commanding knowledge of general facts about human nature, psychology, sociology, political science, biology, and economics. Thus, with this knowledge, from behind the veil of ignorance, agents are able to rationally construct and agree to the principles of justice, even agreeing with principles which might not benefit them as the individuals they are outside of the original position.

Rawls is very thorough, and despite the hypothetical nature of the original position, he is also practical. He invents an apt regression test procedure used to make sure we actually agreed to the correct principles of justice. He calls this the “reflective equilibrium.” Employing the reflective equilibrium allows agents to go back and forth between the original position and reality. This method allows us to continually justify and revise (if necessary) the principles of justice. 

Interestingly, it just so happens that Rawls thinks he knows exactly which principles of justice would be chosen from within the original position. They essentially are:

# The Principle of Greatest Equal Liberty - People are to be as free as possible.

# The Difference Principle - Social and economic advantages should be distributed in order to maximize the shares of the most disadvantaged, those on the bottom line. Maximize the minimum.<<ref "3">>

First off, these principles are lexically ordered in priority. The first principle is the most important one, and the second merits consideration after maximally satisfying the first. Intuitively, it seems that there might be many possible basic structures which equally maximize the first principle, and the second principle does the work of assigning further normative value, effectively acting as a tie-breaker to the subset of initially acceptable basic structures generated by the first.

The first principle of justice is concerned with maximizing basic rights and liberties for all citizens, including political liberties, freedom of speech, freedom of association, religious liberty, etc. The second principle is about maximizing the wealth, material goods, and services for the lowest margins of society. For many liberal intuitions, the first principle is the least controversial. The principle of greatest equal liberty seems a very plausible product of rational utility-maximizers in the original position, particularly given classic utilitarian views on liberty. There seems to be an acceptable and ostensible story which we can tell, about how rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizing agents in the original position, as defined by Rawls, would create and agree upon the first principle. The second principle is a particular brand of distributive justice theory, including why we should believe (as Rawls believes) that utility-maximizing agents in the original position would choose this particular principle of distributive justice. This, perhaps, is more controversial. Rational utility-maximization isn’t so clearly linked to the difference principle. Part of this story seems to be missing. In order to see why, let’s dig a bit deeper into the ramifications of the difference principle, going through an example of it as a decision procedure. 

What follows is an oversimplified example, but it will nicely demonstrate how the difference principle is generated and applied. 
Consider the following monetary table and the explanation of it which follows:

Figure 1

The table represents a hypothetical choice. Agents in the original position need to make an algorithmic, procedurally-based choice between the three possible, yet different distributions of wealth. Let us assume that each option equally satisfies the principle of greatest equal liberty; it is then up to the difference principle to decide which type of distributive structure is normatively best. A more complex table could certainly make sense of other types of units which belong to distributive justice, but let’s assume we’ve converted all such objects into monetary value. There is only one type of unit to be distributed, in this case money; let’s arbitrarily say thousands of Euros annually per person. Quartiles represent a fourth of the population, and people in each quartile make the specific annual salary determined by the respective distributive economy. Note that the totals are different, which is to be expected, as different economic structures have different sum total outcomes.

What would the agents in the original position choose? Everyone is behind the veil of ignorance; they don’t know which option will bring greatest benefit to them individually, outside of the veil. Agents behind the veil are in a game of limited information. They need a strategic formula to determine which distribution is best, particularly because they lack the knowledge of which particular quartile they will find themselves in, when outside the original position.

According to Rawls, the difference principle is the formula they would choose to apply, as it alone offers us the correct decision procedure and just distributive outcome. What does it actually do in this case? Well, maximizing the minimum requires we examine the 1st Quartile to the exclusion of everything else on the table. According to the difference principle, in this hypothetical choice, whichever distribution has the highest annual salary in the 1st Quartile determines what counts as the most just basic structure. In this case, the socialized market is what the difference principle requires us to select.

It isn’t clear, however, why we should believe Rawls’ assumption that agents behind the veil of ignorance would choose the difference principle; and furthermore, it isn’t clear why they prefer the distribution of the Socialized Market in the choice represented in Figure 1. Why should we think that a rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizing agent with generalized knowledge would make these conclusions? There is an untold gap in the story, and it becomes clear with examples. One would like to think that Rawls isn’t begging the question; surely there are good and plausible bridges over this gap. Consider an exaggerated modification of the table:

Figure 2

	By the difference principle, the socialized market is still chosen in the question presented in Figure 2. But, now, the difference principle as a strategy seems much weaker. The economist/gambler in all of us sees the opportunity cost in selecting the socialized market, and here the difference principle doesn’t seem so reasonable. The odds are really good that you’ll be very, very rich in the feudal economy in Figure 2. Obviously, this is very hypothetical; proponents of the difference principle might argue that the feudal economy is Figure 2 isn’t a real possibility at all (a fair argument, in my view). Yet it also seems very possible to scale down the exaggeration and have plausible counterexamples, which might lead rational utility-maximizers away from the difference principle. 

Figure 2 forces us to entertain the possibility that agents in the original position wouldn't choose the difference principle. From behind the veil, not knowing to which quartile one actually belongs, it is reasonable to think that agents might employ the primitive game theory strategy of selecting the structure which provides the highest mean average salary (or look at the structure which brings about the highest sum total of salaries). Clearly, this strategy would promote the feudal economy rather than the socialized market in Figure 2. 

“But wait!” exclaims the proponent of the difference principle. Surely, we can see that you have a 25% chance to be completely impoverished in the feudal economy. The fear of ending up on the bottom carries a great deal weight, especially if the bottom quartile ends up with practically nothing, as in the case of the above feudal economy. Some proponents of Rawls' difference principle contend the bridge is based upon risk aversion, which is what enables us to rationally deny the feudal economy, greatly increasing the merits of both the socialized economy and the difference principle which selects it. 

According to this risk aversion theory, some degree of risk aversion is a characteristic derived from being a rational utility-maximizer, and thus a fundamental reason underlying the difference principle is risk aversion. It does seem that the larger the stakes, the more risk averse we become, and this choice is for all the distributive marbles, so I can strongly sympathize with the risk aversion theory. What might be the proper account of this risk aversion theory isn't clear. Is it only being risk averse to complete catastrophe, as we saw in Figure 2? And, if so, does this really support the difference principle? Imagine a modification of Figure 2:

Figure 3

Complete catastrophe is certainly avoided in both. Notice, the margin of difference between the lowest quartiles is relatively small, 500 Euros a year, but the rest of the economy is strikingly different. It seems that we can go back to the gambler strategy, which is certainly a strategy about weighing risks! If you were at the bottom quartile in the socialized market wouldn’t you spend 500 Euros per year for a 75% chance to make between 200 thousand to 1 million Euros each year instead? This is the sort of hypothetical question which suggests that the risk aversion theory might need more work if it is eventually going to point towards the difference principle. Even if this hypothetical is too exaggerated, surely we can conceive of less extreme examples which have similar worries attached. 

	What sort of risk aversion theory plausibly supports the difference principle? Part of the problem is that our discussion isn’t in the right language. For any proper theory acting as a bridge between rational utility-maximizers and whatever end principle of distributive justice is chosen, the story must be told in language of utility. Nothing we’ve seen so far really does that explicitly. As we zoom in on this utility story, we’ll see that a risk aversion theory, explained in the language of utility, very plausibly supports the difference principle.

	One does not weigh the objects of distributive justice outright; one must weigh units of utility. There is a conversion process which must occur in order for utility-maximizers to begin to normatively evaluate objects of distributive justice. Objects of distributive justice are converted into units of utility. But, since risk aversion deals with the objects of distributive justice, and it can’t weigh units of utility, clearly what counts as risk aversion must be broken down into utility values. The risk aversion theorist is claiming that the utilitarian conversion algorithm has built into it the principle of risk aversion as one of its sub-formulas. And, if this is true, then essentially utility values already have built into them the merits of risk of aversion. 

Weighing the average of some unit (however complex the formula to generate these units) has to be the only rational measurement. In this sense, the primitive strategy from the discussion of figure 2 was approaching something really important. Rational decision procedures in game theory are dominated by the notion that one must choose whichever option has the highest average utility. The primitive strategy, however, wasn’t selecting the highest average utility; it was selecting the highest average salary, its selection was based on monetary units, not utility units. These are very, very different, and that is why the risk aversion theorist may claim that the primitive strategy might fail. It is then up to the risk aversion theorist to provide an argument about utility which supports his or her own claim. 

One of the more famous economic theories, namely, the theory of diminishing marginal utility, does just this work for the risk aversion theorist.<<ref "4">> There are diminishing utility returns for each subsequent unit of any object of distributive justice, including money. The first 10k Euros will yield more utility than then next 10k Euros. This makes practical sense as well. Surely, on average, the resources necessary to survive will produce more utility for an agent than the same amount of resources added to the salary of someone who already has enough to survive. While the theory of diminishing marginal utility is not water-tight, perfectly proven, it is at least widely recognized as a plausible economic theory, something which agents in the original position very likely might hold. 

Consider the following table:

Figure 4

This example income-to-utility conversion table demonstrates marginal utility. Levels of income are converted to their respective levels of utility. While there is a massive store of literature arguing about these values and determining which empirical study is correct is beyond both the scope of this paper and my expertise, there isn’t a consensus about the exact formula which maps financial income to utility. I’ve given a very simple example just to demonstrate what diminishing marginal utility looks like. I’m providing a theoretical point - I’m not sure what the end-game empirical tables really look like (and, honestly, I doubt anyone actually has yet). I believe the above table is not representative of reality; I think the values for diminishing marginal utility are likely far more extreme and radical. The difference between surviving and not surviving (the first couple thousand Euros) seems to have a much higher utility value than the small difference in utility gained from more luxuries. If this is true, then the table should be skewed to benefit to lowest levels of income more radically than is presented.

Essentially, this notion of diminishing marginal utility is the major portion of the bridge we’ve needed – such tables are absolutely necessary in order to connect rational utility-maximizing as a method of thinking to both the end distributive principle of justice and the basic structures selected. The weight of risk aversion in our decision procedure, at least in part, is captured by diminishing marginal utility. Worries aren’t just about catastrophic outcomes; we’re actually worried about the bottom line because it has the highest marginal utility gain. In light of Figure 4, here is what happens when we convert monetary values in Figure 1 into their corresponding utility values:

Figure 5

	In weighing the averages or totals of the corresponding utility values, values which are transformatively curved by diminishing marginal utility, it is easy to see why rational utility-maximizing agents in the original position prefer the socialized market from Figure 1. Moreover, it seems that the risk aversion theorist has a very potent argument to defend the difference principle (which is what was needed in the first place). The primitive argument from Figure 2 is correct about rational decisions being determined by averages, but the argument is wrong to assume a one-to-one correspondence of monetary to utility values. Here we see that diminishing marginal utility, which is a form of risk aversion at the low end of the utility spectrum, bridges the gap between the agents as utility-maximizers and the difference principle as a substantive distributive justice schema. 

	But, isn’t this what we set out to do? This is the story we need to hear which defends the difference principle. In recognizing that objects of distributive justice must be converted into utility values for these agents to rationally make utility-maximizing choices, in conjunction with a diminishing margin utility, the notion of risk aversion emerges to support the difference principle.
