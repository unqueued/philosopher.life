title: 2017.06.16 - Carpe Diem Log

* I keep waking up earlier than my alarm clock. This may be the alcohol. That said, I'm not taking a significant amount. I would be surprised by it. But, it may be. I don't feel sleepy though. That said, I've also been sneaking naps in on some days. That is also a plausible explanation. I woke up before 7:00 today. I fell asleep a bit after 11 last night. It isn't like I'm not getting sleep.
** I've been dreaming about pipefitting. I'm clearly in my obsession mode. Craving EQ and nothing else will fill the void. Hopefully pipefitting will.
** I feel like I've been snappier with the kids. It's been a rough week with them. I'm losing my patience and empathy. 
** I wish I could give my wife some of my sleep. She needs it more than I do. It's been hell for her. =(
* I had some fireman time, yay for morning glories. 
* I drove my wife to work. She wasn't feeling really tired. It's the least I can do. I'm glad to have those private moments with her. I don't get them often enough.
* I worked hard.
* I ate earlier than usual today. I brought a lunch when normally I wouldn't. This may or may not be a good thing. I think the eating schedule is important. I should have just brought a snack, or when I forgot that I didn't need my lunch, I should have only eaten my fruit. I made a mistake there. I like to have something to eat before tests. It makes me feel more comfortable (I've seen the studies; I also think the drug of food may just be what I'm craving too; why not both?).
* When I got home, I talked to the kids. They clearly hadn't done jackshit. I was really pissed. We talked for an hour about it. I do not have tools to motivate them. I only have reason, which is not enough. When my wife got home, we talked some more. 
** As punishment, I took control of their computers, installed myself as admin, dropped them down to standard users, wiped out software I felt would tempt them, and installed a whitelist only personal firewall. I've taken my daughter's desktop's power cords as well. They now can only access school sites. We made sure to get their messaging software up and running as well, syncs too. 
** We have to fix this problem. They absolutely must learn to work hard even when nobody is sitting there forcing them to do it.
* The kids started working. They saw how serious we were. I hope it clicks.
* I read most of //Polar Bears// the play. It's about a philosopher and his crazy/sad wife. It's a sad fucking story. I want to talk to these characters. 
* My wife and I took a nap.
* I did some surfing. 
* I wrote an article [[2017.06.16 - Computer Musings]], which I've not done in a while. The post bugged me, and the fools supporting it even more. 
** This sparked our discussion on sexism.
* I wished Uncle Charlie a happy birthday.
* We intended to swim, but the kids aren't allowed. We are going tomorrow without them if they aren't finished on time (they won't be; I know them too well). 
* We also intended to have sex (Redwings, yo!), but my wife hasn't been up to it.
** When it's that time of the month, her rationality (or willpower to be rational) decreases by 10.33 (repeating, ofc) percent (that still makes her wildly more rational than almost anyone I know). She is more emotionally and impulsively driven in those moments. That doesn't help either. She did intend to have sex, which is an emotional sacrifice for her to do for me. It's the thought that counts! =)
** I also argued about discrimination, redpilled perspectives, etc. That didn't help her libido/willingness.
*** We are worried about sexism that my daughter will experience in the computing trade. My wife has also been reading on racism lately. She's found some excellent literature.
* The family had a discussion about discrimination. It was a good one. I'm glad to see both my children participating in the debate.
* My wife and I made dinner; it was truly delicious.
** I like consuming all the remaining fresh produce in the house on Friday since we shop on Saturday. 
* We watched a Game of Thrones episode.
* I helped my son with the kitchen.
* I had some fireman time.
* I pushed my children to write. 
** My son lost his work for the 10th time. He is responsible for it. I keep showing him. I keep having him double-check. He keeps failing to follow through. His incompetence is annoying to me, and it's hurting him. I'll keep pushing him to become literate. I'll keep trying to convince him that he must do this, that it is worth his time and effort. 
* Today has been a day of lectures. Some good, some bad. It's what it is. 
** I feel like I've been the asshole dad today. You gotta do what you gotta do.
* I'm going to have some wine & watch some league.
** I didn't manage it last night, but some more fireman time might be worth it. I am horny as fuck!
