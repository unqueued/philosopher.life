My brother told me about Kyla hating him by the end. Both my brother and Rebecca were actually relieved to see her go. 

My brother is considering switching meds. Both Rebecca and I have been worried that Lexapro hasn't been working. He's on a low enough dosage for a short enough period that the physical dependence and withdrawals should be minimal.

My brother I and talked about exercising, our weight, and of our are beautiful penises.

I told him that I didn't hear back for second interview, but my wife did for the position in Japan. 

My brother isn't spending too much on cannabis. $60 a month (or better) is cheaper than I assumed. I'm glad he is able to partake. I'm hoping that will help with his transitions too.

We talked about VR, Ready Player One, pornography, and vidya. We talked about Tribes having such a high skill ceiling that people don't enjoy it (ELO doesn't work without enough players). We talked about CSGO surfing.

My brother was high as fuck, and he was hilarious. I've not heard him laugh so much for silly stuff in a long time. He even made me giggle a bunch. I'm feeling good about how he's doing.
