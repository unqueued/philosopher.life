title: 2018.09.21 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Season

!! What is your favorite season and why?

Lady Melisandre, I'm way too lazy to give you a better answer than my previous one: [[2018.01.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Fav Season]]. I would argue that I have more appearances of Seasonal Affective Disorder (so SAD) in the Fall than Spring, but I don't know if I can trust my memory here.

I'm beginning to enjoy winter more though. I love being snuggled in bed. My wife has more patience for me holding her while she sleeps when she is cold too. It puts the //win// in winter.
