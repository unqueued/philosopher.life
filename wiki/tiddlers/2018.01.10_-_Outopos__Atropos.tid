title: 2018.01.10 - Outopos: Atropos

We can push Atropos through [[WebRTC|https://webrtc.org/start/]]; p2p in browser.

We will eventually want to make a browser extension. If we ever get serious to go the Tor route, then we need our own browser.

We want to penetrate all networks. We also want to go physical mesh.
