title: 2018.11.15 - Wiki Audit: Grind

[[Philosophipolitical Prescription]] is a junkpile but still part of the [[KIN]] vs [[RPIN]] narrative that I aim to bring to light more effectively. I'm going to maintain some of my junk; I have to.

---

[[FTO Log]] is now a thing. I wasn't sure how I wanted to handle it. This should be okay.

---

[[2018.11.15 - TWGGF: Visual Reference Map]] because I want this tool. Surely someone has done this before.

---

I have not used tables in a long time. Why don't I use them more? I often find nested lists get the work done for me.

---

I struck upon my first [[Link Log]]. I can see I had no clue what to do, but I just jumped in. I can't say I know what I'm doing now, but I have a process that works better for me. I ended up dropping titles entirely. Should I have done that? I would rather engage in my reading more than writing about it. There are tradeoffs I have to consider. Hyperreading is hard to do well, and I cannot hold myself to some ridiculous standard. I already think basic cataloging and minimal commentary is well above the requirement. It is true, however, that I could do far more. I could at least entitle these links, and I could attempt to clump them together into more useful objects. This is such a tricky problem since I need to feed my mind more than my wiki when push comes to shove.

---

I am surprised that <<tag [[Retired]]>> is so empty. I see that I need to officially label [[Directory]] tiddlers to be ready for it. I want the retired snapshots internal to the wiki to be cover all the right ground. There should be no question what I will be "retiring" yearly for snapshots. Using a text editor to help me find my directories and label them. [[The Remodeling]] forces me to halt to fix problems. I am extremely worried that I will still fail to tag everything appropriately, especially since there are so many tags.

Do I tag [[Root]]? I love the idea that I would not.

This took me on a giant tagging spree through everything in [[Hub]].

---

[[Search of h0p3]] finally has a notion that I respect. My daughter and I talked about it for a bit. This seems like a reasonable approach. Perhaps I need to talk to others about this. There are some gurus I should reach out to. Bimlas is the new kid on the block, and he is clearly interested in this sphere. TonyM as well. I actually think this should be part of the core of Tiddlywiki; powerful GUI search tools where you don't have to craft the filterlist code by hand seems obvious. They already attempt to have very poor, simple versions of this in several places. Batch modifications also seem completely obvious.

---

It's clear that the [[The Remodeling]] will require that I walk through all the [[Tags]] to structure them as well. The question is when that's most appropriate.

---

I would like to point out that my wiki is starting to feel smaller to me. I don't know what it is, but I feel like I can see the hyperobject more clearly. It might be that things aren't radically changing in {[[Focus]]} anymore. I have been so busy just doing the log-based work and [[The Remodeling]] that I've not really added standard wiki content for a while. That's okay. I'm working my way towards version 3.0.
