I rearranged the room some. It buys us space. I hope my wife will consider organizing her large collections of objects. It would be worth it for her. I don't know if she has the willpower.

After struggling to get music to play on-the-fly from Spotify (does not play nice with Chromium + Linux), I did a cool project.

I did something kind of crazy. I decided to plane out half of the bed (my wife's side) to insert her hard foam mattress. I showed my kids what I was doing, measuring, drawing the lines, and cutting. I used a utility razor and a regular hand saw. I cut through two layers that were neatly stacked. I could have stopped, but her mattress would have jutted out about 1.5" still. So, I did the nasty part of cutting in the middle of a layer. It was messy as fuck. But, I got there. 

I put the Tetris mattress pieces together and voila, it fit well. Thankfully, I have basically 3 covers/sheets that bind it together. Now I can hold my wife and bug her through the night. Yay!

The cleanup was a huge pain in the ass. The cleanup took longer than the project itself, imho.

I reorganized my tools. I decided the ammo box would hold all my specialty bits and dremel gear. The measuring stuff went into the major handheld innerbox in my toolchest.

Also, my pipefitting python program looks excellent.
