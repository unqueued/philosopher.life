I made it to 40. I could feel the levels against the Throne room. I may continue to 41-42ish.

I picked up an Iceblink for my merc. Freeze is not great, but I think it's worth it here. I'll be replacing it soon enough. 

I'm going to make a 3 flawless diamond shield, I think (that's all I have). I'll lose 2 skelly levels, but it's not a huge deal to me, I think. Resists are crucial to me. I anticipate having somewhat smooth sailing through Nightmare. I could be wildly wrong. =) I really need a +1 necro amulet desperately. I don't have a Sol rune yet, so I'm still lacking +1 skill helm. Honestly, my drops have been absolutely shitty as of late.

I had an emergency Save and Exit. I was trapped while just running straight for Throne room between those minotaurs. I dropped to 60%, and I said, fuck it. I'm glad I did.

I think I'm going to push really hard for Thundergod's Belt. It looks absolutely necessary for the necro. One of the few mobs that actually own him!
