!! About:

I recall having a very strong memory beginning around this age, unfortunately, my actual memory of it is weak.<<ref "1">> I feel my long-term memory of these events fading rapidly.<<ref "2">> I'm losing these parts of myself. I feel like I'm in a race to get them out, recorded in this wiki, before they are truly gone. I want to keep my anchors and tentpegs, even if I'm not directly using them.

!! Principles:

* The narrative goes in the //Focus:// subsection.
** Second-order discussions of the content in //Focus//: will go in //About://.
* For now, just say what comes to your mind and revise/iterate over that.
* Bullet-points are encouraged; they are seeds.

!! Focus:

* My dad got a job as a pastor of a Baptist church. I don't think he appreciated that they could vote him off the Island (hence part of our move to Methodism).
* My mom was finishing school. She slept very little.
* We lived in a parsonage close by. The church was small. I remember candles and drinking a Pepsi that had cigarette ashes in it. 
* We were right next to a train station of sorts, and our next door neighbor was a conductor I believe. We got to see the inside of the train once. 
* Our neighbors were our babysitters after school. 
** I saw my first tit on a poster in their house (a young man's room that I wasn't generally allowed into). 
** I tried to make pop-tarts, but left the foil wrapper on. Sparks in a microwave.
* Another set of neighbors had two girls. They were brats.
* I remember a very serious bike accident there.
** I had serious anger issues with my bike and legos, IIRC.
* My teacher would put on lipstick and kiss kids on the lips if they misbehaved.
* I was a badass who wore shades and a Michael Jackson glove going to the chalkboard to solve math problems. I wrecked everyone, punk. ;P
* They had me do the morning announcements (which they normally didn't let first graders do).
* I remember being told not to touch any stamps in the area because someone had been lacing them with LSD. It's a damn shame I never got a hit. 
* I felt those weird chest pains at this age.
* I remember going to someone's house without permission after school. It freaked my parents out. I didn't understand why.
* There were serious parties in the lot/field in front of our house (right next to the train station) every weekend.
** Speaking of which, I've always lived at least within earshot (if not line of sight most of the time) of a train.

<<footnotes "1" "You may be asking yourself, how does he know he had a strong memory if he can't remember having one? That is a great question, and I only have memories to point me to it. I can tell you that I sometimes could recall conversations, lectures from my teacher, and  what I read 'word-for-word', although not always. I'm usually intensely visual about it. I don't know what triggered it though because it was not consistent. Sometimes I had it though.">>

<<footnotes "2" "Sometimes, I worry I'm going insane. This is a fairly normal process for my species though. Of course, that doesn't mean I'm not actually going insane, /maniacal-laugh.">>
