Thank you for your letter. It is a wonderful gift to me.
SUN 9:31 PM
I will think long and hard about your words, sir.
SUN 9:33 PM
I'm glad you appreciated it. I gotta find a hack for Ms word or just go ahead and buy it. Spell check is so handy. A i hate open office. I really like the MS office word, exel, and PowerPoint.
SUN 9:38 PM
What version you got?
SUN 9:38 PM
I don't know for sure. 2016 I think. It's a brand new laptop.

I did the one time buy on my desktop so I would have it years ago. But I hate the idea of the $99 a year for all devices when I'm the only person that uses it and occasionally. Like last night I could have just hopped on the desk top. But I was in the recliner in the living room while the girls watch the nutcracker.

I got the family a box drum and a ukelele for Christmas!
SUN 9:41 PM
Pushing 2016 pro plus and 2 KMSpico versions to you over the sync now.
