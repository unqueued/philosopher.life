!! Liberalism in Latin America

Sources:

* https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism-latin-america/

Defining the word "liberal" or "free" or "well-read" has always been difficult, and "liberalism" is no exception. It's a classic problem. Freedom is constitutive to the dialectic itself. It is extremely human to begin at this massive, well-worn labyrinthine gateway. 

I should tell you that I'm largely ignorant of Latin American history, politics, geography, culture, and so on. I've seen plenty, but my narrative of it is more holes than narrative. 

When France sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. The Roman-Romantic family of cultures doesn't live in the same house anymore, but they have the same ancient mental viruses coursing through their hiveminds.

I have to admit, I don't understand why I've not heard much of anything in political philosophy on liberalism from Latin America. I come from the analytic tradition, but I have a modicum of exposure to continental philosophy. Why not a region of the world famous for its liberalism? Theologians in the US were more concerned than philosophers. Why is that?

I can tell you that since my conversion to legal positivism, I am profoundly skeptical of anything truly normative coming out of most work on sovereignty I see. Descriptions I adore, but prescriptions I generally find lacking.

I find it interesting that religious language was so pervasive in Latin Liberalism (LL). 

My ignorance continues to show through. The divisions here are completely unknown to me, although they make plenty of sense.

I worry that I have an Orientalist perspective about too many things in a sense, Africa and Latin America included. These are huge regions on the Earth, not monolithic, and the issues are too complex for me to make strong claims about in many cases.

This makes more sense of the bits and pieces I've picked up over the years and the people I've met. 

The article here surprises me by its use of Positivism. They mean in the epistemic sense (more along the lines of Logical Positivism, etc.). 

I'm so used to individualism and libertarianism in my society that it is interesting to see the emphasis on the societal organism, of corporate (metaphysical) ontologies. It's a different frame of mind. I'm pretty reductive too. 

Sadly, I have little or nothing of substance to say here.
