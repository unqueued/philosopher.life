title: Spinoza on Reason

```
Alright, so I need to say: "[[The Infinite]] is self-explaining and self-justifying. The casual reason for everything is explained through it. Agential power, however, requires justification in a way that the rest of finite reality does not."
THU 2:54 PM
Why should I agree with Spinoza that each finite thing is, like God, a reason for its own existence?
THU 2:55 PM
"a mode of extension and the idea of that mode is one and the same thing but expressed two ways" -- I see no reason to agree to this unifying claim, though I'm hard-pressed to give evidence against it.
THU 3:31 PM
Spinoza sees necessity even in the mere appearance of possibility. I think possibility is real.
THU 3:31 PM
There's something quite beautiful to the claim they are unified though.
THU 3:32 PM
It seems so reasonable to say the idea of a thing is external to it as well though. I want to be essentialist about collections of objects, but with modal realism, Spinoza can buy himself anything.
THU 3:36 PM
It's weird that he attempts for dualism though. That doesn't feel right about his theory to me.
THU 3:37 PM
I'm slow to accept the instantiation of a possible world as some alternate state of affairs which obtains in the unified multiverse.
THU 3:41 PM
I simply don't know.
THU 3:41 PM
I'm not in a position to accept or deny it.
THU 3:42 PM
I agree the ideas of everything exist in [[The Infinite]].
THU 3:43 PM
I have a tendency to read dual modes as appearances of unified substance on the approach Spinoza wants to give. If I have to pick a side, Spinoza feels idealist to me. Mind appears more capable of explaining matter than the other way.
THU 3:48 PM
Rocca's claim that "the nature of each thing consists, at least in part, in the thing's available to thought" does point to idealism. Without being an idealist, I can say the corresponding concept of a thing can be understood without my mind "touching" the instantiated object. I'm afraid we are in Ontological Proof territory again, and the question is whether or not "existence" is a better making property of a thing.
THU 3:58 PM
If Spinoza's thing-in-itself is graspable by just any sufficient mind by definition, then maybe it is an idealist position.
THU 3:59 PM
I can also say that Spinoza's philosophical kin and lineage are often devout idealists.
THU 4:17 PM
I'm surprised by the author's interpretations of Curley and Rocca though. Now I want to push back. It's not just that idealism only works insofar as anything can be understood, but rather it's existence depends upon something understanding it. That's how far idealism really really goes to me.
THU 4:25 PM
Spinoza's absurdly beautiful model appears capable of this as well.
THU 4:25 PM
Hegel is doing that hardcore.
THU 4:25 PM
His henosis is so hardcore. My God. Exactly.
THU 4:37 PM
I am, ofc, a huge fan of the PoSR.
THU 4:38 PM
"God on Spinoza's account is all of being and the thought of all of being." Yup, that's Spinoza alright. Is there a way to save this grandmaster from the modal collapse? Can I preserve possibility for him?
THU 4:44 PM
It's fascinating to say I'm part of God, but God is the whole, right? The author is not being careful enough, possibly. The wording is just off.
THU 5:07 PM
"By 'God' I understand a being absolutely infinite, i.e., a substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses an eternal and infinite essence. Exp. I say absolutely infinite, not in its own kind. For whatever is infinite in its own kind only, we can deny infinite attributes of it... what however is absolutely infinite, everything that expresses essence and involves no negation pertains to its essence."
THU 5:09 PM
Preach, yo!
THU 5:09 PM
That I cannot deny.
THU 5:09 PM
I am forever indebted to you, [[Saint Spinoza]].
THU 5:10 PM
It is part of the Ontological Argument to me. There is 'isness.' It is a blinding sun of everything. It may be ineffable to the [[fff]] to some infinite [[dok]].
THU 5:15 PM
The problem, ofc, is that it traps us into speaking of non-being as conceptually unthinkable itself.
THU 5:15 PM
Or, so our language game appears to play out
THU 5:15 PM
Perhaps Non-Beingness's being exists only virtue of Being [[Itself]]. But, I'm afraid I'm speaking gibberish. I don't know what to do at this level in fundamental philosophy.
THU 5:18 PM
We are in [[Dialetheia]] territory, obviously.
THU 5:22 PM
It's hard to speak of the absolutely infinite. Spinoza is a rockstar.
THU 5:24 PM
```

```
"There is in God the thought of my body //and// another thought of my correlate in the third attribute //and// yet another thought of my correlate in the fourth attribute and so on. There are therefore as many different thoughts as there are modes of all other attributes." I am in no position to deny this claim. That looks right to me.
1 HR AGO
I agree to the [[infinigress]]  of the ideal.
59 MIN AGO
Platonism leaves no stone unturned and no possible thought uncovered.
58 MIN AGO
The claim that "the order and connections of ideas is the same as the order of things," however, is not obviously correct whatsoever to the Platonist.
54 MIN AGO
I agree that the ideas are necessary for the things, but not the things for the ideas. Further, that one thing obtains does not necessitate that all things obtain, even if it necessitates that all ideas obtain.
53 MIN AGO
So, I can agree "there is an idea of the human body that occupies, in the order of ideas,  [a correlated] place that the body occupies in the order of bodies," rather than "the same place." Spinoza is in no position to deny me this possibility.
46 MIN AGO
I adore his attempt to collapse idealism and realism, but it comes with a complete modal collapse.

It's not clear to me that fatalism is an autonomy defeater, even as an incompatibilist. If we de-necessitate an aspect of Spinoza's view by peeling apart mind and body back into dualism, I also think there is room for freewill on his view (which is clearly anti-thetical to his view).

```
Is Spinoza split? Is he after the same problem? It's not hard to reason your way to [[The Foundation]]. But, it's difficult to talk about any other self-explaining (PoSR, but not self-justifying) separate objects, especially finite objects.
6 HR AGO
On top of that henosis, I think he may have aimed for some kind of dualism, one which differentiates humanity. There appear to be hints.
6 HR AGO
He wants humans to be reasons for themselves in a similar way to God being a reason for itself. The problem is that we are finite. What can we ever do about the [[infinigress]]? I don't know how to explain freedom either, bud, but it looks like unmoved mover territory to me.
6 HR AGO
My conjecture is that there are infinite options available to our freedom, and hence our transworld identities have infinite structures to them.
6 HR AGO
It's still dependent though, but there's no reason we have to say it can't be free. It's coming into being was not up to it, but afterward, it appears to have some choices (I'll also point out that infinite choices doesn't mean just any choices).
6 HR AGO
It looks like there are multiple orders of substance, but I'm not sure Spinoza is allowed to have his cake and eat it too. I hope so.
6 HR AGO
At least not on the definition he has given.
6 HR AGO
"Each of us requires what impedes our existence to be removed, and that removal is the immediate cause of our existence." - seems to be the answer for all finite objects.
5 HR AGO
Yeah, I'm in deep shit. As I have worried before, I simply don't know how to talk about contingency arising from necessity. I don't know how to escape the necessitarian vortex.
5 HR AGO
What if we go for time? Contingency means it could possibly be otherwise (might have to concede some anti-fatalism ground), and we can talk about a necessary regress up until the present. Well, we could just have contingent chains that lead to the necessary. The real humdinger is always the move from necessary cause to contingent effect.
5 HR AGO
Okay, take Contingent Object, C, can there be a necessary cause of it which doesn't make C's entire identity necessary?
5 HR AGO
Make C a random number generator. Now, we don't get to cheat and have it be pseudorandom. Does C exist outside of [[The Infinite]]? For Spinoza, obviously not. For contingency, it appears so.
5 HR AGO
The entire structure of all contingencies is necessary! That is what logical possibility requires.
5 HR AGO
Contingency is wrapped by necessity.
5 HR AGO
Computed by necessity.
5 HR AGO
Reminds me of the claim that time is an illusion.
5 HR AGO
I don't think time is an illusion when I'm in this space.
5 HR AGO
I mean, I'm open to the claim at a level of pure skepticism. Carnap it.
5 HR AGO
It's neat that some quantum mechanics appear to show quantum particles travel down multiple paths.

3p6: Each thing, insofar as it is in itself, strives to persevere in its own being.
3p7: The striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being is nothing other than the actual essence of the thing.
<<<

I think I agree entirely. It's how we define what the thing is. If we attempt to reduce it's being, we lose particulars that distinguish it from other modalities of its (perhaps recursive) parallels in its transworld identity. As contingents, we obtain as a single thread of that larger transworld identity. The particulars are fundamental to the essence. Particulars are essences. Yes, Saint Aristotle. Insofar as particulars form an emergent essence, the emergent essence is in virtue of its particulars, and so on. 

"Striving" is a word I normally attach to agency. It doesn't have to be, though it can be the "will to [[power]]." In fact, this is very much dialectics and [[power]]. The power of being one's particular essence.

I cannot speak to a difference between uncaused and self-caused. One cannot know, right?

//create sive conservare//, "create or preserve," are similar. Preserving a thing is clearly a power-over. If you do not deconstruct the thing, then you are part of its construction in the dialectic?

The Ontological Proof from G1 164 through G1 165 is correct, but that's what the PSR buys you too. When you conflate the perception of [[The Good]] with causation, ontology and epistemology, you're going to find the same process. There is a positive thing which is self-caused. Unfortunately, I don't know how to defeat the modal collapse. All contingency is real? Oof. I cannot say either way, so maybe I shouldn't have a problem. My contingency arises out of that necessity as less real thread. The reality of the necessity is built on some less real things? Maybe. This DOES look like a spaghetti monster, and the neo-Platonic and scholastic perspective of reality and perfection continues.

<<<
1A4: The knowledge of an effect depends on, and involves, the knowledge of its cause.
<<<

Indeed! To know a thing is to know the explanation and justification. Without a causal history, you do not have the particular essence in your mind but only a semblance. Of course, it is infeasible to have the thing-in-itself in mind for we the [[fff]]. It is but on faith that we take it that our semblances resemble and furthermore have a causal link to the thing-in-itself. I'll take it. That's what my empiricism for, daddy.

---

God damn this book is hard to read. Every other paragraph and page, I have to stop to wrestle all the way down. It's exhausting. 

Alright, so I'm not in a position to deny Pantheism. Insofar as I am the result of external processes, yes. What is left at best is just my qualia, my individual irreducible perspective from my specific causes as a particular. To say my freewill just is the divine's sounds absurd to me. Spinoza hasn't broken me yet. I have a hard time denying that finite things are expressions of [[The Infinite]].

---

I agree Spinoza's theomorphism is different from the tradition we find in Leibniz, Decartes, and well before. Pantheism does that. However, I'm not sure if the imago dei exceptionalism can't also be part of pantheism, and Hegel may even be going that direction.

---

Whoa, whoa, whoa: why should I think we can have a perfect understanding of the Pythagorean theory? What it is is a part of that giant necessity ball. You can peel it out, but the implications and relations are part of what makes it what it is. I see Spinoza's [[fff]] adequacy as only making sense in virtue of the contextualized [[Right]]. Otherwise, it is inadequate by definition of the ideal (though he thinks all is ideal). 

2P12 is idealism. Unmistakable to me. Though, it could just be God's mind, and our mind part of It's mind, etc. 

This book is dropping off for me. The opening problem is the most intensely interesting.
