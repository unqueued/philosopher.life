!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Socialism is a scareword they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people.

Yummy. I'll be your C student and gudboi any day, Mr. President. To have a living member of SCOTUS or Congress or POTUS utter these words today is Orwellianly unthinkable. Your grandchildren's generation turned out to be a piece of shit, btw. Oddly enough, while I can't say anything like this to almost anyone in my area, it is possible to scream you words into the void of the interwebs, quietly utter this with subversives, or even march in some cities. 

I agree "socialism" is a scareword, but it is not hurled at every advance. To be clear, there are some kinds of progress which benefit both the capitalist and the socialist projects. 

The public does have [[power]], but, on average, it's wielded for the sake of capitalism. Collectively, the vast majority of people enable the elite to rule all of us. I appreciate the sentiment of the phrase, but it's also necessary to recognize that even public [[power]] can suffer the various paradoxes of democracy voting for tyranny, enslavement, unjustified distributions of [[power]], and so forth.

Social security is a safety net bandaid fugly hack that shouldn't exist anymore. We've built society incorrectly. My enemies call it socialism to distract us from what actually counts as socialism. It's a sophistic false compromise in [[naming]]. 

Farm price supports and various subsidies in agriculture generally exist as legislative pork, abusing gerrymandered districts, a result of lobbying, and a form of defense spending to make sure the United States isn't absolutely dependent upon any other nation for survival. I agree that helping the person working with their hands for a living is maximin our goal. Note, of course, socialism applies globally, not just nationally or locally: otherwise, you've not escaped capitalism whatsoever (you've simply built [[T42T]]esque cooperation inside a corporation which sublates and enslaves everything else outside).

Bank deposit insurance is this tiny step in the right direction. Finance owns us (even companies like Apple have become huge finance corps, buying up debt, and so forth). That is still mere neoliberal regulation of capitalism; it's not socialism.

The growth of labor organizations are crucial hacks in capitalism, fighting on capitalist terms. The GNU license has this problem in IP; it cleverly abuses the law to attempt to fight back. Yes, it is socialist, but the goal is still to eliminate the implementation of IP entirely (which should have been done back when you were le prez).

Your conclusion is sadly correct, but I'm not convinced you know what socialism means, sir. I barely do. These words appear to strike out in the correct direction in the desert though.
