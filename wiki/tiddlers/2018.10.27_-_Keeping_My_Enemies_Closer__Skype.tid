title: 2018.10.27 - Keeping My Enemies Closer: Skype

My children called their granddonors back after my wife and I repeatedly asked them to do so (we've also asked them to write thank you letters for the winter hat gifts).

Afterward, my daughter said they asked an odd question.

You can give us three answers to this question: "yes," "no," or "we're not allowed to talk about it." -- Can you install Skype?

Wow. Somehow, I am still surprised by it even when I predict this route. Unless I'm mistaken, it appears they keep digging themselves deeper into this hole. I think they aim to paint a false picture for my children in which I've prevented my donors from contacting my children. That is clearly false, and my children know it. When [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] attempt to implant this false doubt and my children see the tactic for what it is, their gaslighting plan backfires. 

It is true: there are limitations on contact in person, though we have worked to enable that as well. I actively encourage e-mails, SMS, phone calls, video chat, instant messaging, etc. It's true that Skype is not software I respect, but I use plenty of software I don't respect (even though I try to use alternatives).

I don't think a relationship with these narcissists is good for my children, but as I've stated before, my best option here is to not prevent the relationship. I keep my hands clean. I am still convinced that my donors won't put in the time, and that lack of effort in communication will do all the talking in the end. I continue to encourage my children to maintain the tie because, as I've said, I think that's exactly what will expose [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] for who they are to my children. Contacting my children once every couple months is not actually trying to maintain a relationship. I think they want to find a way to blame their choice not to be in my children's lives on me. I've made that tactic quite clear. Again, I am grateful to have my wiki as an open record of this.

My daughter told them the truth: they recently had limited access to their devices because they aren't doing well enough in their schoolwork, but they can install Skype.
