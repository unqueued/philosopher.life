!! Describe your best childhood friend.

I have answered this question before: [[2018.03.31 - Prompted Introspection Log: Childhood Friend]]. A year later, I agree with my previous assessment. It's clear to me that [[JRE]] is the only childhood friend that has stood the test of time. 

It's not easy to get to know me, and having known me from childhood should help; it does in this case. After my brother's divorce, I've consistently reached out to him. Excepting the fact that my phone holds the keys to my life, my brother is the only reason I really care about my phone. Unfortunately, I'm forced to have [[smalltalk]] with almost everyone I meet or know. Of course, I talk about bullshit with my brother too, but we also talk about what matters. I treasure it.
