There aren't good Remote Torrent adders for FF and Deluge. Those that claim to work do not. There are several that work in Chrome. I'm very disappointed. Going with a watch folder synced instead. Unfortunately, FF also lacks any sort of easy to use Downloads/Filetype sorting extension. The Firefox Apocalypse destroyed anything that was viable (which wasn't much to begin with). I'm now resorting to crontab:

`* * * * * mv /home/h0p3/Downloads/*.torrent /home/h0p3/Downloads/Kimsufi-Watch`
