title: ARAM: Morgana

* Summoners
** Flash
** Snowball - Clarity is quite strong on her, but Morellonomicon does the job.
* Build
** Items
*** Start
**** Catalyst of Aeons
**** Refillable Potion
*** General Build
**** Rod of Ages - Hard to beat. With her passive and Rod, she is very strong in trades.
**** Sorcerer's Shoes - MR is ubiquitous 
**** Morellonomicon - All around solid stats. 
**** Zhonya's Hourglass - Sick with her ult. It's strong enough on her, given the way her ult works, that even if isn't AD damage on their team, you may still want it.
**** Banshee's Veil - Both offensive and defensive stats. 
**** Rabadon's Deathcap or Void Staff - Depends on the enemy team.
