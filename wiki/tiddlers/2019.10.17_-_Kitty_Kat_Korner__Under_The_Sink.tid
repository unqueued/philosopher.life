title: 2019.10.17 - Kitty Kat Korner: Under The Sink

Ranga was underneath the sink. I've seen him dart in and out before out of curiosity, but he has never, to my knowledge, actually spent time in there. I was surprised to find an animal there. I like how he opens doors.

The bathroom had no lights on, and that spot is exceptionally dark. He wanted to be alone, I take it. I didn't want to move him, so I asked for toilet paper from upstairs instead.

Compared to our usual 80 degree Halloween weather, we've experienced a coldsnap. Maybe he is cold. That spot would be fairly warm, but it would not be as warm as under my bed. The offspring have done their laundry, so he can't sleep in that. Their beds are on safely (for him) high, he likes blankets, and that is more his usual. Why this place?

Maybe he is feeling sick. The neighbors have clearly been feeding him. He has puked multiple times in the past month. 

I do not know what feeling causes him to be under the sink.
