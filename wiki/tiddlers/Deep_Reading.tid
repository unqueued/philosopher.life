title: Deep Reading

!! About:

//Hell or heaven, dive in. Take the risk, pay the price, and experience these virtual worlds. Don't give in to being a lazy fucking hedonic idiot, and be honest about the fact that you don't want to try. Suffering builds character. It won't hurt to be in pain for a while, right? Never deny yourself the opportunity to read sources deeply (or at all). How many times must you learn this lesson? It's a damned shame, I tell ye'hwhat. Do your best, sir.//

<<<
Tell me how you read and I'll tell you who you are.

-- Martin Heidegger 
<<<

<<<
To read without reflecting is like eating without digesting.

-- Edmund Burke

<<<
We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.

-- Robin Sharma, //The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari//

Welcome to my treasury of marginalia and stream-of-conscious<<ref "s">> reading digestion wherein I retardedly reckon with external long-form narratives or hyperread about them. May I one day become proud of this directory. I want to become the Bookie-Monster.

I'm constantly preaching the //Liber// gospel of books and freedom to my chillun. [[You Think It's A GAME!|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OchyYnlHTdo]]?<<ref "g">> Even if only for them (and obviously it's not just for them), I need to practice what I preach to have the right to say "do as I do" rather than "do as I say, not as I do." I must fight to avoid the blissful shackles of hypocritical ignorance and tsundoku signaling.<<ref "f">> Literacy is a practice of classical leisure for a reason. Here I document my progress in deepreading sources of any kind. I generally deepread books, but there are some hypertext rabbitholes which merit the same [[dok]] of charity, empathy, and extensive scrutiny.<<ref "h">>

My illiteracies are a source of shame. I have to take a deep breath and remind myself that (1) my verbal reasoning is autistically poor in unexpected ways, and (2) my public schools were among the poorest of the second to last ranked state (at the time).<<ref "t">> I learned alongside the truly poor in what were (and still are) essentially the third world boonies; a lot of kids only had meals at school.<<ref "p">> I have done well for myself with what I had, especially as an autist. I have made progress before, and I [[hope]] to do it again.

Do what you can, homie. Enjoy what you can. Maybe you can't fix your stupidity, but you gotta try. You may never be well-read, but that doesn't matter. Spend the rest of your life earning your own approval in this practice. Like all humans, you deserve to be a literate man. Seize it! Throw yourself into the depths of Humanity. You are not alone.

!! Principles:

* Transclude where appropriate.
* Read with your family, and keep an annual log in //Focus://
* ~~Pix~~ Write or it didn't happen.
* Destroy the sunk cost fallacy; aggressively put down your reading sources if they aren't worth reading without confabulation. 
* Curate and scale your investigations and digestions appropriately.
* Wear your [[Straussian]], Montaignian, and other hermeneutical+motivational hats where appropriate.
