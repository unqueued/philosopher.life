title: 2019.01.05 - Wiki Audit: TW-Navigator

Well, drunk me failed to get the new KeeBoord, TW-Navigator, to work. I've still not tried in singlefile mode yet. I'm worried I'm going to hit a CSS-roadblock. I may need to get help from BTC himself. I want it!

Something has changed after the node and Bob upgrades. We are able to spawn far too many processes with our normal setup.

[[Search Title Tagger]] has been useful again. It's not as strong a tool, but it actually works!

I think I've solved the [[Polymath Craftsman]] problem. Also [[Reddit Theory & Practice]] got set (I need to do an update).

I stopped at [[2018.01.06 - Reddit: First]] in [[The Remodeling]]. Can I catch up to my current logs in the next two months? Maybe. By 2018, my log keeping started to have more rhyme and reason to it.
