title: Applied Computational Existentialism

//I hope to live in my art. It's lifecrafting.//

Applied Computational Existential is the anti-luck scientific method loaded with a profound respect for metaphysics applied to my fundamental existential context. It is the search for the universal context and my place in it.

The fundamental progressive wiki data_structure+algorithm building block can be understood in:

* About, Principles, Focus, Vault, and Dreams, including all the way down to the [[Root]] project: {[[About]]}, {[[Principles]]}, {[[Focus]]}, {[[Vault]]}, and {[[Dreams]]}.
* The function which emerges from these 5 functions is the empirical existential work towards enriching metaphysics in [[Self-Dialectic]].
* It's about safely and efficiently learning to write leet multi-threaded philosophical Rust to build towards [[The Good]], [[The Right]], and [[The Grand Dialectic]].

The goal is to balance my self-dialectic with empirical bottom-up reasoning and rationalist top-down modeling from a transcendental realist's position in epistemology and ontology, i.e. be maximally both qualitatively quantitatively [empirically rational] and frontal-lobe-(regulated+trained) intuitionistically [rationally empirical]. I must balance the present-at-hand vs. ready-to-hand in [[Self-Dialectic]].

This is an assay in teleology based on the assumption that the physical world and my mind are almost entirely reducible to computational models while humbly accepting that both the initial origins and final telos of reality meaningfully exists in metaphysics.
