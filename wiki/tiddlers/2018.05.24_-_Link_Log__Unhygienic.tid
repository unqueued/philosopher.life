* Stunning!

*** I think it's gorgeous. 
*** The metacognition in infants is interesting. It reminds me of when we first see children distinguish moral norms from mere social conventions at 16ish months. Communicating uncertainty is fascinating.
*** Admittedly, their argument only shows the necessary functions for consciousness (the what it's like qualia, etc.), but cannot point out what is sufficient (and likely cannot by definition). I'm going to make the leap of faith and say it is another mind, not some mere p-zombie.

*** We are animals.
*** His attempt at moderation, the middle way, and argument against "Communism" (which he obviously can't define) is fairly poor. He gets a lot right, but his claim to being a "conscientious objector to the culture war" is an anti-intellectual copout designed to conveniently remove his culpability or the necessity of actually fixing anything. It's like he pointed at the dialectic and then denies the necessity of engaging in it.

*** Absolute riot. Always astute, I suggest this is very close to the ontological argument as well, which they are not pointing at here, imho.
