*** You gotta have rule of law and consolidated power, but the means for building it must be decentralized (and continously redistributed). I suggest [[T42T]] sharding defeats sybil attack. Consensus can be gunkier. We still have to build large structures together though. It can't be pure indie.

* Think About It

*** It can't stay up forever. I think most of the hardware shifts are still toward the centralization of computation in data centers. Specialized hardware cannot be afforded by consumers. We have thin clients to our identities. That said, I think phones still have a ton of room to grow. I can hope for GNU/Linux, right?

*** Say it with me now: In ~~Russia~~ socialism, the people own the means of production. Self-perpetuating decentralization of power which meets the maximin principle is all we can justify.

*** Oh, please, allow me to cast the first stone, WaPo. I can agree to the argument, but I suggest your motivation is something else. I suppose controlling the populace is a trade secret, right?
