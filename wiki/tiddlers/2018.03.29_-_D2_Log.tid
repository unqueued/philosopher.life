I'm almost halfway into 90. 1.5 levels to go, and then I can gamble for +2 ammies. The going is very slow. 

I continue to hone my baal runs. The gargoyle (second to last) wave, I am careful to only CE 2-3 times at most, since I need that fodder for the final wave. Essentially, I need those corpses to down the last wave in any reasonable space of time. When I'm lucky, it downs them almost instantly; usually it speeds it up by a minute or two; when I'm lucky, I don't have corpses, and they have the right mods to make it as slow as downing Baal himself. Positioning with teleport doesn't seem to help much in many cases.

I've also got my summoning down. You should see the map I have. It's just gorgeous. I could roll a few hundred times and not find a better one.
