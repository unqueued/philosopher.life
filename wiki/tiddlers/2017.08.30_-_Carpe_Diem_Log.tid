title: 2017.08.30 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke before the alarm.
* Listened to Gladwell's revisionist //Revisionist History//
** Talked to my fam, mostly ALM and k0sh3k
* Called MB, JRE, AIR, L, and Charlie. None answered at first. Charlie called me back.
* Talked to Charlie for a while.
** I love that man.
* Pizza for dinner. 
* Opened my tools, prepped my gear for tomorrow.
** Realized I need anti-rust oil for my tools. It's a shame to have nice tools and have them go bad. This is insurance. 
* Fireman Time!
* Waited for my wife, then bed.
