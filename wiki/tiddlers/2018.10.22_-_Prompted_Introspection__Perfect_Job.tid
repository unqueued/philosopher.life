title: 2018.10.22 - Prompted Introspection: Perfect Job

!! Describe your perfect career or job. Where would it be? Would you want financial or personal fulfillment? What kind of people would you work with?

Melisandre, you come bearing gifts yet again (and not just 'dem tiddies). My perfect job is in a perfect world where everything is ideal, we're all maximally happy, etc. I do not know what the perfect job in this world would be. I think building my wiki is actually awesome as all get out. I'd love to get paid to do that.

I want both kinds of fulfillment, but if I can only have one, obviously personal.

I'd prefer not to work with people unless I'm writing to them (and even then...).
