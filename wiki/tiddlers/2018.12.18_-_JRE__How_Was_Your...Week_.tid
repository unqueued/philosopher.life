How was your day?
MON 7:52 PM
How was your day?
TUE 5:20 PM
Used a bunch of hot pepper powder on my food, poopin fire now
TUE 5:24 PM
You?
TUE 5:24 PM
Lol.
TUE 5:25 PM
I wonder why our assholes  are sensitive to capsaicin.
TUE 5:26 PM
Still, likely worth it
TUE 5:27 PM
Weirdly, the pepper powder labelled "devil dust" didnt seem that hot on my food
TUE 5:28 PM
I'm fine. Music, dancing, and basketball. Gym is fine. Messaging m10 over XMPP.
TUE 5:28 PM
So does my butthole have more capsaicin sensors than my tongue?
TUE 5:29 PM
I don't believe so.
TUE 5:29 PM
Time for science.
TUE 5:29 PM
Although that is self reporting on the phenomenology rather than quantifying an answwr.
TUE 5:30 PM
One teaspoon ought to do it. Run it in well.
TUE 5:31 PM
Rub* autocorrect.
TUE 5:31 PM
Either way.
TUE 5:31 PM
Run it in sounds worse
TUE 5:33 PM
Lol.
TUE 5:34 PM
Electric toothbrush brush can make it more pleasant. Just need to hit that button.
TUE 5:34 PM
For the sake of scientific accuracy, might need to use the same toothbrush to rub it on your tongue and butthole.  Eliminate some variables
TUE 5:35 PM
Trufe
TUE 5:36 PM
Watch short animation bao
TUE 5:37 PM
Googling

Pronounced like the sailorman
TUE 5:47 PM
I know nothing about it, but have you ever seen Sick Note?
TUE 5:49 PM
Saw one episode
TUE 5:49 PM
I assume not worth.
TUE 5:50 PM
Maybe not even a full episode
TUE 5:50 PM
