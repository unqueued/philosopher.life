title: 2019.04.19 - Prompted Introspection: Childhood Story

!! Tell one of your favorite childhood stories.

The Elkhorn parsonage was my donor's office. It was unpleasant and barren for us, but we were taken there often enough in the summer. My brother [[JRE]] and I rollerbladed in the basement, and then fell asleep on the mattresses (with blankets). Our donors couldn't find us, and we didn't hear their call as we were asleep. They were starting to form search parties to dredge the river nearby, but then my female donor came down one more time to call us. I answered, she screamed, and we went the fishfry without our shirts. That's fine. I caught frogs.
