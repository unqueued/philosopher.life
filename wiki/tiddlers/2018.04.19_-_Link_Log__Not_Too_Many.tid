*** Thielology, lol!
*** Straussian gnosticism is dangerous! I appreciate charity insofar as it elucidates that which can and should be known by all. This is disgusting. KYS!!

*** Again with Thiel. Okay, it's time to admit Bloomberg is closer to my side than I thought before. Sometimes, they are pointing to a very serious problem.

* Fishy

*** And...you still dance the issue of socialism, like it can't really be taken seriously, like that's not what we should be going after, as though the DNC needs to fight for another option.

** http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/
*** A tithe, of course. Unfortunately, the neo-rational (i.e. new empiricists, lol) community are really just trying to justify with libertarian selfishness at any cost. I don't buy it.
