title: 2019.02.24 - Wiki Review: Backpat

* [[Tentpeg Icons, Archetypes, and Mythology]]
** Perhaps I will be able to extract something out of Jung here. I need metaphor, symbols, and pointing. There's no way around it.
* [[2019.02.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Voluntarity]]
** Edited.
** This log does a fuckton of work. I wish I had been doing it all along.
* [[2019.02.23 - Prompted Introspection: Culture Clash]]
** Edited. 
** I could have said more. It's okay that I keep it short.
* [[Phenomenology]]
** Oh Jesus. This is going to be a monster. It's not just technical, but it's specified to my other {[[axiom]]}s. Like [[The Good]], it will probably need to be revised many times. It's a very hard problem.
* [[Cognitive Hacking]]
** Wrong name. I don't know what to call it.
* [[The Ol' Yeller Clause]]
** Worth fleshing out. I'm in the torrent of 10,000 things right now though.
* [[The Dialectic]]
** Hello, seedling. May you become an epic rhizome inside me!
* [[2019.02.23 - Trove Yapok: Awesome. Hello.]]
** I'm still concerned I'm being trolled here. I hope I am proven wrong! I'd much prefer to not be so cynical.
* [[2019.02.23 - Wiki Audit: Moar TW5N]]
** Maybe I'm retarded. It's okay. `/backpat`
* [[2019.02.23 - Wiki Review: Motte]]
** And a good day to you, Kevin! Thank you for the response. I think you are right.
* [[2019.02.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Saturday]]
** Completed.
** It was a productive day.
* [[2019.02.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Oops In My Base]]
** I regret these failures. They shouldn't be happening.
* [[2019.02.23 - TDL: My Family]]
** Oh yeah, we did taxes.
* [[2019.02.22 - TDL: Tax]]
** Shame, sir! Shaaaame! =)
