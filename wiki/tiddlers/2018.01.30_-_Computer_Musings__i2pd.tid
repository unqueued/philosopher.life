I'm failing to get i2pd to actually compile. Ugh. I can't test it this way. I tried extracting the binary and configs from other installers, but I found I lack the correct libraries. This is the wrong back. I'm going the Docker route now.<<ref "2019.03.24">>

I've found two i2pd docker images.

* https://github.com/hexaedron/i2pd-docker
* https://hub.docker.com/r/purplei2p/i2pd/

Installed on ATL (from deb) and KS (docker)
