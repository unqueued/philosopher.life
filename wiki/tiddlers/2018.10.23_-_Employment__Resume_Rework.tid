title: 2018.10.23 - Employment: Resume Rework

So, my resume needed to be reworked. I'm shotgunning, so it needs to just be general. I have no problem with my blue collar work, but I think it reflects poorly on me in front of others. It is better to say I'm a homemaker who is homeschooling his children in many contexts. I obviously enjoy learning and teaching.

I've removed my blue collar work from my work experience, though I'm keeping it in my skills section. Not sure if this is a wise move. I've regeneralized my resume.
