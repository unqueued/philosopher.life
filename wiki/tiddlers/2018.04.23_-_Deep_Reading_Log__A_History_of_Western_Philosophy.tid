title: 2018.04.23 - Deep Reading Log: A History of Western Philosophy

Backtracking a bit. I lost my place. I don't mind though. This is the kind of book that is worth reading more than once.

The historical context is very neatly packed into the philosophical views. I'm very pleased to read this. I liked the intro the philosophy class I taught, and for the shitty students I had, it was good enough. I wish I had worked Sophie's World and this book into my curriculum. They couldn't be better introductions, I think.

As usual, I am continually impressed by the ancients again and again. I'm sad to see that we haven't made much headway in philosophy in some respects. They saw very far, and I feel blind compared to them in my own context.

Russell is absurdly well-read. I'm not sure I could even hope to accomplish what he has.

Plato of Plotinus and Parmenides...

The One, Spirit, and Soul...Trinity. The One is supreme, then spirit, and soul last. The One is shadowy, sometimes called God or The Good, transcends Being, the first sequent? Can't attribute predicates. Can only say "it is" like Parmenides. Not the "All" because it transcends the all, and it is present through all things. Present without an becoming. Precedes the Good and the Beautiful? Resembles Aristotle's God. Indefinable, and more truth in silence than in words whatsoever.
