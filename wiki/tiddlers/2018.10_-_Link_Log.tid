!! Audit:

* This was the most sane month of [[Link Log]] that I can remember. Sure, I got up to hundreds, but I didn't feel overly overburdened by it. My addiction is under control, right? AMIRIGHT? Lol.
* I should add that I've had a lot of other projects floating around in my Web workspace. It's been nice. This is also the first time I've used multiple browsers in that space. I do aim to avoid it, but it turned out to be useful more than once.
* I've been noticing that I will load https://philosopher.life/ in FFDE very often to work on a particular project, e.g. [[Music Exploration]]. Hell, the kids are regularly loading up my wiki from sync or site to get stuff too. That's pretty fuckin' sweet. I hope this is is just the tip of the iceberg here.
* I'm considering adding web consoles/etc. Like, why not go full fucking bookmark bar here? 
** I have a {[[Dream]]}.
* I rarely have anything to say in //Confirm My Bias//. Cool. That's what it is.
* I regret that I have so much to send my daughter, but so little for my son. I keep looking, but I am failing. I think a lot of what my son likes belongs elsewhere. This is another reason I would want to tag.
* I'm glad that I clear out browsers that are filled, accidentially, with content they shouldn't have. My goal is very window oriented. I consider this a flaw in FF's control flow (despite the options).
