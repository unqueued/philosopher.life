title: Doctor's Unions

I'm always surprised that we don't see Doctors fighting back against insurance companies in a radical way. They have the money, time, power, and even connections to have unique political and economic tools to fight back.

Why not have a consortium of Doctors, hardware and logistics providers, etc. who you literally pay directly. Pay them yearly insurance. Have access to the hospital be free. If you need help, you get it, and in a timely manner. Set performance minimums that are sensible. Then set prices. Make it transparent. Legally harden what it does and ensuring the difficulty of infecting it or forcing it out of the world. Basically, community owned and operated medical facilities are completely possible. If the government won't do it, we could at least allow the free market to push for it (that that the free market is the best of the options).
