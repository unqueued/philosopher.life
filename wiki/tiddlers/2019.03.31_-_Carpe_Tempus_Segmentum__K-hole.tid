title: 2019.03.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: K-hole

* Woke at 8:30
* medfirestretch
* 20mg DCKetamine
** K-hole. It wasn't bad though. It was hard work as usual, but it felt like lucid dreaming states to some extent. I embraced the crazy, I felt the harmony of disunity, I went with the flow, and I didn't attempt to break out of the bubble to write down thoughts or articulate what I was feeling. I just did my work beneath the surface, and it's okay that it is lost. I remember it like a deafening silent movie where my innervoice never leaves the membrane. It is all circuitry, machinescapes, and fractals.
** It was the most pleasant (however incredibly intense, dissociating, and disorienting) k-hole I've ever experienced. It went much better that I did not fight for my consciousness. I felt like a mostly powerless stoic observer assenting and passing over and through it. It was a powerful experience.
* Family came home toward the end. I left my sleepmask on. I processed with my wife for a long time.
* We tried something different. We sat down held hands and had a cozy time talking one-on-one with each other in round robin. That should clearly be part of our ritual.
* Family Walk.
* Family Time!
* Chili
* Read+Write
* Walked with wife!
* Finished [[Family Log]]!
* Read+Write
