Owly isn't playing nice with Bob. Bye Owly, hello Dark Mode (whitelisting just works better). I prefer Owly's look a billionty percent.

Tango WAN Down! Fuck. Even the router is hairy, but it came back. Is this a power problem? It's so weird to see both hit. "Tether Me Softly" off [[m14]] at least gets [[m10]] back online.

Bob is absolutely destroying anything remoting in over the LAN or WAN. I'm talking 100% CPU usage on these browsers. Even [[m10]] is feeling the fuckin' heat at times. I don't know if this is nodejs or Bob. Singlefile doesn't have these problems. It's weird how much compute power is being thrown at this thing.
