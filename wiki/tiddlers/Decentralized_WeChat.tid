title: Decentralized WeChat

WeChat is a monster. It's disgusting. It is spreading. We already do much of it, but they have come closer to perfectly the centralization of information/power/control over populations with it. This is the way the world is going.

We desperately need a p2p service which runs in WASM and probably Golang (or Rust) which is highly extensible. We need Linus to Linux on this Messaging+ problem. Piercing through NATs is really hard fucking work though.

Monetizing it isn't easy. Open-sourcing goes a long way. You still need a foundation that shapes it.
