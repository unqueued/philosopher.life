!! About:

//Who was I? I seek to preserve those memories which will help me flourish best while honoring my own memory. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.//

<<<
I wrote them down in my diary so that I wouldn't //have// to remember them.

We're all stories, in the end...just make it a good one, eh?

I'm a moral agent; I'm an autonomous person who persists through time. Whatever it means to say it, if you took a snapshot of the particular configuration of the objects which constitute me right now in my context, you'd have captured only a thin timeslice of who I am.<<ref "1">> I hope I am greater than the sum of my timeslices, and I desperately hope to contribute to something much greater than myself. I know I am at least an ego tunnel: a prerequisite-X-factor-development-spectrum-cluster-stage homo sapien from which Dasein emerges that models for itself the experience of the Being of Becoming. I am that long ≥4-dimensional tunnel creature with consciousness, a constituent expression of evolution and our universe, that extends down the paths of the branches of the tree of possible worlds. Here I attempt to self-document what I take to be relevant about that creature.<<ref "5">>

{[[About|About, The Opening of the Rabbithole]]} is the most crucial narrative I tell myself, and even this project is completed in service to it. I hope this [[Root]]ed directory serves as a historical foundation for explaining and justifying myself to myself. This is my story.<<ref "6">> Here are the records and contexts of my lifelong practice of the [[Art of Living]], and I hope it will be my masterpiece.<<ref "7">> I hope {[[Vault]]} eventually tells the story of a life, my life, that I would joyfully elect to live again and again into eternity if given the chance.<<ref "8">> I hope this directory will be my life's magnum opus; one's life should be one's life's work; your life is your greatest project, by definition. 

Here I archive and piece together those narratives of mine which make me proud, nostalgic, or pensive for the sake of my future-self. {[[Vault]]} is a sequence of memoirs, projects, and shifts in my perspectives, values, and goals. It gives me a chance to reflect upon seasons, eras, arcs, and chapters of my life. I hope for this directory to eventually evolve into a trophy vault and a place for me to celebrate my hard work.

Eventually my work from {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]}, {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]}, and {[[Focus|Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]} will migrate into this vault.  Retiring my work allows me to set it aside, to distance myself from it, to reflect on it in a different way, and sometimes to celebrate it.

I lived for 31 years before I started writing this wiki. I've precious little writing from or about that time period. There are gaps in my narrative which I must fill.<<ref "9">> This is a place to define my past. I need to reflect on my entire narrative, to connect the dots for myself, and to find the patterns which emerge. Thinking about "//who I was//" is part of satisfying that fundamental maxim: [[Know Thyself]].

One worry I have is that this is a rationalization-facility or a refuse bin rather than a tool for building the morally justified story of who I was. In my [[fff]] modeling of my [[4DID]] to myself, I'm going to have to be reductive, and I want to make sure I do so with moral integrity. I must always doubt myself in this respect. It is easy to be conveniently wrong to my selfish ends, and I must be ever vigilante against the hedonic desires and passions which seek to heterodoxically enslave my Reason. Oh, that doesn't mean I aim to be ascetic, but I remember that when push comes to shove (and I can't have both), I have a habit of viciously pursuing the [[The Beautiful]] rather than [[The Right]] in my pursuit of [[The Good]]. Justice is incredibly expensive here because it's so tempting to tell myself the story of myself in an all too delusionally flattering and selfishly convenient confabulation. I must prevent myself from sliding into painting myself the hero of my self-authored story. I hope I have the balls to face my regrets. Indeed, I will need all the courage, honesty, and luck I can muster to avoid the being evilly integrated self-constitution trap.<<ref "e">> 

Admittedly, I spend almost no time developing this space, except for searching. Perhaps the dead shall bury the dead. It doesn't have to be a barren wasteland though. I hope to be motivated build and use a serious catalog and to wisely amortize my self-reflection. Lastly, I hope to provide myself perspective on //who I was// for the sake of both knowing //who I am// and planning //who I will be//. Thus, I hope to have a prolific and unabridged life of happiness.

!! Principles:

* Graft work from the rest of this wiki into this {[[Vault]]}
* Reconstruct accurate narratives and timelines as best you can while accepting your fallibility.
* Explore who you were and what your life was like.
* For now, divide your life into geographically-based timeline chunks.
* Figure out ways to tell yourself your story better, more efficiently, with clarity, and more coherently.

!! Dreams:

* Setup {Vault} with an automated script walking through my timeline on this wiki!
* I could use a more dynamic timeline tool. There are overlapping eras, patterns, and gaps that I can represent better with another tool.
* [[H-Book: Wiki Integration]]
* Import gmail/chat, the source, reddit, etc.

<<footnotes "1" "My claim isn't that this is physically possible, and obviously a full representation on my time-slice requires more information than we might even conceivably be able to model (I know I'm quite [[fff]]).">>

<<footnotes "5" "Good luck, [[h0p3]]!">>

<<footnotes "6" "Obviously, my narratival divisions are poorly justified subjective human constructs. Life is chaotically complex, hard to reduce, difficult to categorize and systematize, and that's all because it is difficult to draw clean lines. That's okay. It is our Daseinic plight to play games of semantics with ourselves; it is the foundation of human communication, consciousness, and our fallible analysis+synthesis. I'm bootstrapping; I'm building it brick by brick, and I'm filling it droplet by droplet. I have to start somewhere, and I shouldn't expect perfection.">>

<<footnotes "7" "These works tend to be as well-formulated and articulate as I could be in my given contexts, although the formatting is not always perfect (especially for work grafted into this wiki). I'm autistic and not naturally gifted with language. Further, my oversharing and honesty comes off as stupid, arrogant, and cringeworthy to most people. That's okay though: I probably think and feel similarly about your life too. It's time to be courageous when we look at ourselves in the mirror of time. I'm not going to be ashamed of it, and I'm not going to hate myself. That isn't useful to me. So...fuck off, haters.">>

<<footnotes "8" "Which I will admit is not up to me in many ways, qua moral luck.">>

<<footnotes "9" "I feel it necessary to point out that I am slow to work on this section; it's very difficult for me. Further, it is a constant work in progress. Rebuilding my memories in narrative form isn't easy. Consider this section to always be under construction. I'm not going to beat myself up about its lack of content, imprecision, or any other flaws. Trying to distill 31 years isn't easy, especially when your memory is fading.">>

<<footnotes "e" "I'd like to point out how sociopaths are very well integrated agents. It's essential to them being so effective in achieving their ends.">>

<<footnotes "h" "To house the //Vault://[[Root]] is quite an honor, imho. =)">>
