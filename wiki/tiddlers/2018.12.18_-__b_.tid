Sometimes I feel like I give people the far superior strategic position in the dialectic (which is fine in [[T42T]], but it sucks against those who do not aim to be Reasonable). They have the chance to leverage as much as they wish against me. They get to see the courses of action even in underhanded fighting (which is not my goal). I am cornered in here. You have me surrounded, lol. I suppose one point of encapsulating myself into this transparent hyperobject orb makes me something that is technically digestible (though there is much to digest).
