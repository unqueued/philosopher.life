*** I thought they were going to scapegoat it. He has been wildly more stable than I imagined.

*** It's a good thing I don't have to do that. I shouldn't be in that game either.

* Think About It
** https://www.theringer.com/2019/4/19/18485861/wrongthink-ben-shapiro-quillette-joe-rogan-intellectual-dark-web
*** I mean, I have a hard time picking out sane people, especially conservatives, at any point in my life, period. WSJ and The Economist seem glossed over here. Perhaps I'm delusional enough to think most people are to the Right of me.
** http://nautil.us/issue/71/flow/why-the-flow-of-time-is-an-illusion
*** I'm no compatibilist. The price here is quite high. Spinoza, ofc, doesn't give a shit. I'm not going to call consciousness an illusion if I can help it (though I have obviously wrestled with it). 
** https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/todays-biggest-threat-the-polarized-mind/
*** You're gonna have to show me what moral realism means in terms of dialectics. Your epistemology and ontology are meaningless without them. SA is a joke sometimes. =(
*** It appears that we can leverage trust in each other. F2F/P2P modeling is the only answer that works.
** https://ia.net/topics/ethics-and-ethics
*** Which is why I do not conflate nice and kind.
*** So disappointed. Codes of ethics have been largely irrelevant. You are going to have to step a layer below in design here. You will never address competitive advantage effectively enough like this.
** https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-metaphysics-of-truth/
*** God damnit. I never have enough fucking time. Obviously, I hold an inflationary perspective. 
*** I'm not in love with that definition of reflective equilibrium. No, this is a dialectic process, oscillation toward epistemic Nash equilibrium to the best of our abilities/knowledge/context, and it clearly requires a faith.
**** Ofc, that buys him the pluralism he wants. I don't even think he's fucking talking about truth; he only has method!
**** Brower, I'm sure, loves it.

*** =/ Means of production isn't mentioned. Income and wealth inequality are crucial problems, but they don't address the source (they only point).
