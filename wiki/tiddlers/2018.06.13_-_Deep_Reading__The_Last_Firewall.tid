Love the RNG, but even the lookups are huge giveaways...

The real Neo-esque powers.

If she really had these powers, I think it would be radically obvious to her well before this point in the story what kind of power it was.

Seems like face recognition is just not effectively used in this book. That's sad, since it is one of the few technologies already emerging.

I fell asleep in this book. 7/9ths into the book.

I like the idea of different intelligences among the AI.

Implant concerns were brought up in the first book. This book has more to say about it, but it's not so believable.

The antagonist (at least from a human point of view), Adam, is not believable.

Giving superpowers to a human is missing the point to me. This feels more like fantasy than Scifi.

The author works hard to make something which we can connect to as readers, but unfortunately, I think the Singularity concern is one which he just glosses over too heavily. That has been my criticism from the beginning. He thinks he is painting it, and I can pretty clearly see he is not.

I'm going to read summaries of the others before I begin them. This one wasn't worth it. The series was already one shaky ground, but now it's dead to me.
