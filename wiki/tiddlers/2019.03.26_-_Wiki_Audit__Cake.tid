title: 2019.03.26 - Wiki Audit: Cake

Chrome is better on [[monster-14]], but I just learned I experienced another loss of updates from yesterday. Thankfully, I could recover. There are no warning signs that it's not working, at all! This is absurd.

Singlefile is already radically more performant, and now I'm not convinced the loss is worth it. I can feel the difference in my browser's lag with my cursors, typing, and basic navigation. I'll spend the compute for it too, but it needs to function.

Nodejs is probably never going to be effective enough. The virtualized storyriver may be the only option. It's not the same, not by a longshot.

Fuck me. We use simultaneous multi-device all the time. I can't have my cake and eat it too. Maybe git is the out. Of course, part of me thinks moving to doom/spacemacs/nvim is the answer. Nothing is perfect. Socrates would go singlefile.

Tried going back to singlefile. I tried the old extensions, and they don't work! I didn't try Timimi, but Chromium isn't meant to be supported. It sucks that there isn't a single Chromium tool that work because the Chrome-extensions are simply vastly superior to what I can find in Firefox. 

None of the options work well. =(

This is a matter of my automated incompetence.

I am lucky to have a daughter kicking ass with me.

Tried tagging every Deep Reading log.. and they all got deleted? Oops.

The .tid files are empty. Also, the paths of the .tid files are in the wiki, as empty tiddlers. Not all these path tiddlers are deleted ones, and I can't find a specific pattern, either. It looks like the automatically-changed (aka firmcoded or touched by commander) tiddlers get deleted. Here they are (just a general list):

*Foci of several (but not all) firmcoded directories
*Every tiddler matching the filter `[regexp[\d\d\d\d.\d\d.\d\d - Deep Reading Log]]` in the history of h0p3's wiki.
**In other words, every log titletagged "Deep Reading Log", with or without the title.Title. 
*A single Link Log h0p3 was working on

That foci list seems to be a list of all Autogenned - and therefore all firmcoded - directories. It used to stop at Donors, but then the list got shorter - or, rather, duplicates started appearing.

As for the Deep Reading logs, I tagged them all using Commander, so that might have something to do with it.

I don't know about that Link Log. It's an old one he was auditing.

This part is when we tried moving away from Bob, but this made h0p3's wiki instantly unusable. AndTidWiki+Resilio worked for the phone, none of the extensions worked on m10.

Off the bat, I can think a few reasons for this problem:

*Whatever the heck was the problem before
**I don't want to go searching through the Computer Musings and Wiki Audit logs, but h0p3 says that something like this has happened before.
*Restarting Bob when it's still making changes
**We did this a couple times, and each time it seemed to get worse. Might just be me.
**Actually makes the Link Log make sense.
*Making big changes all at once
**Commander, firmcoding, and importing all seemed to do this. Maybe it's just editing multiple tiddlers at a time, then saving them all at a time, that breaks it.
***Might also be why it gets to such a slow crawl we have to restart Bob!

Importing the missing stuff, deleting the path tiddlers, and hoping this never happens again!..

Well, as soon as I pressed the button for firmcoding, the following happened (and seems to happen every time):

*node goes haywire
**Took up all the CPU looping over the .tid files
*I restart it
*The path tiddlers show up again, foci empty

If I press the button again, it's just fine, though. It goes crazy when those tiddlers aren't there, but when they are it works as expected.
