!! Audit:

* This was a good month for most of us. I think my wife felt a lot of pressure on her.
* My daughter likes to sign her writing at the bottom. =) - That's something I'd normally put at the top, I think. I'm grateful that she engages in the practice. I think it matters to her, which is excellent.
** I may continue to have her do it. It allows me to cook.
* I'm very pleased with the modification to compliment ourselves. I think I'd like to have us compliment ourselves before others get the chance. 
* I truly care about these creatures lives. They are ends in themselves to me. I love them so much. It shines so brightly on the page to me. I feel so lucky to have them (which, ofc, doesn't mean I don't have a right to complain about the state of affairs).
* Real family is hard to find.
