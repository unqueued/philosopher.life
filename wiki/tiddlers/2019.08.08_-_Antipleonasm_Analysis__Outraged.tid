title: 2019.08.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Outraged

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.

The sentiment is correct. Outrage is only a starting place, but that may be implied. Causation is a problem if we take this too literally because "unaffected" is nearly impossible to achieve. Further, it is not guaranteed that a semblance of justice will be served even if we all cooperate at this point, but I think our odds (in such a case) are fairly high still (despite the fact I don't predict such cooperation). Also, justice for whom? Historical injustice can't be fixed in most cases, and we can't calculate it all the way down (which is hardly a reason to think we shouldn't try). The original phrasing is rhetorically elegant, but a more accurate sentence is:

"Significant justice for the living and unborn is unlikely to be served unless capitalists and reactionaries fully empathize with the global poor and future generations."

I'm not so convinced the global poor's self-empathy has much influence beyond forming class consciousness and radical shifts in the memeplexes on the planet necessary to convince those with more direct forms of [[power]] to decentralize it. That does not fill me with much [[hope]], but I know it is possible. [[ridtyawtr]].
