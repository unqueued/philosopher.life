 so, this thing occasionally pops up on my computer. at first i thought it must be okay cause where is it coming from if not the devvice itself? but I did a quick online search and it says generally not to mess with BIOS at all, could be bad news

 I generally update my BIOS. Unfortunately, Lenovo is widely known to install spyware. I have a purchased a couple Lenovo laptops, but I always reinstall the OS.

 You could look up your current BIOS and computer and see if it really needs the update, but most of the time you can live without it just fine.
