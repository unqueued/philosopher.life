title: 2018.09.14 - Computer Musings: Spectrum

Spectrum is directly fucking us today.<<ref "s">> 4G tether time!

Aside: back before there were smartphones, I'd carry two things on my keychain: a multi-boot linux USB swiss army knife and a wireless adapter. Many times I could not trust the computer in front of me nor the network it was connected to, but I could boot up into my own environment and connect to random wireless access points.

I'm lucky to still have a few adapters in our tech drawers.

Annnnnndd.....we're back.

<<footnotes "s" "I literally believe the Boards of Directors of the major ISPs do not deserve to live. It's the equivalent of burning down the Library of Alexandria or preventing others from becoming literate because you can't profit enough from it. This is power centralization. They do aim to enslave you to every [[dok]] they legally can (and beyond).">>
