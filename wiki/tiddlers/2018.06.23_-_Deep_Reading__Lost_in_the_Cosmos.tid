title: 2018.06.23 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos

The book just got super interesting. Percy decides to take a 40 page detour into semiotics and perhaps his actual theory. He has my attention! This is exactly what I'm interested in. That is he deeply concerned with how we speak and sign to ourselves, that we are that kind of creature, means he may have something useful to say to me. That is definitely in the right ballpark!
