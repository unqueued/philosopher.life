!! What is your favorite song and why?

Always with the simple questions for which I never seem capable of offering a simple answer.

What makes a song my favorite? I hate to say it, but I'm not a monolithic identity in some respects. What makes a song my favorite is particularized to a context. Some days, it is Johnny Cash's rendition of Reznor's "Hurt." Other days, Rachmaninoff's Barcarolle dazzles and humbles me. In my grind mode, Caribou's Sun (Altrice's 'Only What You Gave Me' Remix) mesmerizes me. When I'm meditating, Paul Ellis' "Firefly Rising Outshined by the Moon" transports me. Bach's Prelude from Suite No.1 in G major for Cello moves me to tears every single time. I feel uncomfortable naming one song. 

Music is most powerful in the moment. What makes me soar, wail, pumped, energized,  cathartic, or emotional? That's the stuff that music is made of and for. Music must activate me. I listen to music all day. Only sometimes, when I'm really lucky, do I recapture its true-true magic. To my dismay, it is rarer as I age. I love it, but one builds up a resistance or tolerance to the soul piercingness of music.

Of course, I'm addicted to it. My favorite, I suppose, is that which grants me maximum pleasure or utility in the context.

I have a weird history with music.

Admittedly, I have a problem, a deficiency in my brain: I can't remember song lyrics. Most people who have heard a song 5 or 500 times can recall the lyrics, easily and almost mindlessly singing along with the song. But, I usually can't. This strong innate ability which even children and Alzheimer's patients have, I don't have. There is a flaw in my brain that has twisted how I see, understand, and interact with the world, and it is tied to my inability to remember song lyrics in an efficient or effective manner. 

For example, I'm a PK, I've sung Amazing Grace a thousand times. I've played it for serious performances. I've played it on a dozen instruments. I've studied the words and the history of the song. But, I'd be lucky to even sing, recall, or write down for you the first verse. The melody resonates deeply with me, but it does not activate human words in me. It activates something else. What? I do not know.

For me, music is about the notes. Vocals are just sounds, texture, and notes which form something to listen to in itself.<<ref "1">> I wish I could put my finger on it for you. I do not know.

Music is a drug. Sometimes it is the only thing which can soothe me or motivate me. What drug do I need at the moment? That is my favorite. I'm capricious and lust-filled when it comes to music. Give it to me! I crave it!!
