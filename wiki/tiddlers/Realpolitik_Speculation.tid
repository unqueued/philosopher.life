title: Realpolitik Speculation

//This [[Relic]] might be the original [[Leet]] directory. So many mechanics, rhetorical devices, structures, and approaches to the wiki came out of this project. Regardless of its contents, it helped me understand the kinds of objects I aimed to construct in this wiki.//

!! About:

//Where I hope to channel Michel de Nostredame (et al.), Niccolò Machiavelli, Karl Marx, Leo Strauss, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, George Orwell, Flannery O'Connor, and Mike Judge, the political theorists we need but don't deserve.<<ref "1">>

Good! Use your aggressive feelings, boy. Let the hate flow through you!

Here I tell you how I //really// feel about Humanity. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say. I don't hold back any punches either.

Rules of [[Realpolitik Speculation]]:

# Don't talk about [[Realpolitik Speculation]].
# ....Don't talk about [[Realpolitik Speculation]].<<ref "2">>
# Empathize with humanity, but stop attempting to empathize with every individual human.

[[Realpolitik Speculation]] does not require me to empathize with my enemies.  It's not practical. Here I tell my enemies how much I hate them. To my enemies:

//I'm opposed to your invalid identity. If you were rational enough, you would hate yourselves too.//<<ref "3">> Here I watch the world burn as I laugh and wail. I seek answers, and you clearly don't have them. Your conveniently willed ignorance is only surpassed by your blatant hypocrisy.<<ref "4">> For that and for you, dearest ones, I clown-scream to you a love-poem: [[Poem: Realpolitik Speculation]].

/ahem && /adjust(monacle)

Alright, now that we're past the preliminary fuck-you's, I'm going to answer one of the greatest questions in The Great Conversation of Humanity: //Who are we?// Allow me to hospitably offer you The Word, the Fundamental Redpill:

__//Humans are irredeemably selfish, egoistic creatures; yes, even you and me//__.<<ref "5">>

I didn't stutter, so breathe it in. I'm doing you a favor (yes, you're welcome). Don't simply stick it in your pocket! Instead, employ the virtue necessary to mull it around. Digest it. Walk it down the decision trees and branches. Take it to the Nth degree. Does the world appear more coherent? Can you accept it? Do you have the intellectual integrity to keep it down, or will you purge yourself of the redpill you just swallowed? The truth can be very violent; it wreaks havoc on our reality maps. I empathize with the pain of taking the redpills of hard realism. You are being baptized by fire. Fundamental truths are often painfully acquired. 

The cost of consuming the redpill is the loss of innocence. So, I must apologize up front about that fact and for my subsequent behavior: I'm going to demonstrate this elementary fact of human nature to you over and over again. We are reducible to piles of physical atoms from which complex genetic and memetic structures emerge and evolve in the world. No one can give a reason for why these emergences are valuable but ourselves, and that means that life is, objectively-speaking, meaningless. I warn you: you can run, but you can't hide from the truth. You're evil because I think you're evil, QED.

Every great existential philosopher claims to have destroyed metaphysics and the objectivity of the transcendental. Here is mine. And, what is leftover isn't pretty. The world becomes coherently self-consistent, predictable, and lucidly intelligible when you accept who we really are: we're selfish creatures, every last one of us.<<ref "6">>

Like many who have wielded the Sword of Truth before me, I am going to slay an entire ecosystem of memetic networks that have been passed down through the generations or injected into the masses through myths, legends, lies, rhetoric, and ultimately virtue-theoretically viciously trained Fastminds (even if only for myself, in my own mind). My frontal lobes are going to decode the dominant idealogies of our day and age for you. I act as your Statesman on your behalf in this domain. 

I'm here to swallow my weekly Redpill, drink deeply of the Water of Life, and gorge myself on the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge.<<ref "7">> I hope to have the integrity to peer behind the veil of reality and shrewdly interpret the ugly ponerological facts and implications of social, political, technological, and economic semiotics. I study the concept of the good of human evil. In time, I hope to demonstrate prescience and wisdom.

I say nothing either new or sane-sounding here (take your pick), but that doesn't make it wrong. If you are honest with yourself, sometimes you're not going to understand what I said (and you should honestly take the time to think very carefully about that). Sometimes you are going to realize that I "nailed it" (and probably feel a bit hopeless). Other times you may shake-your-head in profound disbelief, find yourself deeply angry with me, or perhaps even feel shocked in disgust. 

Here is my advice: if you think I nailed it in any of these articles, then take the time to consider the possibility that I've "nailed it" in those you disagree with. Be absurdly charitable. Consider the possibility that you have been systematically wrong about everything, and that I have clearer vision through the fog than you. Pretend I am God in your interpretation.<<ref "8">> I hope that's not asking too much. 

Do you hate me yet? Well. I'm sorry. I can only ask you to think about it again. I'll keep frantically pointing you to it. I hope you will eventually see it too. Let us ponder those immortal words:

<<<
Chaos isn’t a pit. //Chaos is a ladder//. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.

–Petyr "Little Finger" Baelish, Game of Thrones 
<<<

It's time to pay attention. Here I chronicle and prophesy about systemic chaos and evil in the Human species. Whether or not you take this to be a political work in itself is up to you.<<ref "9">> As always, //caveat emptor//. This is the interwebs: buckle-up and ready your eyebleach. So, here, take your medicine.

<<footnotes "3" "Please understand this as a literary device. It's a powerful tool for venting and doing the work of this wiki. Remember, I'm talking to myself on this wiki. I hope to be wise here. I hope to find the answers. I must accept what I believe. It is the only way I can be happy. To those whom I might offend, I will say this once: I love the RL people that read this. If you are literally reading h0p3's wiki; you aren't my enemy. You care about what I think. I owe you the same. You're letting me unload and decompress. You are kind. I can't thank you enough. Seriously, I love you.">>

<<footnotes "5" "Yup, even that exception you are trying to come up with. Oh, Altrusim and Cooperation? Yeah. No matter how much you try to argue against it, the roots of their existence, the core of why it is that we engage in those benevolent practices, the fundamental nature of these objects, is selfishness on a post-modernist background. Oh, I grant that the expressions of selfishness are deeply complex in our world (and positively deceptive in so many ways), but this is not an ad hoc argument (far from it; it is incredibly predictive). Selfishness is the cause and ultimate explanation for our behavior and beliefs (for how we compute). Empathy, love, altruism, and cooperation are merely the means to the ends of Human Selfishness. It's written into us by nature itself. Survival of Fittest is a core principle of nature, it cannot be doubted. But, your moral delusions surely can. Make what you wish of nihilism. Find meaning for yourself. Be wise in your selection of ethical and metaethical thought.">>

<<footnotes "8" "I'm trying to help you. I'm obviously not God or a god, or whatever. I'm just a human, and we both know that. You should still strive to be maximally charitable in your interpretation of my words though.">>

<<footnotes "9" "What isn't realpolitikal? I wouldn't trust me either. Who can you trust, and why? I'm an idealogue. No matter where you stand, you can accuse me of generating the Black propaganda of covert psychological operations, supporting the anti-Christ, or some other absurd accusation. There is no winning. You are in a trusting trust position, if not one of needing to exercise serious charity.">>

<<footnotes "10" "Talk about an //Original Gangster//, this page helped me understand what I was even doing on this wiki. Many of the mechanics came from this page. My style is evident here. My need to get it out obvious. I am so grateful for the opportunity I afforded myself in beginning this project. It waned, but now I see I cannot give up on it. You will, of course, note, that it coincides to some extent with longer-term patterns in my cannabliss use. However, I have been remarkably accurate, I must say. Paranoia has its merits.">>
