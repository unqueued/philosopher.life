title: 2019.01.13 - Wiki Audit: Brief

I briefly tried to change the GettingStarted to include today's (and yesterday's) [[New]] tiddlers. I think this might be a mistake. Meh. I really do need [[others]] to find their own doorways here. I need to tell myself the story of myself, and they need to figure out how to tell themselves that story. I literally can't do that effectively enough for them by definition. I think I can make it easier, and in a way, if they are really going to understand what I'm doing, they need to see it through my lens.
