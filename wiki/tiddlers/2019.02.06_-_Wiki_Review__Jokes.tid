title: 2019.02.06 - Wiki Review: Jokes

* [[KKK]]
** If I joke about something offline more than once, it should be in the wiki.
* [[2019.02.05 - Kevin Kortum: Drunken Intro]]
** I had fun writing it. It's still plenty personal and personable, albeit it isn't as rigorous as some others.
*** He's seen me before though.
* [[KevinKniveK]]
** Fascinating to see another [[Public Self-Modeler]].
* [[2019.02.05 - Music Exploration: Humdrumming]]
** My favorite comments. I should explore music while drunk more often.
* [[2019.02.05 - Afterschool Teaching: Flu]]
** I'm trying to keep clean. I really don't want more people getting sick.
*** I wonder if the coldsnap was part of this.
* [[2019.02.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Support Our Troops]]
** One of my favorite parts of this log is my ability to pick out the [[salience]] given my context of that day. If I don't feel like dealing with [[Ayn Rand]] that moment, I don't have to. That doesn't mean I don't have to eventually respond (surely I am obligated), but I like having the choice. That space is valuable to me.
* [[2019.02.05 - Prompted Introspection: I'm in.]]
** Cosmopolitanism is pretty simple in some respects. I'm not sure I should say more.
* [[2019.02.05 - Wiki Review: Underwhelming, But Okay]]
** To the two other humans on the planet who will ever read this sentence: I love you both. =)
*** Since you both enjoy //pun//ishing me, I should return the favor (it's [[T42T]]esque!):
**** When does a joke become a dad joke?<<ref "a">>
**** What's the difference between a well-dressed man on a bicycle and a poorly dressed man on a tricycle?<<ref "b">>
* [[2019.02.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Amazing]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.02.05 - TDL: Grind]]
** Edited.
** I'm liking this {[[dream]]}ish style more. A splash of discipline wouldn't hurt. I hope to grow the recipe.
* [[Real-Time Embedded Wiki Signature]]
** We'll get there.
