* Talked to my son, who obviously was just waking up.

** It might be even better the second time through. I'm am loving it. One thing I adore about it is how those who are having the shizoid redpilled experience are the ones we empathize with. They are right to disagree with the world presented to them. I feel a real kinship with them.
