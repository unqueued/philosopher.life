title: 2019.02.24 - TLDR: A Car Ride

//[[KevinKniveK]], you are right. I definitely shouldn't attempt to [[TLDR]] high precision content I hold so dear in blind pursuit of overly reductive concision. I think it is a disservice to some of my tiddlers. I need to generate meaning [[irwartfrr]]. Thank you for making me think. Something is fundamentally wrong about not thinking holistically. Even in the pursuit of henosis, I think there is something [[antipleonasmic]]ally valuable to explore here. It still may not be worthy. I appreciate your advice! I cannot tell you what I'm so supposed to write or why sometimes because I just don't understand or see it myself.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Your rabbithole is one big circle.//

[[h0p3]]: //Oof. You have kicked me in the nuts. That is a burn beyond your understanding.//

[[j3d1h]]: //At some point, you accept the illogical rather than going insane trying to make it logical.//

[[h0p3]]: //I think fighting the paranoia is part of my moral obligation as a man of [[hope]]. I can't bring myself to accept the skeptic's ridiculously high epistemic standard of certainty. To pursue that blinding light, I would deconstruct myself so thoroughly it would dissolve my capacity to perceive any world.<<ref "t">>//

[[j3d1h]]: //pussy.//<<ref "l">>

[[h0p3]]: //Doing your best requires learning how to be resilient to destabilizing uncertainty. Control the meaningless random chaos as best you can. Even meaningful mutability of meaning in our memory requires modal contingency obtains. Make mistakes [[irwartfrr]] as you gamble each timeslice of your [[4DID]].//

...

[[j3d1h]]: //Ha, this is like a miniature version of what we said. You cut it down to the core argument: mostly sick burns and high compliments.//
