title: Drafting Strategy

Here is the drafting structure:

* Ban Phase 1: A, B, A, B, A, B
* Pick Phase 1: A, B, B, A, A, B
* Ban Phase 2: B, A, B, A
* Pick Phase 2: B, A, A, B

I hope to create a set of generalized principles for drafting in pro play.

# You must have at least 2 AD and 2 AP sources of damage.
## Preferably 1 carry of each
## Supports and tanks sometimes should not be counted as sources of damage.
## If you don't, then MR and Armor become too effective against your team
## The exception is an extremely strong hypercarry; then, and only then, should you ever consider a X/1 or 1/X split of AD/AP.
