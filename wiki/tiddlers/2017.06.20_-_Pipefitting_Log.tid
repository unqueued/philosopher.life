title: 2017.06.20 - Pipefitting Log

Today was interesting. Luke didn't really finish even drawing the simulator yesterday. I immediately started doing the measurements and checking for him. He got several things wrong. After they were fixed, he got copies of them. We drew out our spools. I did the math, and I had them check it. While they were checking, I looked around in the pipe yard for parts for another project.

I came back. They said they did the math, but I wasn't sure. I did the math again to double check. It was fine. They went to cut the pipe, and I worked on making a tool for myself. I made a flange wrench for myself. I just looked it up, and they go for $85. Mine turned out nicely. I used a solid steel bar and bolts. I had to do significant grinding to make them fit. I'm glad I made it! I've also got my solid steel bricks (1-inch thick!) marked and ready for cutting into alignment dogs. I think they are going to be pretty awesome. I'm considering making 8 instead of 4.

They still hadn't cut the pipe fully. I went straight to grinding the pipes. I did them all. I hit the valves we were given too. It's clear that I didn't remember much about valves. I need to re-read through these books again. It would be worth my time.

After lunch, we started fitting. While the setup was far longer than it should have taken, the actual fitting went very quickly. Chris and I banged it out. We have very little left to do tomorrow. One 90, a pipe, and some flanges. That's it. 

I think it is possible we will be asked to do socket weld or possibly screwpipe for the 1" simulator. We'll see. I think our teacher wants a pretty picture to "show off" to people looking at his program.
