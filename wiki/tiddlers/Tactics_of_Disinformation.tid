title: Tactics of Disinformation

; Silence
: If you are going to lose, don't engage. Accrue undue benefit of the doubt by hearing no evil, seeing no evil, and speaking no evil. Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it. If it's not reported, it didn't happen. Remain silent, vanish evidence, hide yourself, or play dumb, and when forced to speak: describe all charges, regardless of public evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations which can have no basis in fact.

; Red Herring
: Change the subject. Sidetrack the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments to turn attention to a new, more manageable topic, or create bigger distractions. Incredulously avoid discussing key issues. Indignantly focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. What about x?

; Strawman
: Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.

; Ad hominem
: Sidetrack opponents and discourage would-be supporters with ridiculous labels and unpopular titles such as: kook, terrorist, conspiracy theorist, radical, militia, racist, fanatic, deviant, nutcase, ranter, crackpot, rumor monger, troll, etc. Question motives without evidence. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or bias.

; Troll 
: Hit and run with a steady stream of new identities which attack or troll without explaining criticism; simply make an accusation without discussion that dignifies the opponent's point of view. Waste their time and energy. Goad, chide, antagonize, and taunt your opponents to draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, then rebuff them for being too sensitive to criticism.

; Flooding
: Brigade and spam more information than can be processed. Make sure the truth is lost in a sea of irrelevance.

; Appeal to Authority
: Falsely appeal to authority and manufacture claims to truth. Create your own expert, group, author, leader, etc. or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so with a veneer of authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority, present your argument with enough jargon and minutia to illustrate some plausibility of your authority, and deny your opponent's claim without further discussion, demonstration, or citation.

; Appeal to Unoriginality
: Dismiss opponent's charges as old news, a mere rehash, unoriginal, and already handled in previous encounters.

; Fall-back Positions.
: Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the high road and confess with apparent candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made. Accuse opponents of mercilessly seizing on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities. Garner sympathy+respect and get praised for coming clean and owning up to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues.

; Dissolve Responsibility
: Distribute responsibility until it fades out. Draw upon the overall umbrella of events, point to the complexity of the circumstances, and paint the entire affair as too big to solve or delineate individual culpability.

; Double Standard
: Ignore evidence or solutions presented, and demand complete or impossible proofs and solutions from your opponents while baselessly denying alternative possibilities to your own point of view. Avoid the issues by hypocritically holding your opponents to a higher standard; smuggle in the fundamental misattribution error.

; Falsify Evidence
: Introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opposing presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications.

; Silence Critics
: Removing an opponent from the conversation eliminates the need to argue against them.
