My poetry muscle is about as a small and weak as my penis. Let's do it. This OCD, bi-polar feller' is goin' learn me suhmm. I don't mind slam poetry; I can take it more literally than other kinds (praise the jeebus).

Namesake-1 poem opens with quotes like my tiddlers. He surrounds it with antipleonasms. Preach to me, sir. Give me all the doorways to heaven. OMG. Fucking HARSH! I'm already in tears.

Airport codes. It's all over the place. I have no idea. I see at least 3 stories jumping out, and I can't really tie them together. Derp.

```
When you're dumb enough for long enough, you're gonna meet someone too smart to love you, and they're gonna love you 

anyway, and it's gonna go so poorly.
```

That's a hell of a two-liner right thar. I'm not even sure how to weigh my emotions on it. It pushes me hard. 

```
I am a pile of bricks and you are holding a sledgehammer,
which is to say I would not exist without you.
```

Did I just meet myself in a poem?

I've used this exact phrase for a long time: 

* [[2007.05.23 - Vacation....err....V-O-cation as a calling]]
* [[2017.11.08 - Apology Log]]
* [[2018.11.21 - Sphygmus: Thanksgiving]]

Dialectics in this piece all over the place. Ballad is the correct word. I have no idea what the author is talking about, but then I suggest he scaffolds from some particularly painful image into this absurdly generalizable one that kicks me straight in the nuts.

My brother needs to read //Joey//. He talks about this often with me. 

Holy fuck. It's too much. He can't read this. I can barely read it. It's shredding me inside and out. It's a short story in two-pages, brawling the everliving fuck out of its reader.

The expression "I'm so lucky I'm so--lucky" is a truism and a non-trivial one to me. I have to debate with folks what counts as "luck" often enough.

---

Namesake-2 (maybe chapters? I love how there is a structure, a rhyme, a reason). Again, he opens with quote antipleonasms to set the stage, build bridges into it, etc.

We both have strong opinions on what counts as home and family. His work is highly autobiographical, and I think it's neat how compact/compressed it is.

Today is a snow day, but I am not understanding his Snow Theory.

My little shits. That is often what I call them. I cannot say we agree on the nature of [[The Beautiful]]. This is a common problem I face.
