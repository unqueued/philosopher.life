title: Poem: Of Desire Satisfaction

```
I'm ready for the day where I feel comfortable in my own skin, 
where I'm secure with who I am and the world around me,
and with believing I belong.
Let's be happy.

I fear the world and I would have to change too much for that to ever happen. 
We can only be comfortable skindeep. 
Our core primal desires will never be satisfied.
This is why I weep.
```
