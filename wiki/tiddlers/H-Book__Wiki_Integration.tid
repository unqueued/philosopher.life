title: H-Book: Wiki Integration

The [[H-Book]] should probably be integrated into this wiki. Unfortunately, I have a problem. It's locked inside a .docx file. It's way too fucking large, and more problematically, I can't CnP it. There are serious coloration-based and font work that needs to be captured to appreciate what it is: that is the basis of how I talked to my future self. Conversions to HTML are really, really fucking ugly. I still may need to hack it together that way.
