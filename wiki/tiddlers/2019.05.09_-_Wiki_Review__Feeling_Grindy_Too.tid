title: 2019.05.09 - Wiki Review: Feeling Grindy Too

* [[2019.05.08 - Link Log: Render Unto]]
** Nearly commentless.
** I'm going to write more comments about the fucking tiddler than I did in the tiddler itself. 
** I'm not going to hold myself to too absurd a standard (right? :P), but I will laugh about the work anyway.
** Sometimes it's a dump, and sometimes it's a place to wrestle some. It's already such an impossible task.
* [[2019.05.08 - Afterschool Teaching: Chilled]]
** I'm surprised that it will be ending so soon. The 21st is coming up.
* [[2019.05.08 - Wiki Review: Wear It Out]]
** Yeah, this does feel more grindy as usual. I'm going with the flow for now.
* [[2019.05.08 - Prompted Introspection: Money Pouch]]
** Edited.
** I can feel my memory slipping yet again.
* [[2019.05.08 - TDL: Workout]]
** Wait, where are the ribs again?
** Wiring task first, then spackle.
* [[2019.05.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Booty]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.05.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Our Responsibilities]]
** Edited.
** I'm adding practically nothing, as usual.
* [[Fitness Routine]]
** Edited.
** Seems like a solid starting place for us. I hope this becomes a practical habit ingrained way down deep in my children. This is not an easy beast to defeat in our family.
