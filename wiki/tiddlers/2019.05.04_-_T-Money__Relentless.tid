He's gone.
SAT 12:04 AM
Lol
SAT 12:04 AM
?
SAT 12:05 AM
I figured you'd be passed out.
SAT 12:05 AM
I judged wrong.
SAT 12:05 AM
Hah
SAT 12:05 AM
Naw, I'm fired up.
SAT 12:12 AM
Working on the devil to you.
SAT 12:13 AM
Devil to me?
SAT 12:14 AM
Tax optimization for decentralizing power
SAT 12:14 AM
I'm in favor of decentralizing power. Giving more power to each individual state.
SAT 12:15 AM
Ah, well, I mean decentralized down to individuals.
SAT 12:15 AM
Though, I think that includes federation.
SAT 12:15 AM
But individuals voted trump in office. Do we trust them?
SAT 12:16 AM
Lmao
SAT 12:16 AM
It's true. They did. I think capitalism is the cause of that too.
SAT 12:17 AM
I'm not baiting for an argument. Just poking fun. Don't let me distract you from legit work.
SAT 12:17 AM
I don't disagree. Media's quest for ratings put him there.
SAT 12:17 AM
Ratings=$
SAT 12:18 AM
That's part of the equation, no doubt.
SAT 12:18 AM
And the fact no one understands a fucking thing. Even I'm a dumbass but I know more than most! For fucks sake. Lol
SAT 12:19 AM
I'm on board with you in many ways. But it is like Turing my back on God to abandon what I dedicated 4 years of intense study to.
SAT 12:20 AM
If that makes sense.
SAT 12:20 AM
lol!
SAT 12:20 AM
I hear that.
SAT 12:21 AM
Like killing off a part of ourselves, our darlings to change sometimes.
SAT 12:21 AM
Examined faith is anxiety inducing no matter how you cut it.
SAT 12:22 AM
Can I talk to you about Jesus and my attempts at Christianity without the wrath of your unrelenting judgment?
SAT 12:23 AM
Lol!
SAT 12:24 AM
I'm glad you laugh?
SAT 12:24 AM
I think it would be better to confess before you instead. That way you don't feel judged; you can just hear me judging myself.
SAT 12:25 AM
I have been wrestling with God for long enough. I have seen to much, I hurt to much. I need the structured repentance and forgiveness. Selfishly. I need to lead my family. Instead of watching them run off to serve and be involved while I sit at home and wallow in my own inescapable morality.
SAT 12:28 AM
I don't expect you to understand. But just maybe you do. On a simpleton level.
SAT 12:29 AM
Just trying to be a simple man.
SAT 12:29 AM
I can appreciate the desire to be a simple man, and I think a lot rides on what counts as structured repentance.
SAT 12:32 AM
You've been reading [[Afterschool Program]]. I speak extremely highly of, with utmost respect for The Janitor.
SAT 12:32 AM
He is my favorite adult there by miles and miles.
SAT 12:32 AM
It is my honor to speak with the man.
SAT 12:33 AM
He is a simple man.
SAT 12:33 AM
That man shames me. As does 5CM, a little boy. I look at what they do with what they have and compare myself regarding what I've done with what I have, and I'm straight up ashamed of myself. They are among the kindest and least selfish males there.
SAT 12:36 AM
My paternal grandfather is that man to me.
SAT 12:37 AM
He must be a man of great honor, indeed.
SAT 12:37 AM
I cannot speak more highly than any other person I have met in my life.
SAT 12:39 AM
He is a simple man. And I wish I could be a fraction of the man he is and was.
SAT 12:40 AM
Blah.
SAT 12:40 AM
I just didn't want you shocked when you hear about me returning to church. Or participating in a Bible study.
SAT 12:41 AM
I am weak. 7 weeks of reflection have made that more than evident. Even if it to lead my family by example. I want to lead from the front.
SAT 12:42 AM
I don't expect you to understand. I just ask that you refrain from aggressive baiting tactics are questioning my motives in my relationship with christ.
SAT 12:44 AM
I'm not baiting you.
SAT 12:44 AM
I just hold people who claim to be Christians to the standard of Christ (which is a tall order).
SAT 12:44 AM
I know.
SAT 12:44 AM
I know. I'm asking that you know that I know That I don't meet that standard. I never will.
SAT 12:45 AM
If it helps: my wife is a Christian. My children and wife still attend. I think about 1-3% of Christians actually live up to the standard.
SAT 12:46 AM
It's important to see that none of us can be ideally perfect, but every single one of us can be practically perfect as particularized to our context.
SAT 12:46 AM
MLK Jr. will be a better man than the perfect version of me.
SAT 12:46 AM
Perfection for us includes our fallibility.
SAT 12:47 AM
I see a great deal of possibility in who we are, a freedom that most do not. But, I do believe in non-malicious ignorance. I believe in akrasia that we aren't responsible for.
SAT 12:48 AM
I also see that each day sets a different standard for us. We can't control the past.
SAT 12:48 AM
I do not ask the impossible; I study the concept of possibility quite a bit. It's part of why I know I fall short of standard appropriate to my context so clearly.
SAT 12:49 AM
I admire you in many ways. But I don't want this simple difference to drive a wedge between what little friendship we have built.
SAT 12:50 AM
The fact I'm discussing it with you shows my concern for the harm my efforts might create on our conversations.
SAT 12:50 AM
Does that make sense?
SAT 12:51 AM
I don't seek perfection. In anything. I'm just happy if I make it to work on time.
SAT 12:52 AM
I'm happy when I don't lose my patience
SAT 12:52 AM
I am bound by my own pathetic mental illnesses and in these moments I am doing my best to rise above it. Grasping to any and all things that show me a way.
SAT 12:54 AM
Haphazardly and half assed.
SAT 12:54 AM
Mind you
SAT 12:54 AM
I think we are on different pages.
SAT 12:56 AM
Maybe
SAT 12:56 AM
I think your claim is ambiguous. There is at least one interpretation in line with the very technical thing I just said above, and there is at least one interpretation which is not.
SAT 12:58 AM
You and I are going to rumble on The Golden Rule. You should never deny it with me.
SAT 12:58 AM
That said, I totally understand that neither of us live up to it ideally or practically.
SAT 12:59 AM
Yeah. I'm just gonna be going back to church and making amends with my creator.
SAT 1:05 AM
I never claimed to be no Christian. I exclaimed I had doubt and was fallen far from faith.
SAT 1:05 AM
We talk about alot of things. I don't want that to change.
SAT 1:07 AM
I own my faults. I have always felt I have. And I may make excuses. But I own every part of me.
SAT 1:09 AM
I think making amends with your creator is not going to be inconsistent with us talking about a lot of things. I believe such an event would improve our relationship.
SAT 1:10 AM
Hell I just stopped going to church about 8 or 9 months ago
SAT 1:12 AM
I had a fervant Christian write me recently. I don't know if you saw.
SAT 1:13 AM

SAT 1:13 AM
I read it.
SAT 1:13 AM
I dot remember everything. But I did read it.
SAT 1:15 AM
Wanna hear some crazy fucked up shit to break this akward convo?
SAT 1:17 AM
Lol. =) Not too awkward for me. I live in this space.
SAT 1:17 AM
Go for it.
SAT 1:17 AM
I feel like I'm asking my mentor is it OK if I pray to Jesus.
SAT 1:18 AM
Without being yelled at.
SAT 1:18 AM
Lol.
SAT 1:18 AM
Akward over here.
SAT 1:18 AM
Pray all you want. Read his words. Build your life with them. Jesus is a saint to me. Unblemished. He stands with Socrates, imho.
SAT 1:18 AM
I wish every person who claimed to be Christian was actually a Christian. The world would be a radically different place.
SAT 1:19 AM
Agreed.
SAT 1:19 AM
I respect my wife more than I know how to explain to you. Even my {[[axiom]]}s exist to be compatible with her.
SAT 1:19 AM
But if people were just honest. Not even Christian.... Can you imagine?
SAT 1:20 AM
That, in fact, is what Kant tells us to do when compute The Categorical Imperative (a fancy notion of The Golden Rule). We are literally required to think about what it means for each person to act on that maxim of being honest.
SAT 1:21 AM
It turns out to be a very Rational thing.
SAT 1:21 AM
Honesty and loyalty I hold in higher regard than most virtues.
SAT 1:21 AM
Me too! =)
SAT 1:21 AM
Back to crazy drama real life shit
SAT 1:22 AM

[[Encrypted: T-Money]]

SAT 1:43 AM
He has the means. I suspect he will keep good on his intent. And I hope that he does.
SAT 1:43 AM
He was upset. That he failed to protect another. Even considering he considers his job part of protecting his kids.
SAT 1:44 AM
But he is in constant danger on the daily if getting shot or beat up or what not from his kids.
SAT 1:45 AM
I'm sure it must be insanely hard on him.
SAT 1:45 AM
He doesn't believe in Jesus.. Makes alot of sense.
SAT 1:45 AM
Like I told. Him. I wish I had words....
SAT 1:46 AM
So much evil.
SAT 1:46 AM
On a lighter note. I made plans to visit kilcoyn. Then canceled
SAT 1:47 AM
That weekend one of our dogs passed. Just kinda bad timing.
SAT 1:48 AM
Aye. Makes sense.
SAT 1:48 AM
We got in an argument on if wife's were fair game in workplace shit talking.
SAT 1:49 AM
I told him. No. Nowhere I ever worked.
SAT 1:49 AM
Except when you talk shit about your own wife. I've heard a ton of men complain.
SAT 1:49 AM
He claimed otherwise. And that they talked shit about each other's wives or gfs.
SAT 1:49 AM
Yeah. Truth. That's different.
SAT 1:49 AM
Dude was raised and lives in a fuxking bubble. I sware.
SAT 1:50 AM
I've been in kid fights over yo momma jokes.
SAT 1:50 AM
Lol. Wives are off limits unless we close friends. Then you still better have good taste.
SAT 1:51 AM
Sounds like an insane like to cross, roflmao.
SAT 1:51 AM
line*
SAT 1:51 AM
If I have something negative to say, it is a carefully worded explanation of how someone is not being rational. I generally avoid that too.
SAT 1:52 AM
I work with 80% of conversation is insults. Most prior military. The vulgar of the vulgar. Nothing is off limits about that indivisual
SAT 1:52 AM
My wife on the other hand, she's coocoo bananas (she is going to read this sentence :P...hi, love).
SAT 1:52 AM
But we don't talk about each other's spouses.
SAT 1:53 AM
Makes sense to me.
SAT 1:53 AM
I think he worked on a few roofing crews and a few restaurants and people took advantage of his ignorance. Haha.
SAT 1:54 AM
Fuck now Matthew is gonna read this too.
SAT 1:54 AM
Why you gotta post it on your wiki?
SAT 1:54 AM
I am, like, the worst.
SAT 1:55 AM
Your friend's name is REDACTED.
SAT 1:55 AM
The lines won't be showing up at all.
SAT 1:55 AM
Hold up. I have to go. Something happened that is unexpected.
SAT 1:57 AM
OK.
SAT 1:57 AM
Nm. I'm okay.
SAT 1:58 AM
For a second, I thought I just got pwned.
SAT 1:58 AM
Wtf?
SAT 1:58 AM
Ikr? lol.
SAT 1:58 AM
BTW. Can you omit this convo from you wiki for the sake of my friend [[h0p3]] and his horrible experience?
SAT 1:59 AM
I'll strip out his section.
SAT 1:59 AM
REDACTED
SAT 1:59 AM
Thank you. It isn't fair to him.
SAT 1:59 AM
Agreed.
SAT 2:00 AM
Fuck Matthew. He knows he's a dumbass.
SAT 2:00 AM
Lol!
SAT 2:00 AM
=)
SAT 2:00 AM
What you about get owned about?
SAT 2:01 AM
You naked watching gay porn again?
SAT 2:01 AM
I regularly give it a try. I can't get into it.
SAT 2:02 AM
Shemales can be hawt though.
SAT 2:02 AM
I won't press. But ok. My anxiety always thinks the worst. Like kiddo getting hurt or somwthing
SAT 2:03 AM
There are some really good looking she ales that would fool anyone.
SAT 2:03 AM
Shemales
SAT 2:04 AM
I have had few kiss me on the cheek in Thailand.
SAT 2:04 AM
They were hotter than 90% of the girls.
SAT 2:04 AM
I wonder if it is a choice for $ or sexual preference over there
SAT 2:05 AM
I can see in the US. It is definitely a choice for sexual and gender preference.
SAT 2:05 AM
Image attached to message
SAT 2:07 AM
Lol, yeah.
SAT 2:07 AM
My opinion, which is abhorrent to many people, is that females have the opportunity to be 1000x more sensitive to male suitor income. Essentially, the demand for attractive females is so high that portions of the males in our species have evolved to switch brain structures. It reminds me of how sperm counts are falling everywhere, and I think prostate stimulation is also an example of an adaptation to a winner-take-all sexual economy in which many males don't get to mate with females (and this goes for many species).
SAT 2:08 AM
In Thailand, many boys are raped in child prostitution, and it is the only life they know. It is a significant method for upward mobility. It's also wildly more acceptable in that society.
SAT 2:09 AM
MRAs have a point; some feminists recognize those points, and some don't. I don't think it's an idpol issue either. I'm redpilled about sexual markets and admitting that we are mammals.
SAT 2:11 AM
This is hardly the claim that all women are gold-diggers. Far from it.
SAT 2:12 AM
It's a complex issue. I just kinda feel live and let live.
SAT 2:16 AM
Except for the raping children part.
SAT 2:16 AM
Lol
SAT 2:16 AM
It is not among the most important issues I aim to respond to in the end either.
SAT 2:17 AM
We have created this crazy PC frenzy which has soany members in the lbgdqt... Community.
SAT 2:18 AM
We are changing pronouns.
SAT 2:18 AM
It's a neoliberal sideshow to me.
SAT 2:19 AM
It's a vote grab
SAT 2:19 AM
But it is sad to see and be around real homophobics and bigots. I don't get on a soap box to defend. But I dont stick around for the bullshit.
SAT 2:21 AM
Aye. It has been commodified. Conservatives see it as a threat to their identities, and standard liberals (within the artificially narrow Overton window which is way off to the right) can feel like they actually care about inequality when they discuss racial, gender, or sexual orientation discrimination without having to reckon with class war. Basically, it enables two parties control by corporations to control enough people that Leftists voters interested in voting against capitalism have no say (Bernie is hardly a Leftist to me).
SAT 2:22 AM
I think identity politics, in this regard, is a rhetorical sleight of hand to misdirect us from the class war (which is really what I'm most worried about in the end...which is not to say there is no identity-based discrimination we must answer).
SAT 2:23 AM
Meme time!
SAT 2:24 AM
https://i.redd.it/s78ac26a4tv21.jpg
SAT 2:24 AM
Oh, this one nails my point: https://i.redd.it/vehlcgtx9sv21.jpg
SAT 2:24 AM
Indeed. And keeping the class divided is an appropriate way to minimize any real call to arms to overthrow the overzealous govt
SAT 2:24 AM
Haha. Love it.
SAT 2:24 AM
Well, I aim to overthrow corporate control of our government. That corruption is the problem. I wouldn't say our government is overzealous...it's not a government. It's an oligarghic theater in which we act like this is democracy.
SAT 2:26 AM
One day, I will need to make it rain memes for you.
SAT 2:26 AM
I spoke on the corruption earlier. It is indeeddriven by lobbyist.
SAT 2:27 AM
I probably have several hundred solid ones sitting in my [[Link Log]].
SAT 2:27 AM
Aye.
SAT 2:27 AM
Show me a politician who will legalize weed and let me keep my guns. I'll vote and buy a t shirt.
SAT 2:27 AM
Yuck.
SAT 2:28 AM
Lmao
SAT 2:28 AM
That's not even close.
SAT 2:28 AM
But, I want both of those too.
SAT 2:28 AM
I vote for my wife everytime now.
SAT 2:28 AM
It hasn't landed me any more sex, unfortunately.
SAT 2:28 AM
Hahah.
SAT 2:28 AM
I love how guys at work give me mad shit for going to Berea.
SAT 2:29 AM
Cause only gays go there.
SAT 2:29 AM
Then have the audacity to ask me who I voted for.
SAT 2:29 AM
Like we go in a booth to vote.
SAT 2:29 AM
I didn't vote the past few elections. I didn't want the blame.
SAT 2:30 AM
I did like McCains run on medical insurance opening up across state lines and increasing competition.
SAT 2:31 AM
But. We are not down to like 4 major carriers now.
SAT 2:31 AM
That was accelerated by the ACA.
SAT 2:32 AM
(my conspiracy is that they did that to piss everyone off so bad we would vote for a single payer system.
SAT 2:33 AM
And I'm there.
SAT 2:33 AM
Fuck it.
SAT 2:33 AM
That conspiracy makes no sense to me. I think Obama is just plainly a conservative interested in maximizing the profits of the wealthy (and a war criminal to boot...just like every president, including Carter).
SAT 2:34 AM
Cmon. Carter was the most honest president we have ever had.
SAT 2:34 AM
I wish I were wrong. =/
SAT 2:35 AM
In any case, it's late. I need to jack off. So, goodnight. I'll be thinking of you, of course.
SAT 2:35 AM
I didn't think  conspiracys were suppose to make sense.
SAT 2:35 AM
Cause half the shit I see doesnt
SAT 2:36 AM
Have a good night you flat earther.
SAT 2:36 AM
Lmao
SAT 2:36 AM
Do you know the requirements to be a teacher in Tennessee?
SAT 1:22 PM
Still searching for a method to become certified without years more of school for credentials I don't value.
SAT 2:02 PM
Are they like Kentucky who require a year if student teaching.
SAT 2:02 PM
They do, but that can be gotten around. It depends on the certification percentage in the county (since they can take on a specific number).
SAT 2:03 PM
I live close enough to tenn I could commute. I was curious. Tried looking it up once. But was not good.
SAT 2:04 PM
Do you know a https://www.kickscondor.com?
SAT 4:10 PM
