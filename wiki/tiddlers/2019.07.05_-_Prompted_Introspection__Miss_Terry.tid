title: 2019.07.05 - Prompted Introspection: Miss Terry

!! Describe when someone has done something very nice for you.

I have had so many people do nice things for me in my life. Nice, of course, is not the same thing as kind. I've also had so many people do kind things for me. I'm grateful and I regret that I have forgotten or failed to keep a full accounting of the [[Humanity]] I've encountered. 

Miss Terry^^tm^^<<ref "c">> did a kindness for my donors and me by babysitting us on Sunday mornings, free of charge, for years. There's a 6-year gap between we three musketeers, and her daughters were about 6 years older than us. I have always been a handful, even in politeness. We are high-strung, annoying as fuck, and she handled us well. I've seen her over the years. I will never be able to communicate to her effectively why I'm so grateful to her. Worse, I am convinced she would not value what I am grateful for, who I have become, and the implications of the webs of relationships between us over decades. It is okay. She loved us, and we are not easy to love. I hope to do the same for [[others]].

<<footnotes "c" "That's how you know I'm from the American South. I'm a grown ass man, and I wouldn't dream of calling her anything other than Miss Terry. There are few humans on this planet who have earned an honorific from me. I won't be able to repay her.">>
