!! Review:

* I'm pretty sure that [[h0p3's Log]] this month helped me realize that I need templates and more logs. It helped me see the value in at least attempting to be systematic and disciplined in having a conversation with myself.
* I think it helped me reflect a lot. It was hit-or-miss in helping motivate me in my daily life.
* It clearly evolved over the month. I'm not sure what else I can do to improve upon the process, but I will keep my eyes open. I can see it is valuable.
* I had a serious dip in my depression, and this was due to not taking DCK. It got worse in the middle of the month. It was a huge mistake to stop taking DCK for so long. My brother [[JRE]] says it is quite common for people to stop taking their meds because they feel fine. The various anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds I've taken didn't actually work, but DCK did. I was actually better. But, at the same time, because I felt better, and because DCK can be a struggle, I felt I could do without. Eventually, I do want to take myself off it. I need to get myself to a place where I'm happy with life though. I'm not there yet. I can, of course, afford to not use DCK for a week or two to pass a drug test. However, I should not go off it completely at this point. I was able to successfully drop cannabis without serious consequences.
* My sleep schedule has improved with DCK. If I'm consistently not sleeping well, that is a sign that something is wrong. ARE YOU LISTENING!? 
* I'm hoping that meeting with my parents in a couple weeks will go well and have a positive impact on our lives.
* I'm so happy I've been reflecting like this. I don't always have something to say every day. But, it has been useful. I'm so grateful to myself for taking the time to do this.
