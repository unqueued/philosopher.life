Aye, lol. Thank you for the braincandy, a show fit for when I'm in my silly state while overly sleepy or drunk. It seems like [[Duck Dynasty|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE41LGC_zfw]] meets [[Blair Witch|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=girSv9UH_V8]] meets [[The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdPWcEVFpzc]] (or something like that).

Also, have you ever saw Sean of the Dead? ITs a zombie parody movie which is fucking hilarious!!! I think you would love the snarky English humor.

Heck yeah! I am a fan: [[Film: Library]]. That movie is glorious, a trope machine, and something I can enjoy for a pick-me-up. I'm struck by its optimism.

I try British shows out here and there. My old neighbor [[Gary]] and his family seemed to watch them a ton; it's great to share our interests. No doubt, I adore snark; I have to catch myself constantly because I live in snark so much that it deauthenticates, overreduces, or hurts myself or [[others]] too much (which is hardly the claim I succeed). 

From my [[TV: Library]], I would recommend //Peep Show//. The cringe is so strong, I have to pause the show and walk away. It is humor that unfolds into horror.

How is //Rick and Morty// going, homie? You've been insanely busy, so it would be a miracle if you've been able to watch any. I'll probably see you at work tonight to talk about it. See you then. =)
