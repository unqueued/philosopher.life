MON 9:17 PM
Best Easter song ever.
MON 9:17 PM
Thank you for sharing. =)
MON 9:20 PM
Intended for a laugh. The ceramic sheep. Had me rolling. Guys dad was a pastor. He's got some. God songs put.
MON 9:21 PM
Out
MON 9:21 PM
Good*lol
MON 9:24 PM
You seemed interested in [[Drunkillfuck]]. I took deschloroketamine yesterday and tried to write without leaving the k-hole (like coming up for air and diving back in). https://philosopher.life/#2019.04.21%20-%20%2Fb%2F
MON 9:27 PM
I'm afraid to look!
MON 9:27 PM
It's gibberish.
MON 9:28 PM
Lol. I never wrote well intoxicated.
MON 9:28 PM
Only could do. Math. Hah. Explain that.
MON 9:29 PM
I have no idea why.
MON 9:31 PM
Wasn't a question I expected an answer to! Lol. Resisting the urge to go to the liquor store. Wife is asleep, kid is asleep. I haven't drank since in like 3 weeks.
MON 9:33 PM
That is a solid distance to achieve.
MON 9:34 PM
I can't recall the last time I went that long.
MON 9:34 PM
Shit. I've done years.
MON 9:35 PM
I'm also a recovering alcoholic. So it makes sense.
MON 9:36 PM
I'd rather just smoke a bowl. But I do not have that option.
MON 9:36 PM
=/
MON 9:36 PM
I hear that, homie.
MON 9:36 PM

MON 9:37 PM
This made me think of a comment you made the other day.
MON 9:37 PM
My life.
MON 9:37 PM
Hah.
MON 9:37 PM
I am slowly getting my libido back. After nearly two years of kratom.
MON 9:37 PM
Noice!
MON 9:37 PM
I could still perform. But never had the desire.
MON 9:37 PM
May you never pee straight again.
MON 9:38 PM
And if high on kratom too much I could beat it till my arms cramped up and still not ejaculated.
MON 9:38 PM
It was fun the first time or two. But really just a hassle and embarrassing.
MON 9:39 PM
After awhile.
MON 9:39 PM
Wife caught me =(
MON 9:56 PM
Jerking off?
MON 9:56 PM
Beer run
MON 10:00 PM
Ah.
MON 10:00 PM
She's lookin out for you.
MON 10:00 PM
She is not a dumb woman. She has a lot of self-interest wrapped up in my sobriety.
MON 10:01 PM
Alcohol has saved my life many times. But it has but my life in danger many more times than It has saved it.
MON 10:04 PM
I have zero room to talk, sir. I am listening.
MON 10:05 PM
At one point it was divorce or alcohol
MON 10:05 PM
I do not know your wife at all. I suggest it is possible that even if it were not in best self-interest, she might still be quite insistent on your sobriety.
MON 10:07 PM
(I have no idea if she would like to get to know me; I'm not an easy person to speak with though. She is free to do so though.)
MON 10:08 PM
I talked about visiting you and your fam.
MON 10:15 PM
I suspect our wife's and kiddos would get along well.
MON 10:15 PM
As would you and I. In an evening style visit. (we would not stay overnight)
MON 10:16 PM
Have a pool, could BBQ out here too. Our place is very small, but you are free to crash here too.
MON 10:16 PM
That would. Be fun! But we would get a hotel. (i don't even stay with my parents) lol
MON 10:21 PM
I am. Thinking/planning a visit to see kilcoyn in Nashville. Maybe this coming weekend.
MON 10:21 PM
We use to throw parties alot. When we were younger. But I often got to intoxicated and biligerant.
MON 10:25 PM
I ran alot of my wife's old friends off. (in my defence they were not quality people and most have since done nothing but drugs in their life, jail, rehab, repeat)
MON 10:26 PM
I have always considered myself a strong judge of character of people. And generally I am right. But I have been grossly wrong on more than one occasion.
MON 10:27 PM
Judging is hard to do well.
MON 10:28 PM
I've resorted to collecting threads and building [[hyperconversation]] worms and fabrics of my relationships with people. My memory is just not good enough otherwise.
MON 10:29 PM
Wtf is a hyper conversation?
MON 10:30 PM
I rely on my intuition for judgment of people far more than just conversation
MON 10:31 PM
Haha. I just took a shot of gin and some of it came out my nose.
MON 10:32 PM
https://philosopher.life/#hyperconversation:hyperconversation%20Sphygmus%20kickscondor
MON 10:32 PM
Definition and two examples.
MON 10:32 PM
Of course, I rely upon my intuition as well.
MON 10:33 PM
I can't escape relying upon it to some degree.
MON 10:33 PM
I have read you consider yourself a deist. I have always been fascinated by the idea of this. But struggle with how I'm suppose to believe in Jesus for my ticket to heaven. But heaven is suppose to be on earth. According to scripture.
MON 10:34 PM
That does not require a response.
MON 10:34 PM
Lol
MON 10:34 PM
I take Jesus' words extremely seriously. I simply don't think he's the Son of God, a member of the Holy Trinity, or The Messiah^^tm^^. I don't believe in heaven, but I stopped believing in that during college as well when I was stripping my faith down to the fundamentals. I agree that a fitting reading of scripture will demonstrate that we must ignore the question of heaven except insofar as it is the construction of Heaven on Earth.
MON 10:37 PM
Doesn't require a response, but you get one anyway. =)
MON 10:37 PM
It has been the safety net sold to. Me by all of my family. My whole life.
MON 10:38 PM
I say "I'll keep you in my prayer" but I don't pray.
MON 10:39 PM
Except when someone is about to die or so. Etching dramatic.
MON 10:39 PM
Something dramatic.
MON 10:39 PM
Easter Sunday was a 2hr service for me and I could not have been more uncomfortable.
MON 10:40 PM
I hear that.
MON 10:40 PM
I want to slit throats when I'm in church.
MON 10:41 PM
I have to go walk it off.
MON 10:41 PM
I hate that feeling. I appreciate someone who is studied. Someone who has a PhD in simenary, who is more educated and articulate and doesn't spend every sermon from the gospels
MON 10:42 PM
But the southern Baptist is pumping out preachers from literal Bible schools like auctioneers for baptisms.
MON 10:43 PM
I can't talk to the wife about it. Cause she enjoys the services.
MON 10:43 PM
In the 90's, before Falwell took over, Southern Baptist Theological was right up there with Yale.
MON 10:44 PM
Ah. She probably would not like me one bit, lol.
MON 10:44 PM
i talk about you alot. so she had an idea of you.
MON 10:45 PM
meh. i am "fallen" from my faith.
MON 10:46 PM
but ive been "saved". i was baptized as a baby, methodist.
MON 10:47 PM
Killcoin and I had a discussion about Baptism yesterday.
MON 10:47 PM
saved  as a small child. crying myself to sleep for several days. due extensive scare tactics of hell and damnation.
MON 10:48 PM
i did this myself. alone in the top bunk of my bex.
MON 10:48 PM
bed. so it was a "spiritural moment"
MON 10:48 PM
so i got a safety net.
MON 10:48 PM
i spent middle school and high school going to 3 different churches.
MON 10:49 PM
part of HS
MON 10:49 PM
i was highly involved in bringing people to a specific network and church and their youth group.
MON 10:50 PM
literally tripled its size because of me.
MON 10:50 PM
untill one of our youth ministers told me that he watch through the power of prayer children with cleft palets were healed right in front of him
MON 10:51 PM
then my stepfather got drunk the same week and told my mom that i ruined all his dreams for life.
MON 10:51 PM
while i was in the other room.
MON 10:51 PM
after i spent all night at a church lock in, then played a double header in soccer.
MON 10:52 PM
then came home and cut our grass with a push mower.
MON 10:52 PM
lol
MON 10:52 PM
TMI. i know.
MON 10:52 PM
i lost a lot of faith that week.
MON 10:52 PM
Naw. That's what we do as friends. We reveal ourselves to each other.
MON 10:52 PM
its mostly one sided.
MON 10:53 PM
i talk alot and you listen.
MON 10:53 PM
You don't try to listen to me, lol.
MON 10:53 PM
:P
MON 10:53 PM
My wiki is what I'm saying to you.
MON 10:53 PM
i would argue i probably have and do read your wiki more than you suspect.
MON 10:54 PM
That's probably true. I'm not able to gauge that (or, rather, I'm not going to implement tools for doing that).
MON 10:54 PM
i appriciated the edit to you time at "berea" to include ping pong trent and kilcoyn
MON 10:55 PM
Aye. Made me who I am.
MON 10:55 PM
sadly, it was an afterthought.
MON 10:56 PM
I think you also forgot racquetball.
MON 10:56 PM
Well, my {[[Vault]]} is just a skeleton. You'll find far more of my past in other places in the wiki, e.g. [[Prompted Introspection]]. I talked about racquetball this month in that log.
MON 10:58 PM
As I said, {[[Vault]]} is atrocious.
MON 10:58 PM
It's going to take a lifetime to piece that together.
MON 10:58 PM
i enjoy your prompted introspections . the ones i understand.
MON 10:58 PM
to be honest.
MON 10:59 PM
i told my wife I have a draw to your wiki. cause someone, someday, is gonna have to sort thru all that bullshit to create the new york times best seller.
MON 10:59 PM
:)
MON 11:00 PM
roflmao
MON 11:00 PM
lol
MON 11:00 PM
May you be immortalized, sir.
MON 11:00 PM
your wife sure aint gonna do it.
MON 11:00 PM
And, to whomever wades through the bullshit: thank you! =)
MON 11:00 PM
your kids will want the Money, of course they can have it all . it is owed to them
MON 11:01 PM
but i feel a pull to the shit the average man can understand.
MON 11:01 PM
My work cannot effectively be copyrighted.
MON 11:02 PM
and it is there. hidden. between the lines.
MON 11:02 PM
brilliance.
MON 11:02 PM
Well, thank you. Hopefully it amounts to something useful. Lol.
MON 11:02 PM
https://j3d1h.philosopher.life/ -- Daughter
MON 11:03 PM
i speak with humor, laughter, sincerity, and alcohol.

MON 11:03 PM
Son, and then wife.
MON 11:03 PM
im afraid the links did not work
MON 11:04 PM
Oh, yeah!
MON 11:04 PM
no https, just http
MON 11:04 PM
and i dont know if i have the energy to read your spawn, your spouse,
MON 11:04 PM
i will glace. as i do will all things. half ass.
MON 11:05 PM
as vonnegut said "if you can do a halfass job of anything, you are a one eyed man in the kingdom of the blind"
MON 11:05 PM
i took this to heart.
MON 11:05 PM
lmao
MON 11:05 PM
Lol.
MON 11:06 PM
so as a young adult i worked for sarah juenegst and her husband
MON 11:07 PM
she was a prespreterian minister and he was an antropologist.
MON 11:07 PM
they were missionaries in the congo for many years, including having children there.
MON 11:07 PM
also refugees during a civil war.
MON 11:08 PM
Not an easy place to have children.
MON 11:08 PM
i worked for them daily from about 14 years old until about 17
MON 11:08 PM
during the summer i worked full days.
MON 11:08 PM
during school i worked after school.
MON 11:09 PM
they bought 3 very old homes around theirs in a small community in SC.
MON 11:09 PM
I did everything from trim hedges to tear down barns build their grand children an awesome tree house to rebuild a cabin.
MON 11:10 PM
along with basic lawn maintenace, gardening and the like.
MON 11:10 PM
amazing people. biggest religious influence on my life at that age/
MON 11:11 PM
i am quoted in one of her books.
MON 11:11 PM
Neat. =)
MON 11:11 PM
closest i will ever get to publication!
MON 11:11 PM
lol
MON 11:11 PM
i remember smoking weed in morning on the way there.
MON 11:12 PM
taking xanax after lunch and chuging beer they had in the garage fridge.
MON 11:12 PM
during my work day.
MON 11:12 PM
lol.
MON 11:12 PM
I think posting your thoughts online is publishing.
MON 11:12 PM
Cool that they let the beer slide, lol.
MON 11:13 PM
they didnt count them. and i doubt they cared if they found out.
MON 11:13 PM
i sat down and ate lunch with them everyday. she would literally make it a meal. put the bread on a plate, lunch meat, but the mayo in a bowl.
MON 11:14 PM
every day!
MON 11:14 PM
i never knew pumperkickle bread existed until they showed me! hahaha
MON 11:14 PM
the good old days.
MON 11:15 PM
i left to go to work in the local lawn mower small engine mechanic shop
MON 11:15 PM
That was the only job I knew you had in college.
MON 11:15 PM
and i was replaced with a local painter who just never measured up to my work ethic according to them. haha
MON 11:15 PM
i took advantage of them. i would take naps on the job.
MON 11:16 PM
but i was young, i worked hard to make up lost time.
MON 11:16 PM
I am not convinced you took advantage of them.
MON 11:16 PM
But, I'm a Marxist.
MON 11:16 PM
i am just not educated enough to understand it.
MON 11:17 PM
You could if you wanted.
MON 11:18 PM
my mind is not nearly as malleable.
MON 11:18 PM
That is probably true. We crystallize over time.
MON 11:18 PM
Our emotional modeling of the world is habituated so as not be to surprised (which doesn't make it accurate or right).
MON 11:18 PM
history in itself has not been kind to the ideas of socialism and communism.
MON 11:19 PM
It's part of why time appears to speed up in our [[phenomenology]].
MON 11:19 PM
I suppose it depends on what you mean by "kind to."
MON 11:19 PM
I agree that capitalists have fought tooth and nail to maintain their capital.
MON 11:20 PM
Anyway, you start back in a couple weeks. What do you think will be different?
MON 11:21 PM
good time for a subject change
MON 11:22 PM
that was a perfect social cue you picked up on
MON 11:22 PM
good job.
MON 11:22 PM
hahah
MON 11:22 PM
Lol. I'm trying to spare you the embarrassment. =)
MON 11:22 PM
Thank you for complimenting my awareness though!
MON 11:22 PM
You need to take a shot at my arrogance now.
MON 11:22 PM
Then the circle will be complete.
MON 11:23 PM
I ever tell you that Dr. Duane Smith took a pile of books and slammed them down on the table (thought it was floor, but my wife corrected me recently on this)? He screamed at me: "you are the most arrogant person I've ever met in my entire life" and stormed out of the classroom.
MON 11:24 PM
That was what led to the first pseudo-date/walk with my wife.
MON 11:24 PM
i have never felt embarrassed around your intelligence... i have felt uneducated. i have felt our witted. but never embarrassed. your arrogance i admired. although your tact was often terrible. I recognized early in our friendship that i was not the intelligent one.
MON 11:25 PM
which is 99% the complete oppsite of my expeerice.
MON 11:25 PM
you challenged me in ways no one dared.
MON 11:26 PM
you stood toe to toe with me on shit that i watched professors stumble over.
MON 11:26 PM
i respected that with my entire being.
MON 11:26 PM
We are good sumbitches together, T-Money.
MON 11:26 PM
granted there were times i could not deal with your bullshit.
MON 11:27 PM
but I was also, unafraid of saying so.
MON 11:27 PM
and i feel the same today.
MON 11:27 PM
it is quite simple "to be a dead horse"
MON 11:28 PM
we came to this most basic of understanding
MON 11:28 PM
if you remember, you may not, i do
MON 11:28 PM
you are, who heartedly sympatetic to the average crack whore
MON 11:28 PM
i am not.
MON 11:28 PM
however, we both agree, without question, the children of said crackwhore are and need to be tended to accordingly.
MON 11:29 PM
Preach.
MON 11:29 PM
this was disscussed many times between you and on very intense discussion from food service back to dana or danforth.
MON 11:30 PM
Yeah. Still having the conversation today these years later, lol.
MON 11:30 PM
we often lost many fellow classmates before we completed dinner.
MON 11:30 PM
Look at what they missed out on!
MON 11:30 PM
Those poor folks.
MON 11:31 PM
i have grown soft, i see the need for rehabilitation and training for the crackwhore
MON 11:31 PM
{blow your mind}
MON 11:31 PM
Lol!
MON 11:31 PM
`/mind-blown`
MON 11:31 PM
but i still see capitolism as the best vehicle to acheive that goal.
MON 11:31 PM
you would hate me, i had a very basic conversation about socialism and capitolism to my child.
MON 11:32 PM
she question why everything could just not be free
MON 11:32 PM
and she got an hour and a half lecture, in children terms, of why
MON 11:33 PM
Lectures are wonderful.
MON 11:33 PM
even in basic terms, is the government the best deciding factor in your position as a citizen?
MON 11:34 PM
and if they choose wrong, what keeps you working as the trash man? when you are a certified zooligist.
MON 11:34 PM
this is the the example i used
MON 11:34 PM
why no juust stay home, and get shit for free
MON 11:35 PM
INCENTIVE
MON 11:35 PM
im poking the bear, but you cant link your fucking wiki
MON 11:35 PM
bitch lmao
MON 11:35 PM
Uh, socialism doesn't require centralized planning beyond the Rule of Law (as does any government though). That is a myth.
MON 11:35 PM
And, if you look at the history of innovation, you will see a ridiculous amount of it has been government funded through the military and public university system.
MON 11:36 PM
Incentives can be generated in many ways.
MON 11:36 PM
if you feel the need to again change subject please do so. liquid courage is real.
MON 11:36 PM
Socialists aren't opposed to markets either!
MON 11:36 PM
Alright, rofl
MON 11:36 PM
Anyway, you start back in a couple weeks. What do you think will be different?
MON 11:37 PM
hahahaha
MON 11:37 PM
ok ok. ill stop.
MON 11:37 PM
5 billion in NASA for velcro
MON 11:37 PM
money well spent
MON 11:37 PM
You bear poker you.
MON 11:37 PM
ok, im done for real this time
MON 11:38 PM
lol
MON 11:38 PM
lol
MON 11:38 PM
fuck you [[h0p3]]. you might know alot of smart dude. but  you will never meet another trent moore
MON 11:38 PM
Lol. That is so true.
MON 11:38 PM
work, eh man. im scared.
MON 11:38 PM
You are one of a kind, sir.
MON 11:38 PM
im afraid i may not be able to do the job. but  one of the senior production planners for one of th eprograms is a former manger college at meggit aircraft braking systems
MON 11:39 PM
i am over qualified for my bosses job
MON 11:40 PM
if i cant work on the helicopters, i can justmove to the office somewhere.
MON 11:40 PM
Office sounds good.
MON 11:40 PM
my boss knows, but my skills are significantly under utilized
MON 11:41 PM
i like being a guy on the floor making 60k a year without overtime.
MON 11:41 PM
its easy, good money and i have minimal compliants.
MON 11:41 PM
but if I stuggle, the guys on the floor dont even realize, my true potential and the positions i have held in the past.
MON 11:42 PM
even still its a 90mile one way trip.
MON 11:42 PM
it is not a sustainable solution.
MON 11:43 PM
Aye. That is rough.
MON 11:44 PM
I have learned to play dumb...
MON 11:45 PM
i have been the golden boy at to many companies and been used for my skills but never compensated. just used.
MON 11:45 PM
so, i play dumb. i dont talk politics or religion. i dont discuss anything much other than normal silly family stuff (basic arcuments with wife and kid who all can identify wity) and work related info.
MON 11:46 PM
but even then i play dumb alot and force others to agree with my decisions or blueprint intrepetations before proceeding.
MON 11:47 PM
the job itself will be a challenge. i plan to spend the next two weeks working up to a 10 hour shift. int he garge.
MON 11:48 PM
practicing squating instead of bending, baisic stuff that would memic my job as well as being on my feet that long. i have came a long way physically
MON 11:49 PM
from being ready to sell the farm to just looking at manual labor and jobs differently.
MON 11:49 PM
i was basically bedridden for the first two weeks of my injury and i am a ticking time bomb
MON 11:50 PM
a wrong move or strech or push could put me in the sugery room.
MON 11:50 PM
Sounds like the surgery is going to come some day.
MON 11:50 PM
if i can buy myself a decade i will be happy
MON 11:51 PM
it, as you recall from a sorrowful drunken state a few weeks back, has been a difficult pill for me to swallow
MON 11:52 PM
but i recall my ability that exceeds my physical limitations.
MON 11:52 PM
and i regain my feeling of stregth.
MON 11:52 PM
i can work MS office better than most managers, i can type memos and letters and emails that  most CEO would be proud to put their name on
MON 11:53 PM
i am a federally certified aircarft mechanic.
MON 11:54 PM
with a bachlors degree
MON 11:54 PM
and i work for lockheed martin.
MON 11:54 PM
im sure they can figure itout. lol.
MON 11:54 PM
the largest defense contractor inthe world.
MON 11:54 PM
and if they cant find me a home fuck em.
MON 11:55 PM
ive quit their once.
MON 11:55 PM
lol
MON 11:55 PM
(i saw an impending layoff and left prior to thelayoff
MON 11:55 PM
i brag too much and it is unbecomming. i apologize.
MON 11:56 PM
Lol. Gotta think about where you are going. Makes sense to me.
MON 11:57 PM
fair enough. (i went from im useless to fuck that im a fucking asset)
MON 11:58 PM
it took a few weeks, but listening to zeizic and peterson lectures
MON 11:58 PM
i reconized how much responsibility i have carrried for so long
MON 11:59 PM
and, i like it, it many way it is the reason i finished college int he first place
MON 11:59 PM
i didnt get a degree for myself, i got it for my future family
MON 11:59 PM
then i did it a second time
MON 11:59 PM
i read peterson and he isnt talking to me...
TUE 12:00 AM
he talking to my stepdad, the guy who never had it like me.
TUE 12:00 AM
fuckedup, my stepdad lost his nursing license due to positive alcohol test during training in TN.
TUE 12:01 AM
while they were traveling nursing
TUE 12:01 AM
so he has fabricated a painful illness that keeeps him from working
TUE 12:02 AM
i got shitfacted. the night i detoxed from kratom. i talked to you
TUE 12:02 AM
i calledhim at 1am
TUE 12:02 AM
and my mom called terrified that i had exposed his secret that he lost his license.
TUE 12:02 AM
but gave me a book on honesty, cleaning your room, and taking responcipility.
TUE 12:03 AM
which he read!
TUE 12:03 AM
=)
TUE 12:03 AM
so difficult to bite my toung.
TUE 12:04 AM
I'm not biting mine.
TUE 12:04 AM
Not done with my first draft yet.
TUE 12:04 AM
Will be epic.
TUE 12:04 AM

TUE 12:04 AM
*donors, yes.
TUE 12:04 AM

TUE 12:04 AM
serio9usly.
TUE 12:04 AM
your parents.
TUE 12:05 AM
yes. it was painful to read
TUE 12:05 AM
all of it.
TUE 12:05 AM

One of my biggest regrets at Berea was leaving the skateboard. You gave me in the common area of Danforth and it going missing.
TUE 12:15 AM
I was in love with Tha board and the awesome longboardbhweels for cruising.
TUE 12:15 AM
Berea was a wonderful time. My kids have "Ripsticks" and they refuse to use them. It's shame. Maybe they'll learn to love skateboarding one day. I have force them to go outside often enough. I don't expect them to be gone all day, but we have some decent forest area around us for them to play in.
TUE 12:18 AM
I'm kinda hoping they go to Berea.
TUE 12:18 AM
