title: 2019.10.16 - Prompted Introspection: Assassinated On Friday

!! If you were principal of this school, what would you do?

I am the principal of our education institution (it's not //really// homeschooling, officially) according to state law. I would work to teach my students to be autodidacts, to teach them to teach themselves to teach themselves, and I would reward their effort rather than results or praise them for that which is outside of their control. My goal is to create critical reasoners, [[Straussian]] readers, leet hackers, skilled philosophers, and adults prepared for a world beyond my understanding to the best of my understanding.
