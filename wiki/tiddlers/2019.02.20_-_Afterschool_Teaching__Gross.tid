title: 2019.02.20 - Afterschool Teaching: Gross

I have to burn through the fresh food before it all goes bad. I had the highschoolers peel the remaining bananas and freeze them for the yonana treats. They were initially unhappy about it, but they seemed to enjoy themselves (plus, they got ice cream sandwiches).

I am the only adult who consistently stays with the kids (that said: Mitchell repeatedly makes good moves). I find that annoying, but that's not up to me. I'm here to help them, and I can be proud of the fact that I do. Still, it may cost me on the social signaling. I'm just not here for that though.

I'm having a difficult time making sure they clean up after themselves. How can I ensure that they leave the cafeteria better than they found it? I don't think I'm going to succeed on this front.

Mitchell took the 5th graders. Whitney and I took the older kids. When Matt showed, he played in the office and talked to the volunteers about not using their phones (I had given them a heads up about it with my usual carefully worded disclaimer). 

I helped 6DC with her homework. Her reading skill is unfortunate. I think she has a good attitude though, and she is easy to encourage. She got a lot of reading and writing done on top of her homework. I spoke with some of the other students, and we had a discussion of what the word //philosophy// means. Most people do not enjoy listening to me, but some are interested (better than I would predict in this case).

I have several students who count on the fact that I want to take kids to the lab. Whitney is happy I take them to the lab, but I think I'm the only adult here who thinks it is a valuable use of their time (even though most of the time they are playing games). All three other adults are involved in school sports, that's how the school brings in money, and that's what really matters about school anyway.

6DM and I talked about why I don't really play video games anymore and what narratives are all about. I think he is lying about being unable to read, but I agree there is something off about his language skills. The kid is smart and different. The other kids do not want to be kind to him, but he lets it bounce off him. I gradually escalate with those who do not obey but snap instantly at unkindness (not the same as not nice) toward others. These are my children. 

I feel fortunate to have kids who want to use computers and speak with me about topics I feel are important. The kids enjoyed my music. 5AE even asked me to sit next to him. I did, we talked, he showed me the story he was building in his game. Cool.

At the end of the day, Matt was concerned that one of the kids had said the "F" word. It was a trying time for him. 

I appeared to be the only person who did the paperwork (or it was already done...which is weird because that is way too early).

After work we had an unpaid meeting in which I listened to 3 adults plan about how to control that *ahem* euphemized "slut" 8MY from spending 2 minutes in the hallway with a 9th grade boy Delp continually allows into the building. It is, of course, my job and legal responsibility to follow her to the bathroom and make sure zero flirting, dancing, or kissing ever occurs because someone is definitely going to get pregnant, sue the school, defamate the institution, and cause everyone to lose their licenses for jobs they don't deserve to have. These adults did a fine job talking shit about the girl's mom and merely virtue signaling to each other; indeed, they really do understand how important it is to be chaste. They spent 15 minutes seriously plotting, thinking about cameras, locking hallways, attempting to entrap these folks, designing secret codes over the intercom/phone, thinking how to scare these teenagers, making sure we don't cause the tattler to lose face, and getting me to sneak out of my classroom of kids to covertly follow this teenager. I have better fucking things to do with my time (like writing about it :P).

I'm all for being judgmental. Let's do this shit. I am wildly overqualified and underpaid.
