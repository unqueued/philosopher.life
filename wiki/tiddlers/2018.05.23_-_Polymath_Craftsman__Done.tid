title: 2018.05.23 - Polymath Craftsman: Done

It rained all morning. We sat there. We cleaned up, used our seeding machine, and I felt ill. About an hour before we were done, I called it. Colton said we were getting layed off anyways, and he'd have the check mailed to me.

Goodbye.

Will file for unemployment in a week. I believe I should be able to receive it.
