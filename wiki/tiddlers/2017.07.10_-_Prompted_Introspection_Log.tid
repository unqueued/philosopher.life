!! Why don't you like "Mr. Robot" as much as I would expect?

I'm not sure. I'm currently planning to watch and analyze it. I'm going through the technical flaws. If I'm not satisfied with that, then I'll look for other narrative flaws. There are so many cartoonish aspects of the show on top of a lack of unrealism in a way. It feels like an uncanny valley of some sort. They tried to add realism, but in doing so, they only exposed an area that somehow feels even less real to me.

I'm thinking that fiction needs to stay out of this uncanny valley. It needs to go for broke on its cartoonishness or its realism. There is a vicious black mean here (rather than a golden one). It seems like there are two golden means. That is quite odd.
