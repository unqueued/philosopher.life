!! About:

//Hello stranger, outsider, desert nomad, alien, Other, and possible friend. I hope to be hospitable to you. I flee from those who consistently make me feel all alone with nothing to show for it. Seriously, let's be friends.//

Become Socrates, sir.

This is a Diamond in the Redpilled Art. This is where I find merit in constructing society, in being social, in being a good citizen of humanity. This is about finding the Kantian flavors residing in humanity, those meme-carriers who are truly doing their moral best, the sufficiently virtuous  Fastminded of them all in a sense. 

I seek at least reciprocal altruists and people I can learn from. 

As you can guess, I'm trying to "Find The Others." Approaches

* Sift Humanity for those who speak my dialects and values.
** I have a narrow scope of humanity that really speaks my language, that are composed in such a way that we can both effectively empathize with each other, that are people that I can be deep friends with. I'm looking for meaningful friendships, those which define who I am. Sometimes it's only one way though (e.g. they might be dead). This is definitely an oddity.
*** This is clearly focused on the rational in me; rationality as I see it as directly as I can.
* Actively and hospitably pursue the rational aliens (not literal aliens, obviously) among us.
** In the humble pursuit of the Original Position, I pursue "The Others." I'm the corrected Bene Gesserit: I sift humans for persons, even if we don't get along. I seek the Rational in all of us.
*** This is clearly focused on the rationality in others, trustingly accepting their hearsay and providing them shelter, having faith in those I meet.

Seeking Diamonds and Redpills in the world includes finding the human beings who are Diamonds and Redpills. Those who are ends in themselves, those who are instrumental to my life, etc.

It's just a fact that I can't ultimately care what everyone thinks. I have to pursue the approval of those whose approval actually has merit. I'm seeking the approval of ideal persons, however impossible that may be.

Uploading my mind into my wiki gives me data to digest and perceive in such a way that I have a higher chance of developing more accurate models of myself, i.e. empathizing with computational theories of my mind. I don't know of a better way for an autist to Find The Other in themselves. Likewise, I'm searching for others, attempting to cognitively develop accurate theories of their minds, building trust and friendship. Let's do this!

Reminds me strongly of gnostic, cultic, remnant, "Chosen" mentality.
