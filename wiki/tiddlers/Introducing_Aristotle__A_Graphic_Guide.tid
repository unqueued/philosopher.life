They've done a great job for an intro. My problem, of course, is their turn to non-cognitivism for virtue theory. Aristotle clearly points to something else in his metaphysics. Yes, emotions must be trained: through reason!

All praise the author! They deliver the Marxist critique. `/bow` You've got it. Thank you. The Ideology is conceptually linked to false consciousness is annoying to me, but I get it.

I cannot say I agree with Aristotle's position on Poetry's universality vs. History's particularity. Poetry may be so subjective and ephemeral, it may be uninterpretable to the point of borderline qualia and private language, it may be far more particular as phenomenology than historical interpretation about facts of the world. It's obviously an important kind of question. As usual, my teacher sees so far ahead of me; I will probably never catch up.

The last pages are dedicated to the giants who stood on his shoulders responding to him. It's hard to condense it, but I'm fine with it. This was a first-rate introduction to the "standard" model of him (which is obviously wrong, folks). I've never seen anything like it. It moved a zillion miles an hour, made some un[[Straussian]] mistakes, failed to dig into his metaphysics and metaethics as the real centerpieces, but at least glossed over it. My offspring are going to read this.
