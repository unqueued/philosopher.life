Matt and Delp are gone today. Matt is on vacation for the week.

Whitney passed her classes. Yay! =) She looked happy and exhausted.

Mitchell didn't show until late, so I took everyone for a while. Stragglers for homework from all the grades. I had several students hush everyone for me, which is nice. I took everyone with homework and the usual library crew. The tohers went to the gym.

6CM was unhappy about having to work her math problems by hand (I'm an assohole, I know, kid). I showed her some ways to do it in her head too; I'm sure she will appreciate shortcuts. 

8CH hurt her ankle rough-housing. I keep having to draw lines here with the chillun. 9AM and I took care of her. 

Mitchell looks exceptionally frustrated or busy today on his phone.

We discussed a wide variety of topics. From rap, to human sexual reproductive slang terminology, to grammar, to all over the place.

5CM is distraught today. He promised not to lose a notebook his mom bought him, and he lost it. Ouch. We traced his steps, but still no go. I tried cheering him up and keeping his mind busy on something productive. I hope he doesn't get in too much trouble.

Having to wrestle with 8Hm a good deal today. He is more outspoken. He did, however, complete his homework (without much fuss either).

The lab was super talkative.
