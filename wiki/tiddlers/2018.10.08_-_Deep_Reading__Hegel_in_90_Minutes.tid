title: 2018.10.08 - Deep Reading: Hegel in 90 Minutes

Short, cute, crystalline.

I think Hegel would adore my "excerpt mill" in this wiki. Also, he'd appreciate how my "lecturing style is as wretched as [my] literary style." Brothers!

This book is fucking hilarious! This is how philosophy needs to be done. Comedy, fist in the glove, the rhetoric necessary to make us swallow the facts to help us build the real stuff. It's unstoppably humorous.

I'm going to drown both Kant and Hegel with my prolix style. =)

It's a shame he doesn't like legit logic. He may be correct that it fails to do what we hope, but I think Gödel is a powerful force! I cannot answer this question about the separation/relation of form and content. Perhaps it's dialectical ;P.

I think there exist things which are not [[The Good]]. 

Do dialectics have to be between opposites, or can contraries work together?

What is the opposite of Absolute Spirit? Does the triad it forms go into infinity, it is that infinite thing? Is this the being Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, and Gödel point to? So...Absolute Idea, Nature, and then Absolute Spirit/Reality...And, why does it not continue? Why does it unify? I think [[The Dialetheia]] must show up to answer for us.

"Mind is the ultimate reality." God damn idealists. The [[Straussian]] in see something extremely constructive in their skepticism, and I applaud it! What is mind? You don't get to help yourself to that at this level. 

Do I think [[The Good]] is a mind? Fuck me. I have no idea! It's transcendent. I don't think my Xeon processor is a mind, but I think it computes. I think Spinoza is closer to the mark here. Instead of self-thinking thing thinking about itself, I'd say self-computing thing computing itself (and everything else).

There is a difference between the representation of "The World" in our minds and The World itself. The correlation issue must be resolved into the infinite.

"The Metaphysics of Metaphysics." - Gorgeous, and I have no idea what it means. 

I just don't see why this leads to self-realization of the unified Absolute object for which only it is its own subject. Why should I agree that "it perceives" itself. Look, the hard problem of consciousness, dualism redeux can't be solved. It's a conceptual problem of doubt. OOO is there as well. I can't help you with this. I do not see why my doubt is less warranted than your belief.

This book took me much longer than 90 minutes. Several points required digestion and being reminded of a wealth of thought. It's history of philosophy that touches the right stones. Fun portions at the end too!
