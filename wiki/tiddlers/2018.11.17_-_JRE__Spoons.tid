My brother has two events to attend today. He's attending [[L]]'s birthday party (awesome). He's also attending a get together with in-laws (boo). They are going to ask about Raylan, and this is something they've mentally rehearsed/experienced in advance (which is not a claim to predictive accuracy). Clearly, it will be very emotional. The good news is that a socialist cousin who swears like a sailor will be there, and they've adopted before. I hope they connect more.

I talked about [[Spoon Theory|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory]]. I didn't know the origins, but my brother knew what I was saying immediately. That's neat.

We talked about my brother's book more. It sounds like The Old one creates Jesus. It's fascinating to hear my brother's description which packs details I didn't understand before.

My brother talked about the E.T. post. I think he liked the art. Cool.
