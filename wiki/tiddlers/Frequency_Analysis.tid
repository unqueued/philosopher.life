title: Frequency Analysis

//I'm thinking about defining the most common words in English and/or this wiki, one per day. This has been a valuable reading hack in my experience, and I'm in no position to say it won't be useful far down the line. I don't know how to do it well. It needs a process I can feasibly design and implement. The question is: do I go for complete linkage (fucking insane madcap; in ~3 years I could link ~40% of the words on this wiki) or pick my battles in select terms (or is this that!?)? The fork is ugly here. I lean toward: NO! So many other words seem more [[salient]] to me.//
