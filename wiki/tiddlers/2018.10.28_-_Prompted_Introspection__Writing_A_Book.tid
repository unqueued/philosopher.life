title: 2018.10.28 - Prompted Introspection: Writing A Book

!! If you were to write a book, would it be fiction or non-fiction? What would the subject be? Who is your target audience?

This wiki is much greater than a book to me. I'd shoot for non-fiction. The subject and audience would be those which mattered most to me. 

If I had to write a book, I think I'd shoot for a science fiction novel or a political philosophy book. I'm not sure which. I'd aim to express [[The Original Position]] and beyond as effectively as I could. I don't know how much time I really have. Estimates are rolling in, and it looks bleak as fuck.
