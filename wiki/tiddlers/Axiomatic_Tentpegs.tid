//Here I have my Platonic cake and eat it too.//




Consciousness is awareness of our representations of meaning. That we question our reality is Daseinic.

Meaning can be reductively represented in bits, but I make no claims to this reduction being physical. 

 
**** A bit is the smallest deterministic unit of meaning. It is the atomic unit of meaning. Molecular units of meaning can be arbitrarily large.
**** Probabilistic meaning down to the infinitesimal enables meaning between 0 and 1 bits. I shall call these shannonbits, and I lazily assume them whenever I'm talking about bits.




Objects are the storage loci of meanings. My mind in an object comprised of other objects, and meanings are found in these objects. Interpretation is a process of generating meaning results by applying meaning functions to meaning inputs.

*** The transmission of meaning
*** The interpretation of meaning
*** The locus of meaning



*** An object may have multiple meaning property sets.
*** Two different objects may instantiate the same meaning.


** The object may directly emit this meaning to a language user, but a language user can acquire the meaning through other methods.
*** The possibility of communication, of course, does not require the meaning to be directly communicated from object to subject to be meaningful. Meaning can also be indirectly acquired through deductive or inductive processes. Meaning can be even guessed (that doesn't mean the language user is justified).
** Objects obviously can be molecular and arbitrarily complex relationships or networks of objects.
*** Objects need not be physical, they may be metaphysical.
** Meaning precedes language users. 
*** Meaning exists even if we are not aware of it. It exists without someone to express or interpret it.
*** There may be meanings for which there are no actual interpreters alive to interpret them.
*** Meaning is not a relationship, but simply the possibility of a relationship.
** Language users can know the meaning in itself, but subjective interpretation or perception of meaning tends to be fallible. Even if we do know the meaning in itself, we can never know with certainty. The ever empirical Bayesians are largely correct in claiming we only build confidence intervals in our interpretations of meaning.

** Coherentist Meaning
*** Coherence is when bits relates to each other according to some standard, usually through logical consistency and mutual inferential support.
**** A standard is meaningful, and thus its meaning is reducible to a set of bits.
*** Coherence is ordered bits about bits (second about first order, and so on). These bits of meaning correspond to each other in particular ways, and if using some external kind of standard of coherence, ultimately to that external standard (itself a meaning) as well.
**** Obviously, coherence is innately algorithmic beyond simple interpretation. 
*** Clearly, new (and quite valuable) meanings emerge from coherence.
*** Crucially, coherentist meaning is reducible to correspondentist meaning.

** Constructivist Meaning
*** Language users, to some extent, must maintain meanings in their minds in order to compute them. They must have memory of meanings, even if only temporarily in many cases. Those memories are objects, objects with information property (and so on). Therefore, meanings exist in language users' minds.
**** This is not the claim, however, that meaning only exists in language users minds. 
*** Language users can construct meanings and communicate those new meanings to others.
*** Two language users can instantiate the same meaning in their minds.
*** It is possible for language users to never know the thing in itself, to lack certainty in access to the external, transcendent, or objective meaning while meaning obtain in objects external to minds. 
**** What is it they are apprehending if it is not meaning external to them? Do they really believe they constructed A=A, that such a thing has no meaning unless their is a mind which computes it?
*** Constructivism is ultimately relativistic and solipstic. It is a form of ad hoc skepticism, and it is not the simplest explanation.
*** Empiricism relies upon correspondentist meaning.
*** All of this is compatible with and reducible to correpondentist meaning.

** Consensist Meaning
*** This kind of meaning is fundamental to intersubjective meaning, probabilistic golden-rule reasoning, reflective equilibirum processes in the original position or the Categorical Imperative, decentralizing power, trust-based meaning, and the wisdom of the crowd (as well as the flaws of appealing to the bandwagon). It's extremely valuable.
*** Unfortunately, it cannot be the atom of meaning. It is a powerful heuristic in a number of applications, but clearly, even group-based constructivist meaning is reducible to a complex object with correspondentist meaning.







* Consciousness requires a language user who is aware of their own communication of meaning to their own minds.



The principle of sufficient reason takes us into metaphysics.

* Ontological Substance Dualism: Physics & Metaphysics
** Metaphysics is external to our physical universe. Thus, I deny Physicalism.
** We know (with confidence and perhaps without any certainty) precious little about metaphysics.
** What counts as metaphysics may be a plurality of substances and/or universes, but it is beyond our ability to know. Hence, I lump them all into one category.
** Metaphysics affects the physical universe, but I do not know if it goes the other way.

* Consciousnesses we can know about, including our own, are epiphenomenal by-products of physical processes.
** I cannot make claims about metaphysical consciousness.
** I'm highly sympathetic to Materialism, but I believe metaphysics exists (even if I don't think our consciounesses are metaphysical).


* An object is physically determined //iff// it is physically possible (however impractical or implausible) for a physical observer to know it obtained.

* Some degree of determinism obtains in the physical universe.
** We cannot be certain of that by definition, but it is my faith.

* To the degree that an object is not truly random (as opposed to pseudo-randomness or deterministic chaos), it bears meaning and emits objective information.
** The higher degree of determinism (ontic property), the higher degree we can make meaningful determinations (epistemic property) about it.
** Even probabilistic physics can bear meaning, but it isn't as stable or perhaps as meaningful. 
** I'm aiming for causal agnosticism in my claim. Essentially, I'm interested in whether or not an object is determined, rather than if or how something determined it.

* Axioms:
*# [[The Good]] and Being are not identical.
*# Symbiotically, [[The Good]] provides meaning to Being, and Being provides existence to [[The Good]].
*# [[The Good]] is an internal part/subset of Being.
*# [[The Good]] is true and obtains in all possible worlds, i.e. it's necessary.
*#* However, that is not the claim that all aspects of Being are necessary. For example, contingent truths may be possible. We are in no position to deny or confirm with certainty.
*# Only from that which is determined can one make determinations.
*#* Even probabilistic determination presents meaning, but they aren't as meaningful to us as those which have a 100% probability.


*# Reductive Physicalism is false.
*# Property Dualism is true.
*#* 
*# 

*# Physical existence monism
*#* 





*# Physical reality exists (it is a subset of Being).

* Think About It
*# Our minds are contained in physical brains.
*#* Well, we have the Brains in a Vat problem of The Matrix. We aren't forced by necessity. It is a possibility that is beyond us to know either way. What kind of position ought on hold? Pure agnosticism, I wager. That makes much of our view fundamentally agnostic all the way down then.
* Consciousness is epiphenomenal, and meaning might be as well (which is not to say it isn't real, but that the physical causes run in parallel to meaning intervening.

* Odd Things to Say:
*# Perfection exists.
