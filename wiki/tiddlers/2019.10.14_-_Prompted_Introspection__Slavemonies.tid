title: 2019.10.14 - Prompted Introspection: Slavemonies

!! If you received any sum of money as a gift, what would you do with it?

Okay, so out of thin air, these alien monies safely arrive on our planet via interstellar travel. This money, however, is far more functional than any normal kind of monetary value. You see, these monies are instantiated in living nearly omnipotent cash form agents who turn into, construct, or modify any material objects upon command. Once I've told the money what it do, itdo. MWAHAHAHA! So I don't feel bad, these slavemonies are not Daseinic, but they experience pleasure near the [[awe]] toward transcendence upon completion of their objective. I'd institute Heaven on Earth and have my slavemonies build outlandish penis structures in the world.
