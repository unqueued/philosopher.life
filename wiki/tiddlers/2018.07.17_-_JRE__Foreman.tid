title: 2018.07.17 - JRE: Foreman

My brother and I talked about the foreman apologizing to him. JRE played it so smoothly and well. I hope I can see that clearly. He is back with Carl. =(

He's now 99% convinced, it sounds, that it's over. This is really tough for me to hear, and it's not even happening to me. He feels himself drifting and disconnecting. Part of me says "GOOD!" It's heartbreaking. I don't even know if I should stop talking about it now because I do not want to add pain. I hope he will provide me guidance on how to be his best friend right now. I don't know what he needs from me.

He's possibly having a rough conversation about it with Rebecca tonight.

We talked some about the wiki. He was worried about offending me when he brought up two good points: The directory structure template and  the [[Root]] directory structure having the same name (and relative purpose), which is confusing, and I don't point enough to outside references and definitions. These are good worries. I will do my best to resolve these issues.

He told me to send the letter to Stephen Dougherty. I'm going to finish {[[Help]]} and do it. [[JRE]]'s right.
