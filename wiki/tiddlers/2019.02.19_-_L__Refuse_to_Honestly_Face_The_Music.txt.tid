How was your weekend?
MON 8:51 AM
Incredibly belated — it’s ironic that the days after I give you this crazy optimistic tirade are some of the worst work days I’ve had in a while, eh?
TUE 10:13 PM
=(
TUE 10:13 PM
I'm sorry.
TUE 10:13 PM
You surviving?
TUE 10:13 PM
Stupid long hours, and now that another one my coworkers has left we’re even more behind.
TUE 10:13 PM
Well, she didn’t just up and leave, she just got a new position somewhere else.
TUE 10:14 PM
It sounds like you are on a sinking ship.
TUE 10:15 PM
I am surviving yes. But I am determined not to let it wear me down like it did before.
TUE 10:15 PM
I hear ya. I am sorry that it is so incredibly draining.
TUE 10:15 PM
I’m actually in the process of updating my resume — even if being optimistic is insane it has at least given me the willpower to do what needs to be done.
TUE 10:17 PM
Preach.
TUE 10:18 PM
I refuse to fall back into the pit.
TUE 10:18 PM
I think even the pessimist should do that too, btw.
TUE 10:18 PM
I am sorry about the pit.
TUE 10:18 PM
You’re right. I’m just not as effective at working with my inner pessimist.
TUE 10:18 PM
It’s alright. Sometimes falling into the pit helps us find the motivation to move forward. Or maybe I am helplessly hopeful?
TUE 10:20 PM
I also realized that all this stress lately has cause me to lose weight, so I’m doing my best to track my calories and become a human vacuum cleaner.
TUE 10:20 PM
I will agree that anxiety and depression can be evolutionarily valuable and instrumental in some contexts.
TUE 10:20 PM
Lol. I want that exact problem with none of your others problems, please.
TUE 10:21 PM
XD
TUE 10:21 PM
It is something I wish I could give to others. I always have trouble talking to people about it because I know it’s basically the opposite struggle of most.
TUE 10:22 PM
It's flat out disgusting. =)
TUE 10:22 PM
Haha, exactly
