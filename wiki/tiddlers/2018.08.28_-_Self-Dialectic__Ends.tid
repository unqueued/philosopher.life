title: 2018.08.28 - Self-Dialectic: Ends

I do not see other people's perceptions of their ends and ultimately [[The Unmoved Telos]] as being accurate enough. I see my treating them as ends in themselves as requiring me to accept they are just wrong about what matters most, about how to live our lives, about who we are and should be. I radically disagree, and I should continue to radically disagree as kindly as I can; that is the best way for me to treat them as ends. I do have to accept that I see the truth better than they do and that I can never fully communicate it (they really aren't capable of seeing the picture I do), but I have to do my best to show them the way anyways. I have to do the same in my self-dialectic so obviously.

That sounds like sublation to me. Admittedly, there is input, blackbox function, and output. What is the sublator? It seems like the output, but that may not be fair.
