Huh. You know, I was an expert in this game. I should show my children this world because it will be a useful gateway to so many concepts. They can become masters of this game in record time and use this as an emotionally understood ludological narrative/framework to approach a very wide variety of concepts and disciplines.

# Play mirror matches and slowly expand the gauntlet.
# Talk about the game all the time.
# Have time where they construct decks and write about them!!!!!

Kids. Metagame preparation is 5/10ths of the game, and luck is the rest when you suck; metagame preparation is 9/10ths of the game (and luck the rest) when you don't. Metagame prep begets metagame prep. I want you to become virtuous at this practice to even understand what it means and what it's like to become an expert who is virtuous at a given practice. You must know the qualia of what it means to be virtuous in a particular way in order to snowball the empirical inferences and rule-of-thumbing necessary for becoming virtuous in general.

Play to win. What is winning in life? Win at answering that question too.

The first real deck in magic is the hardest to learn. It gets either easier or more beautiful from there.

Always be able to justify why a card is restricted or banned (or why it shouldn't be).

Be justifiably happy.

To the extrema of the relevance you can understand or capture, understand the salient relationship between these cards, rules, and players.
