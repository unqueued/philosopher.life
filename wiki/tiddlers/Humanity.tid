title: Humanity

Humanity is the ideal political agent who owns us because it morally-justifiably sublates us. Humanity as a collective agent emerging from [[The Original Position]] has the moral Hohfeldian rights molecule to its constituents. [[The Philosopher King]] must be a decentralized power that maps onto each of us fairly in the calculation. Yes, it is a simulated agent; yes, it is not free but bound by law unto us; yes, insofar as we are individually free, we contribute to the simulation of its freedom. [[The Right]] particularized to our state of affairs, to our [[fff]] context, is a method and heuristic, but it is not the ultimate answer. It is only ever means to dialectically reaching for the Real Platonic Ideal.

Idealism is only ever means to realism. Just because you or anyone (or everyone) thought it doesn't make it true, no matter how much you want to believe your experience is the only one that matters. Just because your personal point of view is not [[The Object]]ive [[Truth]] does not there isn't an external source of authority we seek. 

Note, of course, that internalist idealism is only instrumentally valuable and never intrinsically. Thought is one direct step away from that which is unconditionally worth thinking about. Clearly, internalism and idealism present us the necessary material to fulfill our function toward [[The Telos]]. 

Insofar as the means to an end are necessary means, they are constitutive of that end. Thus, to treat anything as means to that end, if it is conceptually necessary to that end, and intended from this duty, is not to treat that thing as //mere// means but as part of [[The End]] itself. Perhaps it is correct to say we are the last necessary means to [[The End]] in how we reason about each other in moral philosophy. We are instruments of [[The Good]] (and [[The Right]], and I'd argue [[The Beautiful]]), we are not the ultimate ends in ourselves (sorry internalists). Hate it all you want (Saint Aristotle certainly did): you will have the bite [[The Dialetheic]] bullet into [[infinigress]] somewhere down the line; the agency necessary for faith is your plight. 

In this case, [[The Good]] of [[Humanity]] exacts significant tolls on us. Moral agency exists to serve [[Others]] [[irwartfrr]]. That's a tall order, and it means that we do not own ourselves all the way down. Humanity's moral rights to its individuals can conceptually be translated as property rights. Indeed, you will immediately want to ask the question: "Why be moral?" somewhere down the line. Do not confabulate; say your reasons honestly, human. [[Humanity]] is this sublator and [[SO]] agency which must arise from morally valid Frankfurtian [beliefs and desires] about our individual [beliefs and desires]. [[Humanity]] is the justified collective agent which emerges from and is constituted by our decentralized principles [[irwartfrr]]; it is not the positivists purposely broken definition.

Our weighings of individual reason with [[Humanity]]'s must be done fairly. We must avoid utility monsters in how we shape ourselves. Extremism that isn't extremely right is wrong (from a climbing the mountain or selecting a Bob turtle of turtles all the way down, unfortunately, [[The Right]] is infinitely extremely right). I cannot answer how to progress correctly; I simply do not know enough (and never will). This is my best heuristic. You are free to offer something better; I would be delighted to have a better, more practical, higher probability option which is somehow ultimately a better means to our end.

Like students in classrooms who have a duty to the class to prepare for class (to extent that they can, and so forth), I morally expect (though I obviously do not predict) everyone to attempt to be good citizens, political animals, and to be moral to each other in a radical, sacrificial way.

We build Golem instead of Humanity.

Sometimes empathy requires sacrificing ourselves in sublation; that is what respecting the dignitity of the [[Reason]] of [[Humanity]] (or rather personhood) is like.

So I've learned the awful truth about who we really are as humans. It's time to move on. To accept this red pill and figure out what I need to do. It is the only practical option. Accepting and dealing with the red pill experience is my plight.
