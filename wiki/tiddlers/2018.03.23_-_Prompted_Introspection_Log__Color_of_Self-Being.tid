title: 2018.03.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: Color of Self-Being

!! If you could be a color what would it be? Why?

What kind of fucking question is this Samwise? Is this how you spend your time? Answering and asking inane questions? You make me hate both of us. What is the color of disappoinment? Probably a greenish, turd brown. Alright, that's what color I //am//. What is the color of heaven, pure eternal happiness (of course, stochastic, with tolerance breaks in the right way at the right time, and so on and so forth; I hear you Consequentialists)? Fuck if I know. If I knew, do I think I'd be talking to myself on this wiki? (Well, maybe. But, I wouldn't be pissed off about it. [Okay, fine, consequentialists, maybe I would, and how would I know? You know what, you are just as epistemically blind as I am on this problem.]) This question and this answer are a pile of shit, just like you Samwise.
