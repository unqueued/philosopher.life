Hyperreal. Very interesting how much emphasis is put on the ontology of stories themselves. The author is a philosopher, without a doubt.

<<<
The Theory of Narrative Causality
<<<

Brilliant. I wished we spent more time hearing about the ontology and epistemology of the world. It's far too brief. It's not fair.

Story about stories, reflections and mirrors. Does this book steal our soul, or is that just a superstition? 

Desiderata is a beautiful, desirable name. Names are chosen carefully in this book, but how much do they matter?

Lilith is hilarious. Beautiful psychopathy, and the mirror is the tool of narcissists. Ironically, they never truly see themselves.

<<<
Wisdom is one of the few things that looks bigger the further away it is.
<<<

They are straight up mean to Magrat.

<<<
We have a lot of experience of not having experience.
<<<

Lol. I love it.
Classic LoTR feel to it in the travels.

Nanny's made up foreign-language approach is hilarious. She does have language skill, but it presents oddly. This book is funny.

<<<
Have you brushed your tooth?
<<<

Lol. =) This is slapstick.

My wife should write fiction like this. /roll on tvtropes and just make a story with it.

<<<
Grey. One eye. The left one...
<<<

I love the absurd overspecificity. 

It's interesting how Granny is not a person of doubt. She does not doubt herself or find herself when she wakes up, she knows who is doing the looking. Foreshadowed hard.

<<<
Proper meals...with gravy!
<<<

I've got some gravy for these slaghags. =)

...Interesting that "affecting the laws of chance" is wicked. These are witches. Magrat is naive.

Witches are conscious of stories.

Kind too children if they've been washed... rofl. =)

Love Oggs gyrating bosoms. =)

I think this book's notion of Voodoo is fun.

I'm still not understanding the ontology of the "Disc World." I need help, please. 

<<<
I am the good one.
<<<

Everyone thinks they are good. Know Thyself.
<<<
Things have to come to an end. That's what happens when you turn the world into stories.
<<<

I like this meta showdown. Granny is a character who is very hard to pin down. She's fourth-wall-ish. Outside the stories, the free ones, but they never escape being stories themselves. We are all stories. =) This showdown is a deeper discussion with whimsical words. 

<<<
Somewhere between no and yes
<<<

What does it mean to find the real reflection? 

The book was funny, cute, and interesting. It's not my style, I think, but I'm glad I read it.
