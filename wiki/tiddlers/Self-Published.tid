title: Self-Published

Here you will find my self-published works.<<ref "1">> I suppose this would be my letter to the world, if I ahd one. I hope this is a home for those memeplexes of mine which are fit to be more generally injected into the minds of others through consent-based information exchanges.

I want to point out that I may not agree with what I've written, but that I think what I've written is still worth reading.

Currently, I don't feel anything I've written deserves the status of being published beyond just having this wiki (although, some are close), nor I do think this site is ready for non-family visitors. At the moment this is just a {[[Dream|Dreams]]}.
