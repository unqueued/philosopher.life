title: 2018.10.22 - Tagging Theory: Original Tag

It is unclear if one ought to tag the root of a tag with itself. It seems like I shouldn't. When does that actually do me any good? I know it is what it is, and when I got to automatically render, when should I want it showing up? I think it depends. 

Take [[/b/]]. Is [[/b/]] itself really [[/b/]]ish? Not exactly. It's far too [[Leet]] for that, and it's too planned as project for the contents of the directory to be called [[/b/]]. It is no accident that I have a place to write accidentals. The [[/b/]] tag is a predicate, but it does not predicate itself in a powerful way; forgive me, Plato. 

I should add that [[Aliases]] make this more complex. Sometimes, I just want a nickname for the tag and even the [[titletag]]. If's a nifty trick that the <<tag [[FTO]]>> tag takes me to the [[FTO]] aliased parent. Of course, I can't do "New Journal Tiddler Here" now, at least not the default. That requires me to create a custom button. Naming is fucking hard.
