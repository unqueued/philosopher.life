title: 2017.04.30 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.04.29 - Homeschooling Log]]
** I used this to create the first [[Homeschooling Log Template]]
* [[2017.04.29 - Link Log]]
** Inspired me to create [[Philosophipolitical Prescription: Videos]]
* [[2017.04.29 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Today's is very short. Yesterday's was fairly long. I can see that this log may generate //disincentive// to create "New" tiddlers. This is not what I was expecting, but I should have seen it coming. I'm not sure how best to combat this. Essentially, reviews/audits create a tax burden on innovation here (as le capitalists would say). Fight through it. The greater good is at stake.
* [[2017.04.29 - Diet Log]]
** I'm not forcing myself to any limit. But, c'mon bro, be honest with yourself. This is still lacking vegetables. It's got easy junk food, and it doesn't have enough of what you need.
