Ribbonfarm is a highly lauded internet rabbithole. As a rabbitholer and rabbitholemaker, a philosopher, I see it as my duty to analyze it.

Ribbonfarm can be intoxicating. I can see why it is a drug to its users; it is a powerful mutation of the Rand-Locke memeplex coursing through the The Great Human Conversation-Mindplex.

It's genius. Is it good or bad? Is it right or wrong? I don't know. But, it is a beautiful device. I know one when I see one. It is deeply redpilled, to the point of purpose-filled absurd self-delusion. And, yet, we must admit that we have no argument against it besides faith. 

Does this contradict the [[Axioms of h0p3]]? Cleverly, yes. It is a hermeneutic spiral away from the Axioms possibly, or it reduces the Axioms to absurdity. That is a potent meme.
