title: 2017.03.24 - Pipefitting Log

Today was short, as expected. We finished the 1" simulator project off today. I had left the tools out (carefully) because I didn't want to wait for the toolroom to be unlocked to finish it (the teacher, at this point, trusts me to unlock and lock everything [but, he can't give me a key], and to get and use whatever I want). It looked clean (well, the very top flange wasn't perfect to my liking, but it didn't bother anyone else, so I let it go). Lots of "very goods" were handed out. All the warm fuzzies be unto us. 

If we were being honest with ourselves, while the flanges fit and the pipes were level, I saw that the longest pipe (about 10 feet long) had actually bent slightly after the complete mount. It wasn't blatant and in your face, but it was there definitely there. If our teacher was paying more attention, he definitely would have said something about it. That means we made a mistake. I'll have to measure it later to try and figure out what I did wrong.

We were going to put up the bookstore project up, but apparently, the governor "claimed" he would be here with some legislators. There was a big to-do in the large conference auditorium/room today, next to the bookstore. We didn't want to bother them. We'll finish it Monday.

Instead of moving onto taking our test (the three of us wanted to study for it), the teacher had us move onto the 1.5" section of the simulator. This time, they didn't even try to draw. We talked about what we wanted it to look like, and what we felt would be easiest to mount. Now that the 1" section is already mounted, it will be harder to fit the following sections. I was clever to give us space to do it. The 1" was on the outside, and this 1.5" will be in the middle, and the 2" will be on the outside (towards the back). This will make it easy on us. As I said, it wasn't my ultimate vision, but trying to find the easiest and cleanest way to push the series of projects together is a different and still very interesting challenge. 

The teacher handed us a pre-made 3-1/16th" nipple. He said that he's never had to make nipples like this on the job, and his first time ever producing them was in the shop class itself. The 535 Ridgid threading machine has a nipple attachment (I've only used it once [this is sounding extraordinarily sexual, said the pipefitter]). He said it was a hint. I thought about what he meant by this since it was not obvious how it was going to be a huge "hint" to us. I figured out what it was though (it was roughly the gameplan I already had), and it was mainly to deal with a tighter spot we were in at the top of the simulator (but, I could have cut and threaded my way out of it even without a tiny nipple). 

Since he went through the trouble to give us this "hint," I felt it would hurt his feelings if I didn't use the nipple he gave us (his nipple was shorter than it needed to be, making construction harder and planning more elaborate). This meant that I didn't get to freehand the design. I needed to build around the nipple. That meant I had to add the takeouts to find the true length (kind of reverse engineer the process, and maybe that was his intent), and then find the rest of the TLs. It went smoothly enough. I'm paranoid about being off. A 1/16th there and another over there, etc. add up. The other guys did not take measuring seriously enough. I know they don't enjoy it, but I really don't want to waste my effort. 

I drew it, the teacher didn't complain about all the measurements I wanted this time. The guys realized I was right about it after pointing out how it helped us avoid some tedious work by hand (and give us more exact measurements). We measured. I'm still learning to do this well. I need more practice at it. This is all a very good experience. 

We did the math, and I'm glad I had Chris check it. I did the wrong takeout for one of the pipes (I should be more careful, and I hope this is the last time that I choose to not double-check my own math before having someone else check it). We cut the pipes (I think my teacher was disappointed that we couldn't find more scrap to use in it, but this project is very long). I worked on the scrap parts I could use, and I had to readjust my threads which went too deep. I asked the guys if they were checking the threads. They said they hadn't. 

After I finished my pieces, I checked theirs (I check all the components because I don't trust anyone). They fucked up all of their pipes. I couldn't even get a full rotation on some of the threads (it should be between 3 and 4). Nash didn't think it was a big deal, but we have been down this road. It is heartbreaking to put in all that labor just to have it not work and need to redo it all. Chris immediately understood how the pipes were just going to be way too long (despite the fact that they cut all of their pipes 1/8" short - why aren't they fucking measuring!?). 

So, I fixed the machine and showed them what I wanted. You can technically (although, I've never been told it is acceptable to do) rethread a threaded pipe a bit deeper (into the wall of the pipe deeper) and even a bit deeper into the length of the pipe if you need. The trick is to barely apply pressure to let the threads catch in the die. If you put pressure, you'll break threads (which sucks). Chris realized how it worked after I showed him and tested it. I'm glad he saw the reason in it. Nash didn't seem to give a shit =/. Chris sorted it while cataloged and organized our materials for Monday. 

We didn't take a test. We will on Monday. I want to study for it. I tried to explain to the guys that while the core book does have some boilerplate bullshit in it, I definitely want to deeply understand everything in our Pipefitter books. I take these books very seriously. I assume journeyman know this stuff inside and out.  At this point, I'd rather do one a week, since I don't want to merely pass tests: I want to understand the material. Plus, it doesn't help us to accelerate faster than our actual shop work. There are no time gains, and the bookwork and shop work do not track each other content-wise. 

Oh, I forgot, I texted AB&T. I'll get my next set of forms on Thursday. As long as school is paid for, I won't have problems, right? ;P

Also, I turned down a 1-week construction job (they weren't paying very well). I couldn't pass the drug test if I had to (unless they just let cannabliss fly). 

I stopped by the local union. He gave me some books to read. I learned about the size of our jurisdiction and that we, in fact, act as traveling union members to other unions around the country. Also, Knoxville's job will be huge. There is a chance I could work there, which would be sweet. He guaranteed me a spot again today. I think I was tiring his patience with all my questions. We talked about my concern that I wouldn't be able to receive the same amount of training here as I would in Chattanooga. The new facility they are building (forced by the UA) is designed to alleviate that exact worry. They are hunting for a building now (when I walked in, he was on the phone talking about it with his bosses).

He told me what MIG was for, which is, as I suspected, to just push tons of weld material really quickly. If it doesn't have to be pretty, perfect, and completely clean, MIG is the real deal. What could take 4 hours of painstaking work could be handled by some the MIG-like machines in an hour. He said he doesn't own his own welding tools. Whatever he needs he uses at in the giant union shop. I think that's interesting. He hinted that owning your own machine would be useful for odd jobs and working outside the union though.
