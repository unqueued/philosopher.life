title: 2019.06.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Discus

* Woke at 10
* Med
* Fireman Time!
* Coffeebliss
* Read+Write
* Wife and I played frisbee
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* We went out to Goodwill.
** A young man working in the store was perfectly awkward just like me. We encountered each other several times, talked about the morality of calculators, and joked even (that never fucking happens with me!). I handed him my online card (in person, lol). He said my son was extremely polite, gushed over it. 
** We bought a boatload. I found 7 shirts! That's insane.
** We found out later that our son didn't listen to us in sizing and selection, and this made for a very difficult evening. It is a lot of work trying to get him to recognize the futility of self-harm.
* Cheap burgers; my son had not eaten lunch.
* Salvation Army moved, and they were closed when we got there. I probably won't be going there again. This is the last time, I believe.
* Son had a meltdown. Obstinate to reason; it was a rough dialectic point by point.
* Kids and I played frisbee
** We paid less a buck a piece for two used disks. These are much harder to throw correctly, but they go much further. Hurt to catch wrong. 
* Everything seemed to smooth out, thankfully.
* Read+Write
* Watermelon and lentil soup.
* Read+Write
* Lots of [[Music: Exploration]] and so much work for the Marxist sections of [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. This may take quite a while. =)
* Sleep by 2:30
