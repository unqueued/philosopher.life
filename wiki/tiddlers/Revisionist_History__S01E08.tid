Whatever (if any) thread of genius I have is likely the experimental kind. It definitely isn't what we normally think of as genius. Rather, we associate it with persistence and perfectionism.

The whole coincidence pseudo-spiritual component of the narrative he tells is lipstick and rouge. I can't help but wonder if all listeners (me included ayy) are meant to see themselves as an experimental genius (since they would know if they were the conceptual kind.)

Not the best episode. That's okay. It didn't make me angry.
