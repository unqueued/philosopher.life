title: 2019.08.09 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Infopower

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Knowledge is power. Information is power. The secreting or hoarding of knowledge or information may be an act of tyranny camouflaged as humility.
<<<

Knowledge is a cluster of powers which vary with the circumstance. It is possible to know that which can only be reasoned about into ideality with no other effects in the material world beyond the opportunity cost and energy expenditure (for we [[fff]]). 

Information, on my definition of [[power]], has dialectical power. Corresponding representation is one of the hard problems in philosophy, and I cannot answer this all the way down. Anything which exists, including representative information, has an essential being in at least ideality. The structures are [[infinite|The Infinite]], so I have no idea how to safely reason about it. However, I don't think this is what the quote intends, as evidenced in the conclusion.

Artificial information advantages are often incredibly immoral. I am radically opposed to intellectual property and dishonesty, including omission, which cannot be morally justified to an extreme degree. Those with significant political power rarely deserve this abusable privilege.
