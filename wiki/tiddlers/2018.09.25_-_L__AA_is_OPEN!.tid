How goes it? (It's late, so ignore me at will, please)
Mon 10:47 PM
 It goes!

 Saw my parents this weekend — mom said she’s read through your letter and is slowly working on her own response.
15 hours ago
 I told her it would mean a lot to you if she did actually send it out, so here’s to hoping she does. \o/
15 hours ago
 I’m not totally sure Chase’s situation was handled all that well this weekend. He has something he needs to do to get his financial aid reinstated and the family was heckling him about it. Really upset him.
15 hours ago
 I am reaching out as neutral party in hopes that he will feel less attacked, because if anything he just needs to know we’re on his side.
15 hours ago
 You travel often on your weekends.
11 hours ago
 I'm glad she read it. I'm glad she is developing a response!
11 hours ago
 Was her mood about it angry? sad? disturbed? unsure? Clearly, to be writing at all means it must matter to her.
11 hours ago
 I'm sorry to hear about Chase.
11 hours ago
 I kind of don't see you as a neutral party. It seems like you think his mom is abusive, and you are trying to help him be constructive in a bad situation.
11 hours ago
 Were you able to determine if his life is at risk?
11 hours ago
 I know I’m not truly a neutral party. Maybe that was the wrong phrasing to use.
10 hours ago
 I’m trying to extend the kindness you, [[JRE]], and [[AIR]] extend to me by letting him know that family secrets are bullshit and I’m in his corner.
10 hours ago
 lol
10 hours ago
 I hear that.
10 hours ago
 Did he hear you?
10 hours ago
 I don’t believe his life is in trouble.... but I can’t rightfully say. [[K]] is still being lied to, and I’m not exactly that close to him to know if his response is honest.
10 hours ago
 He did respond immediately to what sent him though.
10 hours ago
 I can only hope my true intentions reach him.
10 hours ago
 Ah. That makes sense. I suppose [[K]] is the interpreter.
10 hours ago
 What I* sent him
10 hours ago
 I’m trying to give him the opportunity to respond to me individually instead of through [[K]], if possible... I find that tends to make people more willing to converse.
10 hours ago
 I will keep trying though. It’s only fair that I do so for his sake.
10 hours ago
 As I’d want someone to do the same for me.
10 hours ago
 Aye. I hope he takes your hand.
10 hours ago
 As for my mother’s response, she seemed largely confused. I think much of your letter was filled with so much philosophical jargon that she found it difficult to read.
10 hours ago
 I think I’ve talked to you enough I can personally translate it (or have the wherewithal to look it up quickly) but ya know
10 hours ago
 She is carefully wording a response though, which means she is thinking about it. I think she was surprised to hear I read what you sent her. XD
10 hours ago
 Yes. You do understand me well.
10 hours ago
 Does she understand that I write in the open?
10 hours ago
 I'm really glad she is writing a response!
10 hours ago
 I think she does now, yes. But she wasn’t hostile when she discussed it with me. She was happy to hear from you and said something positive about ketamine (I guess you mentioned it somewhere and I didn’t realize?).
10 hours ago
 Or maybe she made a connection somehow idk.
10 hours ago
 Fascinating.
10 hours ago
 OH
10 hours ago
 Something else I just remembered — she seemed to think your response about drug use was a very different story than what she heard from [[MWF]] & [[SLT]]
10 hours ago
 To which I was like “oh yeah, weird huh?” -cough cough-
10 hours ago
 rofl
10 hours ago
 She must be reading and digging!
10 hours ago
 She wasn’t negative about that either. Seemed thought provoking to her at the very least.
10 hours ago
 Sometimes my mother’s responses surprise me. But then again, she and I think very similarly, so perhaps I just don’t give her enough credit.
10 hours ago
 I didn't mention drug use or ketamine, from what I can see. I don't even see how she got there other than actually trying to see my point of view at large. My hope-meter has risen!
10 hours ago
 \o/
10 hours ago
 I may prod her a bit more about it next time I see her just to see what all she’s read.
10 hours ago
 Shower time — brb
10 hours ago
 (Keep talking tho)
10 hours ago
 I take the work on the JASG book to be separate from the letter itself (though, I clearly link to it, and it's one of the demonstrations that I'm thinking about her and what she gave us). That has lots of philosophical work in it. I can see her being confused about that. It's especially she is not confused by the letter itself. I'm often not as clear as I need to be.
10 hours ago
 I did say things in the JASG commentary she could "look up" though. I will be interested to see how she thinks about it.
10 hours ago
 I can't actually recall ever seeing your mother's writing (not any significant amount). To hear her voice in her writing will be a new opportunity for me.
10 hours ago
 I'm overjoyed to hear she wasn't feeling hostile about it in her discussion with you and was happy to hear from me.
10 hours ago
 It makes me feel sick to my stomach to consider (and even predict) "this is it." I am glad to be shown my prediction is wrong.
10 hours ago
 Your mother clearly has significant experience with depression. I think it's awesome that she would have something positive to say about ketamine. I suspect her chemistry prowess plays a non-trivial role here. My use of ketamine is still something most doctors consider experimental (and when I bought it years ago, it wasn't actually hard to find anyone talking about it at all). I am pleased to see she might not think I'm just some drug-addict, but that I've been forced to take matters into my own hands to find a medicine.
10 hours ago
 I am glad to hear that she is open to the possibility that ?[[MWF]]? and [[SLT]] have been dishonest on this front.
10 hours ago
 was actually hard*
10 hours ago
 I may also be getting the letter and the book’s response confused in my head — I tend to do that
9 hours ago
 But I think she is just as capable of learning your “language” as I am, it will just take time
9 hours ago
 Agreed!
9 hours ago
 I generally think her view of you is not the real picture anymore... she still seems to view you as the child you once were. But she does the same to me, and I think this discussion will provide the opportunity for you to change the outlook she has.
9 hours ago
 She has gotten better about not treating me like a child lately. It’s taken time but she is there.
9 hours ago
 Lol
9 hours ago
 I don't know how to say it, but sometimes when I look at you, I see the razorwit 4 year old girl I got to know as a teenager. I truly that's she's not you (all growed up and stuff), but she jumps out at me like a ghost!
9 hours ago
 truly know*
9 hours ago
 jesus, my engrish is bad
9 hours ago
 Same — we all have our days
9 hours ago
 Funny thing is I often don’t notice your mistakes till you fix them. >_>
9 hours ago
 That is some Bayesian reasoning right there. You probabilistically read me.
9 hours ago
 Hehehe. I call it “learning your language”. It can be super handy at times but also frustrating when “translations” are shortcoming or full of misconceptions. 

Also, I do think it’s hard not to fall back on our depictions of family we knew from times past... I still find myself doing the same with my sister.
9 hours ago
 It took me all weekend to finally have a good, thorough conversation about school.
9 hours ago
 They are all models we must update and grow.
9 hours ago
 with your sister?
9 hours ago
 I think the persona she puts on in front of my parents at home is not her true persona. At least not that I’m seeing.
9 hours ago
 Yes, with [[AG]].
9 hours ago
 She frontin', yo.
9 hours ago
 Which is understandable — I did the very same.
9 hours ago
 I cannot say I'm any better in this respect, lol.
9 hours ago
 It can be a survival mechanism in some cases.
9 hours ago
 How [[AG]] doing?
9 hours ago
 It took me several years in college to figure out and untangle this front. I think that’s why I was so mad at them for awhile. >_>
9 hours ago
 She’s doing well, it seems. She has definitely adopted my mother’s “I’m going to be in your business whether you want me to or not”.
9 hours ago
 lol
9 hours ago
 Does she get to be herself with you? Or, do you have to pry her open?
9 hours ago
 It’s a painful reminder of who I was raised to be. She mentioned that the people she was scolding were giving her the cold shoulder and I tried to explain why. I’m trying to open her perspective on this a little.
9 hours ago
 I have to get her not in front of the parents, but otherwise her opening up is fairly easy.
9 hours ago
 She seems very willing to want to talk to me, which is really nice.
9 hours ago
 I'm glad she's willing to talk with you. I'm not sure how much her communications are monitored, but hopefully she'll use her device(s) to stay in touch with you too. That might be "less in front," I do not know.
9 hours ago
 When we’re around the parents she’s in “baby” mode and I find it very irritating.
9 hours ago
 lol
9 hours ago
 Oh, VERY monitored I’d imagine.
9 hours ago
 My mother used to read my Facebook messages.
9 hours ago
 wow
9 hours ago
 I hated it.
9 hours ago
 An invasion of privacy and no trust. It’s part of why I rejected her so strongly when I hit college. I could finally breathe and never wanted to go back.
9 hours ago
 I want [[AG]] to have the same.
9 hours ago
 Any freedoms I did have were over WoW because chat history isn’t logged (at least not that I was aware of)
9 hours ago
 But I don’t think [[AG]] has any of those.
9 hours ago
 not unless you turned it on or someone keylogged you
9 hours ago
 Right.
9 hours ago
 (the company, of course, kept all records)
9 hours ago
 Of course.
9 hours ago
 I more meant my mother, specifically.
9 hours ago
 makes sense
9 hours ago
 I take it she needs that outlet.
9 hours ago
 I believe so, yes. An outlet to discover herself.
9 hours ago
 I don’t want her to be a mini-me or mini-mom. I want her to be [[AG]].
9 hours ago
 lol
9 hours ago
 online gaming is a non-trivial way to explore who we are; I wonder what her "WoW" could be.
9 hours ago
 I miss Vanilla wow.
9 hours ago
 SAME
9 hours ago
 And I’m not sure...
9 hours ago
 They have Vanilla WoW servers up, actually.
9 hours ago
 the sign of a dying game
9 hours ago
 slowly milking everyone for everything they are worth until the last drop
9 hours ago
 EQ had progression servers
9 hours ago
 Oh definitely.
9 hours ago
 People aren’t very happy with the latest expansion either.
