title: 2019.04.25 - Afterschool Teaching: 1-on-1's

Whitney had a migraine today. She was extra grumpy, understandably. I tried to lighten the load, but she was having none of it. Alright. 

I asked 5CM if he had a computer at home for my brother [[JRE]] (who has offered to pay for one for him). He has a tablet, but no internet. He also had a phone, but wasn't even sure if he had internet access. I had him pull it out of his trapperkeeper, and I showed him how to pull up the browser and use it. I guess he's not interested in technology so much (not yet!). I need to encourage him here. The ESL instructor came by while I was talking to put on a show (I watch her otherwise and know she does not do this normally). She was signaling to both of us how proud she was of him doing his work. Uh, huh, yeah, mmhmm, kthxbai. After testing and tutoring, you said the kid couldn't read. That is obviously not true (though he clearly struggles); your evaluation is not to be trusted.

The janitors and I talked about kids and screen time. They said it was a double-edged sword, and they didn't know what to do about it. Wise words, old men. 

Also, unlike the trend, we spiked up a bit today. Almost the entire 5th-grade roster came today. I took those who had homework, and then Sonya came, and Whitney brought everyone to the library. I was surprised by the number of 6th graders with homework.

I pacified and encouraged socializing. I brought out a bunch of board games. 5NP lied about Whitney asking for me, and that lie had to be punished. I'm still astounded by the normalization of deception all around me. I actually pissed a bunch of students off today, so I must be doing something right.

I had 1-on-1's with many. 7Jm2 was being violent and threatening. When I call my children down, everyone knows they are in trouble. He was unconnectable, but I explained the rules of respect and his duty. He cleaned for me too. 

7Jm and 6CM are also too violent. We had a good talk. I continue to speak to them about their substance use. I asked 6CM about the scars on her arm, and we talked about her cutting. We discussed empathy and what it means to identify with and love our persistent identity. 

8Af told me, "when you grow up, Mr. [[h0p3]], you're gonna be a hippie." ROFL. Such high praise. When does this growing up thing happen? I'm so not ready.

The kids freestyled for quite a while. My namesake struggled, and I encouraged her to listen and not be offended. 

5KB and I talked. She keeps bothering her sister. She's sad that her sister doesn't want anything to do with her. She said the 5th graders are retarded. I roared laughing. They are retarded assholes with some exceptions. We talked about hanging out with some of the older girls like 7HM and 8Gf (whom I consider to be solid rolemodels). I walked her through the kids in front us, and then we talked books (it is unfortunate that I am the one who must speak about humans and books; I'm often ridiculously illiterate...but, I'm all she has here).

7Jm started throwing his phone on the floor. After making sure it was his, and after explaining he's not allowed to endanger anyone or damage the library, I allowed him to continue. It's his phone to break (fool...though it is an iPhone, so that made me smile [ofc, I hate all phones]). We listened to music on mine. They like some of my choices, so I'm super cool and stuff.

The library was an exceptional wreck, but it is my honor to clean it. It is almost hallowed ground to me.

Delp had me do some Matt clerical work. He also recommends my daughter learn to golf because of Title 9. That is not a terrible idea. He obviously has mixed feelings about the fact that I homeschool and have such strong opinions about education. We talked about the centralization of power, and he wanted to rant about "participation" and Millenial snowflakes. I gingerly handed his ass to him, he conceded, and we moved on.

I got to leave 15 whole minutes early. Noice.
