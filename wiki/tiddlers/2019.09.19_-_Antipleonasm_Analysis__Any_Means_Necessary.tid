title: 2019.09.19 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Any Means Necessary

We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary.

Perhaps you want it, but it ought not be by any means necessary. Instrumental reasoning is merely hypothetically normative. You must give me an unconditional [[end]], and only then will the logically necessary means to a normatively necessary end become normatively necessary as well. I get the gist, but it's a dangerous line to draw so ambiguously. It's a veiled threat of something immoral which I can't abide by. All of this said, I agree that violence is going to be necessary to defeat psychopaths who have herded and cultivated their human capital farm animals like vampires.
