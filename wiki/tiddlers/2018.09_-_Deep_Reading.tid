!! Audit:

* I came out of the gates swinging this month.
* My tablet died and with it my graphic digital reading on the throne. 
* I've been reading tiny little things my wife gave me. They aren't boring, though I probably don't have much to say about them.
* I kind of want to go through my boyhood books again. It's been a very long time. I want to see them with old and fresh eyes.
* There is a huge fucking gap here, and it's clear writing in [[FTO]] has taken me away from [[Deep Reading]]. That's fine. I should sacrifice my reading time to speak with others.
* There's a fuckton of trash this month. 
* I can barely bring myself to read anything actually serious anymore. What happened to me? I've always been lazy as fuck, but this is insane. I'm failing to get myself to work on what matters most, to read the hard stuff, etc.
* [[The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self]] is taking forever.
** Autocompletion worked nicely for this one. I know I could have searched it up. 
* I didn't log my reading of [[The Cay]], even though I read it over a couple days. Is that a mistake? It doesn't feel like one to me!
** I wouldn't want to do that with most of my books.
* I've been struggling with whether or not I should be making multiple tiddlers for small books. I've decided to continue the practice because I want to make it simple to differentiate multiple readings in the primary link. Perhaps this is a mistake, but that's okay. I can always come back and fix it, right?
** I think it also makes it easy to handle my logs in the end. No sifting or guesswork. I could just plain date and then add the link after "--" lol...
* I need to finish HP and LOTR
* I want to keep reading more children's literature. It should be part of my mix.
* I should bang out my wife's remaining books.
** And, yes, I mean that euphemistically too! =)
* Aside: we've gone through our physical library and done a damned fine job weeding. I'm so proud of my wife.
