title: 2019.02.22 - Self-Dialectic: Doorways

Walkthrough through doorways, we forget where we were and what we're thinking. Does the same occur between tiddlers? How about Bob tabs?

The phenomenology of using and wielding the wiki is something I've just not paid enough attention to. I'm not even sure how to test or reason about it effectively. What about it works so well in this respect? When does it fail me here? [[Tagging Theory]], the [[APFVD]] structure, and other [[Wiki Mechanics]] allow me to be fluent, to hold in memory what I normally couldn't, to lower friction, etc. It has narrowness when I need it, and it has openness to make as many doorways as I need otherwise. I'm awful at describing this.
