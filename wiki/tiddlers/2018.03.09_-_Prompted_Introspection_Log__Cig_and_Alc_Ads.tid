!! What effects do cigarette and alcohol advertising have on young people?

As I have pointed out many times on this wiki, I consider advertisement to be a form of mind-control. No, you dumb fuck, not some radical surgery, not some highly coordinate cabal that tweaks you into the exact robot slave they desire, not some magic telepathic powers, etc. It's not complete control, although if they could get that, they would. The influence is obvious. It's a huge industry for a reason. 

We aren't in any standard dialectic regarding advertising. Marketing is rapacious subversion of autonomy; it is just an expression of their psychopathic will to power. The goal is to manipulate you, not to enlighten or help you. The same is true of any sort of propaganda. I take advertisements to be a form of warfare against the people. Now, you might be retarded enough, Samwise, to believe I'm exaggerating. That's because you've been effectively conditioned; you have Stockholm Syndrome developed from assenting to the Randian Memeplex spreading like ebola through the world. Yes, you delusional fucktard, this is an attack on our basic autonomy. Call it what it is, and then you try to argue for it. Don't lie though, especially not to yourself.

Advertising works on all people, including the young. It's despicable. Cigarettes and alcohol rely upon it. They rely upon hooking people and maintaining their grip on others as long as possible. It's why you see them target the poor quite a bit, but it's also why you see it more and more in third-world sections. They have Cigarette schools in China which are funded daycare centers that teach them to smoke. That's fucked up, yo. That, by the way, is still a form of advertisement.

Life passes like a kidney stone when I'm talking to you Samwise.
