title: 2006.12.27 - The Christmas Summary

I enjoyed our Christmas. It was odd in that the house has been relatively empty. But, we made the best of it. We had AA’s family over on Christmas Eve. It took at least two days to whip the house into shape and get all of the cooking done (thank you k0sh3k). We did a great job. Of course, we didn’t put up the mandatory Christmas tree (but I’ve already stated my opinion of this), but I don’t care what others think about the issue…Cleaning out of the garage was probably the hardest task (but, yay! it is done…I can breathe freely now).

j3d1h got a bunch of presents (books, toys, clothes, etc). k0sh3k got some charms, a head orgasmatron massager (way cool, I thought it was retarded until I tried it…everyone loves it), some lottery tickets as an inside joke (although I didn’t buy them, I won them in a white elephant party), and a “Ryrie” (sp?) study Bible, and I got this website…Jim wouldn’t budge, and remained quite silent about whatever he wanted; he is getting cash (because I simply won’t buy something for a person unless I know they will want/need it…and I’m sure a college student could use some cash).

Work blows, as usual. I love working, I can be very productive. I like tasks. But, I don’t like being undervalued. I do a normal person’s day of work in a couple hours, what incentive do I to do any more? Too much pressure and stress in this workplace concerning “their careers” in general…as if what we do is ’so’ important. Lol. Not that I don’t think everyone has a place, but be honest. If everyone was doing the right thing, we’d be praising, worshiping, and studying God and His Will. If 6 billion people started doing that right now, I guarentee you that God would provide for us….isn’t that definitional of heaven in some respects? We give up our freedom and will to God, and He will regain His dominion over us in the fullest sense (as He gave up His right to us in the act of giving us freedom), and in return, through His dominion, God will be a steward, half master and half caretaker, of His creations. So, yeah, I think we all might be sinning by doing anything other than thinking about and worshipping God….

Back on topic…lol.

I was glad to have the family (that remains in the states) over for dinner (including Allen). We had a good time. We even got to test the Nintendo Wii out. 250$ on that…not bad. Although, I think the people who own it could have used/spent that money more wisely /shrug, but hey, I’m not out of debt completely either (we have the money to pay off the full debt though, but we are still creating that financial buffer).

We got pictures taken, took 2 full hours of waiting (and we had been scheduled). They are pretty good ones too.

As good as Christmas was, Advent sucked. Our Sunday school class is…old. They are bad at it though. I’d expect they would be wiser. Why am I surprised? Even these people are just don’t get it. I see two major trains of thought in these older folks: 1.) The pragmatist. This person believes in all that is practical and concrete. And, I do appreciate this approach. In fact, used correctly, you can arrive at truth. These are the depression era types, and we fully understand the protective and conservative views and behaviors of these people. The problem is that they can come to practice pragmatism at the sacrifice of the true aims of being practical: successful and wise thinking. In the end, and I hate to say it, so-called pragmatists, are often lazy thinkers. Everything in moderation people. 2.) The relativist. We goto a church that is a bit more high steeple than I’m used to. These are older and somewhat more well-off people than usual. They are also more educated (or conditioned if you will). This means that I run into the post-modern and relativist reply on every Sunday…even from our usual teacher (although k0sh3k does teach, and I enjoy those Sunday’s more). It is so unfortunate that we don’t have more people with pragmatist values who can effectively wrestle and argue with the relativists. Generally good, but often stupid people. Do I look down on this? Hell yes. I hope I don’t end up like that…not that i’m not already a bitter old man by 21.

Bah, I simplify too much…it is sad that I can’t get even a quarter of my thoughts, or most any real detail…I am lazy and incompetent in this respect.

As to all things WoW: I’ve recently botted my new rogue to 60 (hit 60 on X-mas Eve). Took me 4 weeks because of patches and lots of issues, or 9.5 days played in game (which puts me as the fastest botter on WoWglider I believe). Now I am grinding up to High Warlord gear (easy enough). Took us a weekend to get ONE piece. That is simply amazing, considering the original r14 HWL gear took 6 months at around 18-20 hours a day of grinding…I can do it in 20-30 hours, stretched over time, for a single piece. 1-2 weeks at the old r14 pace would give you the full set and then some. I dearly want to bot the BG’s, but I suspect high detection rates. For now, I’ll lay low..after all I really only need the weapons which simply won’t be matched anywhere else until 70. TBC is out on the 16th. So, I’ll be fully prepared I think…with the exception of my lost playing skill. 2 months of not playing has brought me down to a mediocre level. I still win, but I’m not unbeatable in a duel (in part because I haven’t broken a gear level threshold to maintain a consistent threat, even full-CD, against top opponents).

For MTG: Playing High Tide/Reset, “Solidarity,” and I’m having fun with it. It is a responsive deck entirely. It can win as an instant, and really breaks the rules of the game in some ways. My version is of course against the B/R list, but who cares…it is much more consistent. It has excellent games against most any deck (exluding the necro deck which can own the game turn 1..uhh…Mox, land, rit, necro, Duress, GG).

All in all– Good Christmas.
