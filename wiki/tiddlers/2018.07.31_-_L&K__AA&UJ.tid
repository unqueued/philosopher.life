Also, I am considering sending an e-mail to your mother and father; I want to say thank you for the gifts, but I also want to introduce them to my wiki. I want them to get to know me, since I really don't think they do. Is that a bad idea?

 My worry is that it's not worth my time or would even just be damaging to reveal it.
3 hours ago
 No, I don’t think it’s a bad idea.

 Cool. Do you have advice?

 Sorry for the terrible response time. I have a big D&D game on my mind and it’s been taking up most of my time today. 

Hmmm... other than what you likely already know that (1) they might not read it and (2) they may not answer any questions you have in a way you like.

 Read your wiki I mean.
13 minutes ago
 No, it's np. In fact, I'm with you taking a while to consider how to answer the question.

 How people react to my wiki is exactly what I hold them accountable for, to be clear. Do you understand the implications here?

 This is a T42T (Tit for Two Tats) test.

 {Contact} and Find The Others are worth your exploration.

 Just in case

 I will be completely honest with you and say that, from what I’ve heard, they view you similarly to how your parents do.
9 minutes ago
 Yes. I suspect so.
9 minutes ago
 A lot of their opinion of you right now is informed by them.
9 minutes ago
 This is why I wish to give them a chance.
9 minutes ago
 I will pay laser-like attention to them.
9 minutes ago
 This is why you have a say in this.
8 minutes ago
 You must help me navigate it wisely and kindly. Perhaps it is kindest to say nothing at all.

 I also do not wish to make your life any more difficult. I'm not here to have relationship triangles (which are unstable).
8 minutes ago
 This is a choice that may affect both of us and our relationship with each other.

 You are a stakeholder and shareholder in my identity.

 Hmmmmm
4 minutes ago
 I think I should give you a chance to think about it for a while.
4 minutes ago
 Is that okay?
4 minutes ago
 I am asking for your informed consent.
4 minutes ago
 Yeah, of course!
4 minutes ago
 I really appreciate that.

 I think I’ll talk it over with my other half to make sure I’m not misrepresenting them in my brain while I think about it.
3 minutes ago
 I really appreciate your willingness to empathize with me here. I will do my best to respect your  reason as much as my own.
3 minutes ago
 My gut reaction has no problem with it honestly
3 minutes ago
 I’m curious to know how they will respond. But I will still definitely think about it.
2 minutes ago
 Your other half is openly part of this conversation. I bunch you two together as a single person very often.
1 minute ago
 I feel like gut reactions are important to consider. Maybe I’m just strange.
1 minute ago
 No, they are certainly part of the enterprise of good reasoning.
1 minute ago
 Cool.
