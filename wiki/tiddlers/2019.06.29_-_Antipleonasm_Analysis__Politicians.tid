!! Respond to the following gem:

Political questions are far too serious to be left to the politicians.

It is our moral obligation to participate in politics. We are political animals by telos; thinking, especially with, about, and for [[others]] is our essence and purpose, but some people are much better at being [[good]] persons (and humans) than others. It is clear, that that political [[power]] must always reside with the people, including how we compress our identities in votes, construct accurate representational infrastructures, and empower trustworthy representatives.

Those who think they are above the fray, beyond politics, apolitical, or don't feel like participating in political discourse are immoral. I am not confident we will defeat the market of politics.
