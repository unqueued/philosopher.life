* [[2019.07.08 - Wiki Review: Pardon]]
** Fascinating to see //Stranger Things// talk about capitalism and communism. It paid lipservice, but it does not take a side clearly enough. I am suspicious.

** Bust. Killed it. Done. I have enough for now, I guess.
** I did get a lot of cleaning done though.

** Nailed it. I could elaborate, but my linking does it for me. I am glad to be afforded the opportunity to be lazy.
* [[2019.07.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Deconstructed Burgers]]
** Completed. Looking so bland and wonderful.
*** I have been productive, but nothing pops up in here. Lol!

** I have heard nothing but through their mother; they said they were exhausted. I'm sad to see they haven't even attempted to say anything, but that's up to them.

** Ugh was right. Looks fixed now. So annoyed. I'm wondering if the scripts I used create some kind of race condition in Bob.
