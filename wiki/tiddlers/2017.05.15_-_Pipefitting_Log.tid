title: 2017.05.15 - Pipefitting Log

Today wasn't as productive as I'd have liked, but it was good. I overstudied for my exam on excavation. The past few tests, which are directly about pipe construction, were difficult. They required a lot of attention to detail. This one almost disappointed me with the simplicity of the questions. It is better to be overprepared than under though. I will continue to ultimately aim for the golden mean, even if that requires I slightly overshoot to the side of excess.

I literally spent all day studying, except right after lunch (before the break). I talked with the guys about a very wide variety of topics. They continually picked my brain about my children, what I wanted for them, education, New Orleans, computer hardware, hacking, anonymity, research chemicals, etc. 

In any case, I crushed the exam (I found out I did well on the previous as well). I then moved onto the 4-on-6 Chris and I started last Thursday. Chris didn't get much done in an hour and a half last Thursday, and I didn't have but 15 minutes to do anything with it. I deburred it and smoothed it out. It still has a wobble and gap, but it is closer. My teacher told me to tack it and mark it. I'm not convinced that is going to help though. I'm all ears, but remembering my marks isn't the hard part. Knowing //where// to mark in the first place is the hard part on this piece. Hopefully, we'll fix it tomorrow. Chris was out on some guilt-trip trip (not sure if I should be redundant here) today. 

The teacher says we won't be able to buy the hardware to mount the simulator until after July 1st, the beginning of the school's fiscal year. I talked about where we should store it. OSHA makes it a bit difficult for us. We'll probably take down the simulator fabrications on the old one, clean it up, and then forklift the new one over. We have to tie it down with some serious rigging too. That's the plan at least.

After talking about the simulator, he showed me something he's working on for the city. It's a park bench. We're taking it apart, fixing it, and welding it back together. He has assigned that to me for tomorrow. I'm excited. I hope I can figure it out. I have no idea what my teacher is getting out of it, but I don't care. This is practice. I'm grateful to have it.

My teacher also told me that we'll be spending Wednesday through Friday on the Torque seminar. I have read about it, and I have a special packet on it I've covered. I've yet to actually use it. I'm going to try and take exceptional notes. I hope to get my hands dirty too (although I have my doubts we'll get the chance). I want to really understand it deeply. Our teacher for this topic is apparently an expert, although the teacher hates the man. I've heard our torque teacher is not a punctually reliable man from more than one person.

Also, my teacher has a Memorial Day vacation swap he decided to force on us. We'll be out of class for an extended period of time, a whole week extra for my teacher. We will "make it up" in July's break (unenforced attendance). I think this sucks. I want to fucking learn. This is ridiculous. I'm going to ask the welding teacher if I can come in and learn from him and his students during that time period. There is no reason to waste this opportunity.

On a different note, my teacher thought it was stupid that 7th graders were touring the school. His reasoning was "Why would they think about their occupation at that age?" To him, it was as if planning for the future and teaching them to plan was not worth doing. Even if it isn't successful for all, the attempt is obviously necessary. He has the wrong mentality.

After class, I visited the union. I talked to Randy. I made a mistake. I brought 2 of 3 the books that I meant to give back. Upon inspection, I found the 3rd book in my backpack wasn't the right one. Fuck. I didn't have time to run all the way back home for it. I thanked Randy and explained a couple of points about the books that I found interesting. We talked about the fact that a lot of people in our area hate unions, allergically so, and that it's hard to find workers and work in our area. He is trying to find a way for apprentices to train locally though. I think this is because the higher-ups don't like how he does it. I talked about how school was going. He told me they still intend to hire in August, and that even if they weren't, he is going to fight to hire me and T.J. anyways. I told him about Chris. Anyways, I'm bringing the book by tomorrow; he won't be there, but he said someone would. He needs the book for the classes he is required to take. I'm going to put a "thank you" note in it with my name to make sure he remembers it.

Lastly, I want to note that I am kind of in awe of my brother [[JRE]]. I talk to him on the phone, and talking to him in person makes it even clearer.  His pipebending is beautiful, and he understands screwpipe (and something else that electricians do which pipefitters, who work with pressure, do not). I have no idea how he learned all this without going to school for it. I hope that I'll be able to do on-the-job training as well as he has.
