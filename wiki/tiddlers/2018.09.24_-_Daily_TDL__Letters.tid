title: 2018.09.24 - Daily TDL: Letters

* Finish letters
* Post piano
* Read+Write
* Porkchops, Asparagus, Potatoes, and something. 
** Unfortunately, the watermelon is all gone. The season's gift is done for. =( I am grateful to have had so much watermelon this year. It's got to be one of my favorite foods, and it only increases each year (and I've always loved it!).
* Encourage chillun
* Finish links? Ha.
