My wife saw my posts about it. She decided to fill me in on what happens. I'm not insanely surprised, but I'm intigued enough I want to hear the last section. I can't believe I'm saying that. This is Stephenson's problem, and it's obvious he's trying to do something about it now.

I'm jumped straight to part 3 now.

It's as my wife explained. The story isn't very motivating to me. As I said before, I wish I had a brief summary/abstract of the premise, plot, notions, etc. It's interesting, but as usual with Stephenson, the concept and worldbuilding is simply more interesting than the story.
