title: 2019.01.07 - Prompted Introspection: Muh Medium

!! What medium would your life best be shown as? A movie? A television series? A cartoon? What genre would a movie about your life fall under? Comedy? Romance?

This is a fantastic question. I've attempted to answer it here: [[2017.11.26 - Prompted Introspection Log: Life as Medium+Genre]]. I have another kind of answer I'd like to give this time around.

//As a Rawlsian Marxist//, I'm convinced the material realm is a moral medium in which I'm engaged in a dialectic with [[Humanity]] to fulfill [[The Moral Law]]. I also think my internal representation of that external medium is the best way to "show" myself the world and who I am. I have no idea how to answer the rest of your questions, and I barely have enough substance here to flesh it out any further.
