Planning out runewords. 

Took Clone down, and the charm was awful. I'll just collect them. =)

I also drunkenly, last night, reset my maps on the sorc, clicking on nightmare. That's okay. I found a new way route on my first try that is better. It's quite fast. I'm fine with that, since I won't be doing Meph again for a while, I assume. Runes are simply more guaranteed to give me what I'm missing.

Loots:

* 1 Ko rune
** I've filled my entire row of Ko out. I'll now be cubing up to Fal's (except my crafting runes).
