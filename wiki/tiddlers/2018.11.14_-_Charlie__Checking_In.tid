title: 2018.11.14 - Charlie: Checking In

Charlie and I talked for quite a while. As usual, we ran through a ton of topics. He still isn't sure about getting a computer. We talked extensively about Linux again. Admittedly, I am worried that he wouldn't be able to cut it, even though he has very specialized knowledge of computers dating back decades ago. This is well within the realm of something he could do, but I don't think he feels comfortable enough. I can respect that.

We talked about Biblical interpretation and several philosophy of language problems. Charlie continues to ask damned good questions. I think he is beginning to see where I'm coming from more effectively.

He seems to be doing okay. I'd like to see him.
