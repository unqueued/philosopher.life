It becomes clearer to me why I'm sometimes a world class duelist, but a terrible team sport player, particularly for larger maps. I'm extremely good at modeling 1v1 interactions, where there aren't too many variables to control for. I understand the matchup down to the minutiae. I'm not good at controlling for variables to be heuristically successful in large scale modeling. That isn't to say I can't at all. I'm still very far above average at modeling, but I'm not world class at it.
