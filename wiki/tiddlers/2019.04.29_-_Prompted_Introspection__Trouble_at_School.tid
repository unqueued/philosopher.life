title: 2019.04.29 - Prompted Introspection: Trouble at School

!! Tell about a time you got in trouble at school.

I didn't get into much trouble. I never had a paddling, a detention, a stand-in-the-corner, or any of that. Teachers didn't yell at me. Like a good little conservative boy, I followed the explicit rules and I was never overtly punished, though it's obvious I was punished for social rules I couldn't and didn't understand on my own. Most teachers enjoyed that I answered the questions they asked, but otherwise found me incredibly annoying (surprise!). Post-secondary education was wildly better in this respect.

I got kicked out of high school for hacking. I'm glad I did. My donors, of course, are profoundly responsible for the awful educations their offspring received under their care.
