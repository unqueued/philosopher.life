//In memory of Dr. Bowman of Berea College//

!! Which would you choose: immense wealth in obscurity or poverty and fame (think "starving artist")?

To what extent does wealth and fame (or fame-based social interactions, at least the appearances of them, leading to being likable, socially desired, etc.) fit together? It seems to me that sociopaths at the top are adept manipulators of human emotions as well as engineers of larger social machines. Their social engineering enables them to secure similar notions of "fame" in the right cases, times, and ways in order to advance themselves through a hierarchy and bend the social structure to their will. I do not think these peel apart very nicely.

More importantly, what do you mean by fame? Famous in what regard? Outside of the dopamine, it is useless to merely be known. Insofar as fame generates trust and desire, it is useful, but fame is not conceptually bound to that (you've been too generic in your question). 

Being known for creating something, now that could be a good reason. The example you give is a "starving artist." Well, not all art is equal, and I also have an incredibly wide conceptual analysis of [[Art]]. There are certain art forms that have enormous utility because they change how we think about the world, how we behave, etc. Is that what you have in mind? Insofar as you do, I see competing forms of power: standard wealth and memetic influence. Those also aren't very mutually exclusive. 

Insofar as wealth and fame reduce to power, what's the difference?<<ref "2019.03.21">>

I believe I would choose wealth. I would prefer to have the wealth to develop my own art, to have engineers and artists help me build my vision, etc. I think most people who have wealth have absolutely no idea how to wield it (but, I could say the same with fame).

Most importantly, this question reminds me one of my history professors quick-lenses he gave us: much of history can be understood it terms of the pursuit of fame and fortune. It is easy to distill religions in this way, for example. I'm immensely grateful for the opportunity to have sat in his classes.
