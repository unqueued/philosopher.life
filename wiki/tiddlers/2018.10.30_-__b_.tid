It appears that cannabis does help with my depression. If it is the lesser of two evils, even for IQ/Memory/Motivation, I'm having a hard time seeing why I shouldn't be high AF most of the time. It also appears cannabis' effects are reversible; it appears depression has far more permanent damage it can deal as well.
