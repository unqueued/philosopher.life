* Family Time!
* Ribs, wedges, veggies, pineapple
* WoW, ofc
* Write what you are going to right. I obviously can't convince you.
* You need to prep more magic decks for your students. 
* You need to bring more thumbdrives for your poor kids. There should be no reason for them not to do this with you.
