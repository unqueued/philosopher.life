title: 2017.05.03 - Philosophipolitical Prescription: Subsidized Opensource Computing

I'd love to see the United States government use their resources to build or help build highly secure open source software, hardware, and infrastructure. Our government should be leading the charge.  We really could build a world-class operating system that would secure the world. We should build hardware that is verifiably safe and not backdoored. We could stop a large portion of hacks and usher in a new technological age. 

They should take the Gnu/Linux project, or OpenBSD, or whatever, and just start contributing massively to it. They could build an easy to use, highly performant, and perhaps even provably secure software ecosystem (against significant threat models). I know, I know, you're thinking that they have a terrible track record (in so many ways). As a matter of pragmatism, I must have hope that we can do this well though. 

Bring the big players to the table. Are all the best software engineers in silicon valley working for big companies? Subsidize their work for the public good. Give reasonable stipulations. If they won't, then find a way to break their walled garden monopolies. Threaten their existence if they don't comply. 

Work with Intel, AMD, IBM, ARM, or even roll your own. Build hardware that is known to be safe.

We can make an infrastructure that is extremely difficult to attack, and we should. And we should give that software to everyone around the world. We should make privacy, security, and performance the norm. 

We should overhaul our digital infrastructure with opensource computing.
