Did you get training today?

Sorry, this is late. Yes, I did finish my video training. The orientation with Delp is tomorrow. First aid with Sonya the next day.
THU 9:56 PM
Sounds like a full schedule
THU 10:19 PM
I am waiting for the washer so I can throw stuff in the dryer and go to bed....Why must things always be urgently in need of washing at 9:30 but not at a reasonable time like 5
THU 10:20 PM
Indeed. Lol.
