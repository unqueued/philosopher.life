Between 1-4 parts on my brother's machine are broken. I can't troubleshoot though. That's okay. The modular PSU and i5 are keepable. 

I fixed my [[Python: Wiki Review Log Formatter]] script. =)

HTPC appears to enjoy the other wall socket, so thar it will go.

I have teamviewer working. It took some finesse, but it got there. Version 13 is native. It's fucking gorgeous, even if it is an MITM.

Worked on fitter.py with L and invisign with j3d1h.
