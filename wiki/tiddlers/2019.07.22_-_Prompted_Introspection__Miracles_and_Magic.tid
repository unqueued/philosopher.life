title: 2019.07.22 - Prompted Introspection: Miracles and Magic

!! What is an experience that you would consider a miracle?

I have none. It's striking to see this question come up given [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s letter. I don't believe in miracles, though like any decent deist, I believe in the miraculous. I cannot explain the membrane between ideality and materiality. Wisely speaking of the noumena might just be theoretical wisdom itself, and it is at the heart of philosophy. It does seem like contradictory magic to me.
