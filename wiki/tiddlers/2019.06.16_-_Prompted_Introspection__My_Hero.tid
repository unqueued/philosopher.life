title: 2019.06.16 - Prompted Introspection: My Hero

!! Who is your #1 hero? Why?

That's a tough one. I'm not sure how to define hero. Do we mean the person I respect the most? Clearly, that is [[Saint Diogenesocrates]]. If I'm required to point to a hero other people agree has existed, I will point to narratives of [[Saint Jesus]]. It's hard to beat someone who comes from nothing and points to the [[The Good]] and [[The Right]] so [[beautiful]]ly. Despite my disdain for almost everyone (~97%) who claims to be a follower of the Judeo-Christian memeplex (or basically anyone, lol), it's my honor to point to a hero and actually fucking mean it. [[Saint Plato]] is right up there, ofc, but he was a man of means.
