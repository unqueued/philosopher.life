title: 2019.03.27 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tragic Error

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The war was a “tragic error,” but not “fundamentally wrong or immoral” (as the overwhelming majority of the American people continue to believe), and surely not criminal aggression - the judgment that would be reached at once on similar evidence if the responsible agent were not the USA, or an ally or client. Our point is not that the retrospectives fail to draw what seem to us, as to much of the population, the obvious conclusions; the more significant and instructive point is that principled objection to the war as “fundamentally wrong and immoral,” or as an outright criminal aggression - a war crime - is inexpressible. It is not part of the spectrum of discussion. The background for such a principled critique cannot be developed in the media, and the conclusions cannot be drawn. It is not present even to be refuted. Rather, the idea is unthinkable. All of this reveals with great clarity how foreign to the mobilized media is a conception of the media as a free system of information and discussion, independent of state authority and elite interests.

Preach, yo!

Obviously, he doesn't mean what he's said is literally ineffable: the truth just isn't politically expedient. Those in power have no selfish reason to allow honest mainstream discussions of these kinds of aspects of reality. I hold nationalists, capitalists, and reactionaries responsible for this.

I remember losing a job because one of the board members of the private school had spoken with me earlier that year about the fact that I was opposed to war. She and her husband were out of the military, and he was a judge. They were a powerful family in the community, and I told it like it was. It's not just a tragic error on her part to call it a tragic error. She's fundamentally wrong and immoral for not pointing out what is fundamentally wrong and immoral, and that includes [[fff]] error margins.
