title: 2018.11.12 - Guitar: Rusty

My son and I both commented on how even 3 days of not practicing shows up for us. We can feel it. We tuned, played Minuet, and my son decided to practice strumming. Cool. I played some Canon in D.

My daughter did not get enough of her work done to practice. They are now required to finish mathematics before they begin music (because I'm tired of math not actually getting done).
