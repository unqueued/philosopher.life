I can see this book has a strong point of view. A philosopher is bound to be polemic, to fail to include everything that matters, etc. Russell, of course, has an axe to grind, like everyone else. I know full well that he's biased. That's okay. I still want to see what he has to say. I may have differing academic opinions, but I'm still interested in how he tells the story.

Jackpot! This person has excellent notes.

<<<
Heraclitus believed that "there would be no unity if there were not opposites to combine: 'it is the opposite which is good for us.'" "This doctrine contains the germ of Hegel's philosophy, which proceeds by a synthesising of opposites." (44). He saw change everywhere (44-45).
<<<

True enough.

<<<
"The notion of essence is an intimate part of every philosophy subsequent to Aristotle, until we come to modern times. It is, in my opinion, a hopelessly muddle-headed notion, but its historical importance requires us to say something about it." (200).
<<< 

Yikes!

<<<
"There is, in fact, an element of sour grapes in Stoicism. We can't be happy, but we can be good; let us therefore pretend that, so long as we are good, it doesn't matter being unhappy. This doctrine is heroic, and, in a bad world, useful; but it is neither quite true nor, in a fundamental sense, quite sincere." (269). The Stoics did, however, come up with the idea of natural right and of all human beings being equal. (270).
<<<

Fascinating. I make the exact opposite charge of modern stoics! I can provide charitable readings in that light of ancients, but I don't think they must be read that way either.

<<<
There is little of the true philosophic spirit in Aquinas. He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead. He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times. (463).
<<<

Zing! This, of course, must be carried over to the transcendental philosophers, right? 

<<<
The merits of Hobbes appear most clearly when he is contrasted with earlier political theorists. He is completely free from superstition; he does not argue from what happened to Adam and Eve at the time of the Fall. He is clear and logical; his ethics, right or wrong, is completely intelligible, and does not involve the use of any dubious concepts. Apart from Machiavelli, who is much more limited, he is the first really modern writer on political theory. Where he is wrong, he is wrong from over-simplification, not because the basis of his thought is unreal and fantastic. (556).
<<<

Clearly, this book has shaped my teachers as well.

<<<
"Almost all philosophers, in their ethical systems, first lay down a false doctrine, and then argue that wickedness consists in acting in a manner that proves it false, which would be impossible if the doctrine were true." 
<<<

Striking hard at [[The Categorical Imperative]]. You have my attention!!

<<<
It remains to be asked whether any meaning can be attached"to the words "mind" and "matter." Every one knows that "mind" is what an idealist thinks there is nothing else but, and "matter" is what a materialist thinks the same about. The reader knows also, I hope, that idealists are virtuous and materialists are wicked. But perhaps there may be more than this to be said. (658).
<<<

This is a fascinating claim. It seems to me that in seeking [[The Good]], we are trying to make something material to us, we are being empiricists in a weird way, we are claiming a matter outside the mind, we are externalists, we are not idealists in this way. The idealist, on such an account, does not believe in an ideal outside one consciousness, which is hardly ideal at all. I'm an idealist in the sense of an ideal external to me. I think it's practical and ideal.

I can tell I am in for an absolute treat! 

<<<
Infinitely extending this type of explanation, Russell's "definition" then becomes, "'matter' is the thing we try to predict with equations of physics, and if there is nothing there that we're trying to predict, then there is no matter." This is certainly true, and is moreover tautological. It is more of an identification than a definition, however, as there are many other ways to describe matter, similarly based upon human experiences and linguistics.
<<<

But, that's a definition //should// do, right? 

<<<
Modern Protestants who urge us to believe in God, for the most part, despise the old "proofs," and base their faith upon some aspect of human natureâ€”emotions of awe or mystery, the sense of right and wrong, the feeling of aspiration, and so on. This way of defending religious belief was invented by Rousseau. It has become so familiar that his originality may easily not be appreciated by a modern reader, unless he will take the trouble to compare Rousseau with (say) Descartes or Leibniz. (691).
<<<

Powerful words! There is a [[Redpill]] here. 

<<<
The conception in Rousseau's mind [between the will of all and the general will] seems to be this: every man's political opinion is governed by self-interest, but self-interest consists of two parts, one of which is peculiar to the individual, while the other is common to all the members of the community. If the citizens have no opportunity of striking log-rolling bargains with each other, their individual interests, being divergent, will cancel out, and there will be left a resultant which will represent their common interest; this resultant is the general will. (698).
<<<

Gorgeous.

Philosophy sits between science and theology.

You can see Russell's political leanings, time period, and biases upfront. I don't mind that.

I love how he calls Locke insane.

Interestingly, doesn't think that of Libertarians, on average...

This turns out to have more historical context than I had expected. That's interesting.

Stoicism really doesn't make sense. =(

<<<
In a tired age, even real goods lose their savor.
<<<

Sometimes Russell it witty, sometimes he slashes deep, and sometimes he's just dry as fuck.
