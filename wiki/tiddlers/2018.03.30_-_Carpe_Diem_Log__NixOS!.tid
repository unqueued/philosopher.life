title: 2018.03.30 - Carpe Diem Log: NixOS!

* Woke at 7 something, nightmare.
* I realized I needed to just let my daughter off the hook and try again. That's what we're doing.
* Talked to her about it. 
* Son and I made breakfast for family.
* We had a good morning family time.
* School
* Bliss
* Solved plenty of problems. A post from a redditor and a problem with Resilio sync sent me down a rabbithole.
** Children and I talked for many hours about the problem.
* Read+Write
* Called JRE, AIR, L, C, and ALM. Lol. Sad.
** MB messaged me.
** Found out JRE was working late.
* Last snacks before fasting tomorrow!
* Fell asleep at midnightish?
