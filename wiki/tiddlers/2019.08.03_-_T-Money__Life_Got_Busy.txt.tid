I apologize for not responding last weekend. Life got busy.

How are you doing sir?
AUG 2 11:11 PM
Hey! Don't worry man. Of the people I speak with, you must be one of the most consistent and persistent responders. I know life gets stupid busy too. How did it go? How's your wife's back?
AUG 2 11:38 PM
I'm doing well. Been building digital machines with my offspring. It's good to have them back. More stressful, but I'm glad they are here.

Wife worked this week. She seems to be back to semi normal. Thank you for asking I have some cool pics of art she did while she took two weeks off. I am also glad to have my kiddo back. Stress yes. But I don't like being alone. Or alone with my wife. I think she thinks about my life insurance policy too. Jk

Lol!
AUG 2 11:42 PM
I'm glad she's doing better. Both your backs have not been doing well. =/
AUG 2 11:42 PM
I'd like to see her art, of course, when you have the chance to show me.
AUG 2 11:42 PM
You know I like to share photos. Last weekend we were in Indiana getting Samantha.
AUG 2 11:47 PM
I drove home after work. South 90. Cut grass, showered, andpacked. Then drove north 6hrs to north if Indianapolis. To my I laws. It was a very long day. We arrived at 2 am. But the wife got to go to a petting zoo with her mom, sis, neice, and daughter Friday, and more fun on Sat. It was a good visit and worth the long Thursday. I was up 24+ hrs by the time I went to sleep. Lol

They are painted on metal I cut out. The big Cheryl Caddy shack is for our golf cart barn/chicken coop. It's like 3 foot wide
 The dog is small about the size of a 5 gal bucket.

Looking to create a target range for bb guns off my back porch. With the audible "dink" for each hit target.

So she is making cool stuff to shoot at. In short. I rarely get to see her paint so I get happy and give her lots o praise.

My daughter named our golf cart big Cheryl. Which I found halarious. And it is black and white. The words big Cheryl make. Me thing of a heifer of a woman. In my head the painting. The sign, the name its all halarious.

Every vehicle needs a name.
AUG 3 1:20 AM
I disagree.
AUG 3 1:20 AM
But I don't get attached. Hahah. Golf cart should be last one I ever have to buy. I let them name her.
