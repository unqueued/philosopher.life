Everyone has to wrestle with his work. Non-Realist Cognitivism is not something I can abide by; he doesn't actually give the argument for it either, imho. Cognitive of what? 

<<<
Parfit rejected this argument, claiming that it cedes too much to a non-materialist worldview; a worldview which in On What Matters Parfit implied he is keen to abandon in order to put morals on an objective foundation not dependent on God or other spectral entities for support.

I'm a Platonist; so I bite the bullet openly to have the correspondence that he doesn't. I beg that question. It's a matter of faith to me. I understand the desires of appealing to naturalism (or something like it), but I'm still convinced we must buy metaphysics whole-hog in the end (I think that's exactly what symbolic logic forces us to admit). That's what philosophy is really doing at the end of the day, even if it humbly attempts to do so in a deflationary fashion.

Imho, there's a contradiction at The Bottom (the symbol of absurdity itself) we must accept as true on faith, a dialetheia. Where do we begin to accept such a thing and why? That too likely [[infinigress]]. The intelligibility of the world is at stake. It's finding the lowest/best "Bob" turtle of turtles all the way down. It's just our plight. I do think I have to minimize the vulnerability surface as much as possible, stabilize my boat as much as I can, etc. 

I adore Parfit for his casuistry and intuition pumps, but I'm not sold on my (perhaps poor) understanding of his systematic philosophy. I'm not ashamed of my faith in a rich notion of metaphysics though.

<<<
Most of us feel we are morally responsible to ourselves and, at best, only to those others who we personally choose to assume obligations towards for affective reasons.
<<<

The problem with sentiment.

<<<
 the idea that the self is what matters was wrong because we have good philosophical reasons to stop believing that there is such a ‘self’ in any strong sense.
<<<

That is a popular view cross-culturally. It's likely unsolvable for the [[fff]], and I appreciate the attempt at humility in it. The problem is that we cannot reason effectively about the infinite. I hold intuitionist, paraconsistent, meta, and linear logics in high regard because they at least attempt to give us safer threads to perceive what's outside the cave. We have to construct our faiths in metaphysics wisely. Identity, not just agency (which is where Parfit tends to focus), is a root problem in the relationship between ontology and epistemology.

I appreciate your quick walk through the problem in analytic and continental traditions.

<<<
Parfit argued that throughout Western philosophy there have been four major and variably convincing answers given to the question “What is the self?”  First is the claim that the self is simply the body. Second is the claim that the self is the immortal soul that exists both outside and within the body and mind. Third is the claim that the self is the brain. And fourth is the argument that the self is our memories:
<<<

I don't take these to be mutually exclusive (which perhaps means I've missed the whole point). I think my mind is mostly reducible to an instatiation of an algorithm which can be represented as a string of 0's and 1's. I'd say the same about my body and brain. I tend to see my nervous system as being more constitutive of me than other systems. I agree with his teleportation/replica intuition. There is something about my particular instantiation of my algorithm that makes me really me. That ghost in the machine problem may still be solvable if I'm aware of trickling into another body or brain. The memory of my transition formed by my own processes (which makes teleportation an unlikely possibility still) seems pretty crucial. There is still the faith of waking up and the Theseus problem as always.

Obviously, I have no treatise to offer.
