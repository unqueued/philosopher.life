title: 2018.06.18 - Deep Reading: Demon

What a dark, absurd, and existential comic book. I've asked my wife for the entire set.

It has the //Fallen// film's thing going on. 

The demon doesn't look Asian, as he claims.

The scene in the police station is just plain funny. It's morbidly immoral.

It's interesting how his discovery of being a demon is a reason he begins to find his life worth living, so much so that he takes the lives of others without much thought.

Holy shit this is messed up, lol. He's inventing ways to kill himself. This escape is actually interesting. The cum knife is just funny. He has clearly set up this demon to explore himself and the world with a very cool mechanic.
