title: Outopos: Domain Names

Some problems are harder than others to solve. Zooko's Paradox is never ultimately solved, although we keep edging closer and closer a practical semblance of an answer. Outopos should remain as agnostic in this issue as possible and leverage as many tools as available. 

A domain name should be able to point to at least one the following things:

* Another Primary Domain Name
** Any number of secondary domain names in sequential order
* A Primary IPv4 address on the internet
** Any number of secondary IPv4 addresses on the internet in sequential order
* A Primary IPv6 address on the internet
** Any number of secondary IPv6 addresses on the internet in sequential order
* A Primary Outopos Public Key of any kind
** Any number of secondary Outopos Public Keys of any kind in sequential order
* A primary 64-Byte block of data
** Any number 64-Byte blocks of data in sequential order

There are a number of DNS resolvers to consider:

* The Internet's DNS system
* Namecoin
* Monero Openalias
* Perhaps Blockstack

Outonyms will be records of them all. Outopos-DNS resolves will be federated. Let us say X number of Outokens buys 1 Primary Outonym, and each round of secondary elements costs X/2 Outokens.

Federations will require game-theoretically sound voting.
