title: 2017.11.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: Content Censor/Selector

!! If it were your job to decide what shows can be on t.v., how would you choose?

I do not trust myself to make these selections. I see the line between content selection and censorship, to some degree. I would take such a responsibility very seriously. You are asking me to program humanity in a very influential way.

I think I would require us to engage in the dialectic, to think critically, to understand epistemic duty, and to force ourselves to be philosophical. That's the only requirement I can give. Exactly what content beyond that, I do not feel I should attempt to enforce. I do not have the answers. Of course, I'm not sure I can even give you a good example of what counts as my requirement either. I would hope, however, that I would eliminate a ton of trash, braincandy, and memes that ultimately prevent us from improving and doing the right thing as a species.
