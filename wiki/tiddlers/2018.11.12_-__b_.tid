Noticing in /r/QuotesPorn a fuckton of Buffett quotes. Walking through the accounts of posters. Conspiracy theory time: this isn't an accident.

I'm going to be forever pwned just for the predictive and speech-to-text abilities. A few years ago, I could dismiss these because I performed better by hand. I can't now. If I want AI to help me ease the friction of getting shit from my head into words on a digital page without using a real keyboard, I'm almost forced to accept this MITM attack on my identity. They aren't going to release the secret sawce; they will always maintain their monopoly. 

Even if I become an excellent typist on the phone, it will be no match for being an excellent typist who leverages prediction, translation, and speech-to-text. More importantly, the cognitive load of typing on a smartphone with AI is lower. I hate how mobile owns me.
