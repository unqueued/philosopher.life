I'm checkin' in with ya. How's it going?
FRI 11:44 AM

Yesterday, I ate a clock.

It was very time consuming.

Especially when I went back for seconds.
SAT 9:44 PM
That's a dang good joke.
SAT 9:56 PM
Lol. Yeah. May it be a virus unto Humanity!
SAT 9:57 PM
Groans for everyone.
SAT 9:57 PM
How's life going?
SAT 9:57 PM
:joy: and how are yall this evening? Is it 10 there?
SAT 9:58 PM
Yeah, it's 10. Kids are showering, heading to bed. [[k0sh3k]] and I are working on picking out writing samples for a job I'm applying at the EFF.
SAT 9:59 PM
We had a date today (extremely rare for us normally).
SAT 10:00 PM
She wrote a poem for me today too: https://philosopher.life/#2019.02.02%20-%20k0sh3k%3A%20Poem%3A%20Dialectic
SAT 10:00 PM
Been a busy but good week.
SAT 10:00 PM
It's going! Hiw about for you?
SAT 10:01 PM
Hrmm. We must be de-synced or something. Lol. I think messages aren't being delivered normally.
SAT 10:02 PM
I can see the receipts aren't working as expected. This is interesting.
SAT 10:03 PM
I read [[k0sh3k]]'s poem! 

I loved:
 Swinging wide,
Striving for the center,
Spiraling around and down and towards the Center Star
SAT 10:08 PM
What writing samples are in the maybe pile so far?
SAT 10:08 PM
Here's the position: https://www.eff.org/opportunities/jobs/privacy-and-surveillance-activist
SAT 10:09 PM
You and this job were made for one another.
SAT 10:10 PM
Preach!
SAT 10:11 PM
I know I won't get it, but I don't give a fuck. I'm going to write the most badass cover letter ever.
SAT 10:11 PM
Yes!! Air fist pumping so hard over here!
SAT 10:11 PM
That's going to be one of my writing samples, btw. I'm going to have a "standard" cover letter embedded in the wiki, and one of my writing samples is going to be an article which allows me to detail (in all of my insanity) why I am qualified to have this position...which will be very link heavy (internal the wiki), irreverent, and maybe even a bit funny. So...that "extended" cover letter article will be one writing sample, I think.
SAT 10:13 PM
I'm going to drop this in there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1BnKd7RrjE
SAT 10:13 PM
I'm going full ballsy jester in there.
SAT 10:13 PM
You get to see one of the superpowers of the wiki now.
SAT 10:15 PM
https://philosopher.life/#:%5B%5B2018.12.05%20-%20JYU%3A%20Thank%20You%20For%20The%20Gift%5D%5D%20%5B%5BThe%20Original%20Position%5D%5D%20%5B%5B2014.11.10%20-%20Challenges%20in%20Quasi-Lockean%20Intellectual%20Property%20Theory%5D%5D%20%5B%5BCryptographic%20Verification%5D%5D%20%5B%5BLegal%20Notice%5D%5D%20%5B%5BContact%20h0p3%5D%5D
SAT 10:15 PM
Those are some of the candidates we've dug out. One of them is a letter to an ex-FB employee (a millionaire) where I tell him how much of a sinner he really is (as kindly as I can).
SAT 10:16 PM
I have the first chapter of my dissertation in there (and any of their legal scholars in the topic should cum rainbows if they see it).
SAT 10:16 PM
I'll be talking about my work with [[BDS97]] on [[Atropos]] (a radical replacement for Tor and TCP).
SAT 10:17 PM
The superpower, btw, is the ability to load up what I have on my screen with a single link. I can tell a story with multiple tiddlers (I have ~8k tiddlers).
SAT 10:17 PM
I've also got a [[Legal Notice]] which demonstrates my understanding for a number of significant legal problems, imho.
SAT 10:18 PM
My Cryptographic Verification page shows I'm not a noob (even if I'm still a beginner) who understands its value and can use the primitives (I believe). I put my money where my mouth is there.
SAT 10:19 PM
My Contact page is extremely controversial. I think they are going to have incredibly strong reactions to it, and I should point out how much I understand the ethical implications of weighing freespeech rights and privacy rights.
SAT 10:20 PM
The good news is that because of how linking (and tagging) works in the wiki, I can technically create doorways which map onto the rest of the web of my wiki as hard as I want. It's cheating, but good. I need to fucking cheat. They need to know I understand how to write hypertext.
SAT 10:22 PM
So, I can have more than 5 explicit writing samples in a way.
SAT 10:22 PM
But, I need explicit ones.
SAT 10:22 PM
This is so interesting! How do they take resumes? Is it the standard Email It In?
SAT 10:24 PM
I've not gone through the application process. I believe I will be uploading a PDF of my resume, and I'll upload the wiki as the cover letter. If I understand correctly, the application process on their site will require links as input, and I'll be linking to https://philosopher.life/FOOBAR for each writing sample.
SAT 10:26 PM
(FOOBAR doesn't exist, just a variable/placeholder here)
SAT 10:26 PM
One thing that is going to blow their minds (or at least be a fancy trick to show them), imho, is that the entire wiki will be included with the cover letter. I'll just set the "GettingStarted" to the cover letter in that particular html file (normally it's [[Root]] and [[Legal Notice]]).
SAT 10:28 PM
Keep me updated on the job application process! I hope this goes wonderfully:):):):)
SAT 10:33 PM
Will do, guvnuh. I'll send you the cover letter when it's ready too.
SAT 10:33 PM
Yes!
SAT 10:48 PM
How's your weekend been?
