I have no idea why summaries aren't a serious public service. Crystallizing information for the masses is obviously necessary. I'm surprised that authors don't do it themselves.

Sounds like an ex machina.

High praise. I'm growing convinced it isn't my cup of tea. I'm going to do my best to savor it for my wife though.

My wife is probably going to love this book, as long as it doesn't get too corny.

Second-personal sections of this book. Ugh. My brain no work. Excessively descriptive.

The question of innate talent vs learned sounds like a discussion between rationalists and empiricists, but with magic. 

The Harry Potter moment, the special seed that grows, that introduction to magic, the Alice in Wonderland, or I don't know what to call it, it is captivating in this book.

I seriously don't understand what motivates the duel though. Why the fuck does Prospero and this Grey Suit dude really give a shit? Why are they in this combat? They just want the best pawn? This doesn't make sense. I can't see it from their eyes well enough.

Lots of philosophical questions. It might just be my lense talking through my interpreting though.

Magic and secret relationship is not boring, but also not necessarily right. It has the Octavia Butler thing going on it seems (at least as a reminder or pointer), although not on purpose, I suspect. Insofar as we cannot reveal the secrets of who we are (various postmodern problematics and logistics), such secrets appear to be rooted in a magic, trust, faith, unknown, etc.

I really hope they graphically fuck!

These artificial worlds with magic are almost never meaningful enough to me. I'm extremely hard to please in the realm of magic because of my insane pursuit of realism, of truth, of coherence. Somehow, authors' inability to translate the cascading effects of magic into the various contingent truths which comprise the possible worlds they have crafted are never even remotely coherent. I feel like I'm reading the works of retarded children who are too naive to realize the limits, possibilities, and consequences in their experience machines. Suspending my disbelief can only go so far. It's too obviously a simulacrum that doesn't follow the rules that I expect to be followed in every possible world. Essentially, even given the possibility of magic assumed in the books, they don't follow enough of the rules of reality to generate the right kind of meanings in the right way for me. 

In a way, this book is challenging for me. I don't think author meant it to be challenging in this way, and she would probably be horrified/disgusted by what I take to be challenging about it, as though I have "missed the point." I suspect most people would go insane if they wrestled as I do.

I dub this genre the Fantasy of Fantasy. I think it tells me something about my current problem with modality, btw. My worry that is that the world is reduced to absurdity. I desperately hope for the world not to be reduced to absurdity and meaninglessness. I have fought very hard in my philosophy to construct my way out of such deconstructions. I do not want to swallow the poison. I want the least surd-elim'd telos/meaning. The less magic I rely upon philosophically, the better. The truth, scary, uncertain, difficult as it may be, is the suffering we must endure for the kind of meaning that matters the most [[adok]], [[gfwiwcgws]], [[irwartfrr]] ([[agi]]), etc.
