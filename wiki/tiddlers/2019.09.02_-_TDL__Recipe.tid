title: 2019.09.02 - TDL: Recipe

* So, you set out to do writing, and...you basically didn't. I'm shocked, I tell you.
** Only one audit left though.
* [[m17]]'s Bob seems to up and running. Need to setup the VPN.
** Our Bob recipe still isn't where it must be.
* We're running out of shows to watch, but it's not like we are watching much these days. 
** It comes and goes. 
* Make sure the actual recipe for what your wife cooked is recorded.
* Either shop today or tomorrow.
* Set up the Shadowcaster; be prepared to raid as it. Parsing would be nice.
