title: Pipefitting To-do-list

!! Definitely:

* Self-monitor program to continually guard against letting my flame die 

* Watch pipefitter videos

* Study for exams over breaks, and push hard through the NCCER curriculum
** Don't forget to get the study points.

* Read my Union history books
** Prepare talking points (although, we know Randy hasn't actually read them thoroughly).

!! Maybe:

* [[Pipevan]]
