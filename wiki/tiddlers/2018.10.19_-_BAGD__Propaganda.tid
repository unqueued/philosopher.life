title: 2018.10.19 - BAGD: Propaganda

My kids clearly live in a bubble. We might be poor, but they are extremely educated for their ages. I have to explain what other kids are experiencing, demonstrate it to them in books, video, articles, and via other kids. Socialization is incredibly important to me, and I say that as an autist who has to reverse engineer it all the time. I have to show my children the Platonic [[Beauty]] while also effectively describing the Orwellian dystopia. 

We talked about the kinds of textbooks, nationalism, daily practices, and political structures I grew up with. We walked through what they are missing out on, some of it sucks to miss out on, but some of it is radically the wrong kind of socialization and education. 

This was all sparked by my daughter's complaint of Menelaus' verbosity. God damn, we rabbithole hard. 

Handed [[Hegel in 90 Minutes]] to [[j3d1h]]. It's a humorous introduction.

Also encouraged them to write letters to their donors who had winter hats delivered to us last night: Thank you, Donors! I don't believe you mean it, but it is useful to my children nonetheless.
