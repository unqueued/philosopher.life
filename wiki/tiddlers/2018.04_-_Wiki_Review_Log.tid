!! Audit:

* I actually missed some individual logs throughout the month. This is not normal for me!
* I wrote a good deal. I spawned many projects as well. I'm glad!
* I think the tite.Titles are super useful for this particular log. It lines up and tells dat sequence.
* Many of my links rot out in this section, but I'm okay with that. I kind of like to have something to trace. 
* I don't know how much use it served. It was meta, but I can't see clearly what it did anymore. It used to be more obvious to me, even though I've often expressed doubts. yet, I am glad I do it!
* It is very clear that I've been spending time, giving shape to myself and my projects here. 
* "That I did"
* These are emotional, and it's interesting to "relive" the month through this log.
* I somehow also felt like I spun my wheels and didn't accomplish what I wanted to? Am I holding myself to unreasonable expectations?
* The acronyms have been useful, some more than others. I will slowly build them up, I hope. It may take many years.
* Oh, I forgot how much I added this month. Wowsers. I did throw some meat on them bones. Admittedly, it's ambitious and shotgunny. It's a start though!
* Ah, I'm glad this wiki review gives me hesitation, moment's to just hold off fora bit, that extra space to think about it, another glance, etc. It's also funny how I don't always know what will be useful and when.
* Mmm. I had an interesting line, and I'm trying to phrase it better: "Make sure it is only your projects and not yourself that fails" or whatever it takes to recognize that you need to get things wrong in order to improve, take risks, etc. I will have to find a more elegant way to say it for my Antipleonasms. 
** Help me, k0sh3k!
* I ended up not loving [[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]] after I got into it, or I somehow quickly disconnected from it. I want to try it again.
* I did some [[Wiki Audit Log]] work in here. It snuck in. I'd prefer I spent my time showing myself how I'm shaping the wiki in general like that. It's a different thing, or so I think? Is that wrong? I have long had this debate.
* Hah, that prank would have been funny. I'm glad we didn't do it though.
* I forgave myself several times this month. Good!
* So many explosions on the wiki this month!
* This log has afforded me countless opportunities to correct my work from the previous day. I don't always do a great job, but sometimes it really works out. I'm glad I afford myself that chance.
* I've noticed that "Recent" as the better alternative keeps showing up. I need to give more thought to how I can do it. Part of the problem is that it isn't usually necessary. But, it would be valuable to think more about it. Perhaps that should be my goal? I can skip out on boilerplate. Yeah, my core requirement log directories get edited every day (no shit), but I don't want them included unless I've really modified the content of them outside of the index (that is a harder problem for me to solve at the moment). I think I should just automate it in my python script. 
** See, I want to make sure that I'm cheering on myself when I work on stuff that isn't simply New. New is exciting. It feels like raw addition, but editing, revising, and working on stable furnishings for this wiki is one of the main points, and I should not only celebrate that, but also force myself to have something to say about my edits a day after.
