title: 2017.04.16 - DCK Meditation

Not well. Not well enough that I decided to take DCK. DCK was the catalyst of this wiki. It is a very powerful substance. It is a substance which requires wrestling. 

I associate DCK with incredibly painful experiences. I wrestle while using DCK. It's a very different kind of drug. It is not the one which I enjoy using, but it is the one I use because I should. 

My depression isn't gone. The wolf is still on my back. I'm wrestling. My life always feels like it is in shambles.

I swatted [[1uxb0x]] with our plastic spatula against his arm hard. I can see a welt. I am a fucking monster. That is not who I want to be. I shouldn't have done that. I'm out of emotional energy. I do not know how to help them. I'm going to try to figure out how anyways, because I must. I need to help them be happy.

Creators are slaves to their creations in many contexts. 

They really are my source of a reason to live. The bedrock. I want these tiny flowers (over which I am not a skilled gardener) to flourish. I will be molded and shaped until they are happy. That is what it means be a slave. 

I am still in a tailspin. I cannot correct the axes. There are too many directions to handle.

I feel like this journal takes a blow torch to the world. 

I almost killed myself yesterday. I decided not to live several times. I fought it though. I am mentally ill. There might be a cure, there might not. The splinters in my mind require precision we do not have available to us today.

That is okay. I will find a way.

I want to meditate. What is meditation? Meditation is this thing I thought was stupid for the longest time. It is giving ourselves time to compute.

We're listening to ourselves when we meditate.

I want my kids to meditate 1 minute each day. Then 2 minutes. Then 3. 

I want them to snowball. Let's say 30 minutes each day. That is a completely reasonable thing to do. We'll start small and build our way up. 

My problem with meditation is how untrustworthy it is, how unscientific it is. There is plenty of evidence that we should engage in the behavior, but there is little explanation for what it really, ultimately, does.

Two kids just brought me "Easter bracelets." It is sunny outside, and yet it feels derealized (that's DCK for you).

I want to just be in the here and now.  I want zero substances. Everyone wants happiness in itself, unconditionally. I am dependent upon substances, and whether or not I actually succeed depends upon using them wisely. I must 

I need to watch hunt for the wilder people again.

Honesty allows us to maximize our signal-to-noise ratio. It allows us to be who we are, feels integrated, to be authentic, to be genuine, and to be ourselves. 

There is a weird way in which genius is fun. Seriously. You see the world in a way that others just don't. You can't expect them to see it. It isn't fair to them. They can't see it. Your job is to help them see it.  

So much psychopathy at the top. It is absurd. Don't you see it?!? Psychopathic Culture is real. That meme is strong.

The world is fundamentally programmatic. All of it. I need to step on Calvin so I can reach up to 

The standard of the good of influence, as a secular and neutral thing, is your ability to make waves in the memetic pond. It is the ability to see the Butterfly Effect of Chaos. 

The tides of evil are against all of us. We must, brick-by-brick, fight back.

Go with the flow.~

Are we building towards something? What is it? Why should we?

I am a computer floating through a computational world. 

Most programs fail, in incredibly complex ways. 

Applying the theory of utilitarianism perfectly requires that we figure a way for people to selfishly live together. Empathizing with selfishness is very hard. I am walking through a fog. 

The goal is for each of us to be as happy as we can given our capacities.
