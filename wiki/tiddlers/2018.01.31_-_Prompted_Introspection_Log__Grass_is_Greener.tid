title: 2018.01.31 - Prompted Introspection Log: Grass is Greener

!! What do we mean when we say, "The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence"?

Sounds like a great stoic quote. This is about refactoring our perceptions, expectations, and standards of happiness. It is easy to see this quote as some envy story.<<ref "1">> Insofar as envy is failing to appreciate what we have (and not about justified claims against immorality and injustice), it can be hazardous. 

There are many ways to talk about this quote in general, including FOMO: the fear of missing out. It's good that we prefer who we are, where we are, what we are, etc., in a sense. I don't think that such reasoning extends all the way down, and it's far from unconditional. Essentially, sometimes the grass really is greener on the other side. Thus, this quote is not accurate. It's an exaggeration. There are times when we know it isn't greener, and the implication that "it's always greener" thus it is never actually greener is also false.

Those who wield it as a truism, however, must be watched. It is so obviously false in its literality that they must have an agenda to doubletalk with it. That said, I think there are plenty of relatively sane people who use this with the unspoken caveat and understanding of its exaggeration. That it has exceptions doesn't mean it isn't an important rule of thumb, a lens we should consider.

Thus, I have been inspired to start collecting [[Simple Proverbs]] in [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]. This will be the first.<<ref "2019.03.26">>

<<footnotes "2019.03.26" "It's fascinating to see how [[Prompted Introspection]] has been pushing for [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] for so long. I still might be missing pieces of the puzzle (almost certainly, right?), but I feel like I'm making progress. It's hard to be explicit and constructive enough with myself.">>
