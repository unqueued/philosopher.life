My brother called me up. It was such a long phone conversation that I can't remember everything. My brother will have to help me fill in the gaps.

He talked about what he said to [[j3d1h]]. He talked about [[self-dialectic]] and how our brains might include collections of computers working together. [[The Original Position]], Frankfurtian-Parfitian Ship of Theseus [[4DID]] problems, we scaled it out.

He told me about a dream (no, he is never the kind that sees magic in dreams) that sparked a series of thoughts in him. He is encountering [[T4T]] vs [[T42T]] reasoning in work social circles. We had many parallels to talk about in our work. He talked to me about my afterschool program posting too. I'm extremely grateful that he is thinking with me.

We talked about therapy, parenting, and a wide variety of topics. We continued to plow into //Dune// and several other references. 

Sometimes I wish I was taking notes as we talked. My memory is just not good enough. Anyway, it was one of the best conversations I've had with him in a long time.

He has asked me to engage in Yoga to prime me for meditation. This is a good idea.
