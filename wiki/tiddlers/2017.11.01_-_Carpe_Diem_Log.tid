title: 2017.11.01 - Carpe Diem Log

* I've noticed I've been spending more time picking up the little things (not in an annoyed way, but in a good normal way).

---

* Woke at 9
** Haven't been drunk in a while, and I'm going to keep it that way. =)
* Routine Morning Routine
* D2
* NCCER
* Cleaning
* Mathematics
* Read+Write
* Cannabliss
* Fireman Time x2!
* Talked to JRE & K
** Pretty sure I annoyed K by the end.
* Tried reaching Charlie, L, and MB
** MB said she call back, but she didn't.
* Quesadillas, Salad, and Fruits
** I'm glad I have my kids cook with me. 
* Read+Write
* Wife came home, and we had a clear disagreement before bed over the notion of property rights. She's dismissive, but as am I. 
** Not worth debating. She's not interested in argumentation here. A sad parting of ways.
* Fell asleep in my own bed. Laptop + earbuds helped.
