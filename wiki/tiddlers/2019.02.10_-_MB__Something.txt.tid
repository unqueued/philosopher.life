It goes. Grinding away in the wiki.

School's been fine. Reflecting on the week with the family.

Worked hard on my cover letter to the EFF

Parts of it are finalized, but I realized that I'm going to need to be even more explicit about who I am with them.

I'm rickrolling them twice in the letter. It's balls-out.

How's Adam doing?

What you been up to?

This is a damn good resume. Holy heck.

That was like reading a good book. I cant think of another feeling to compare it too. I got to the end and felt like, "ah, the universe of that topic was explained to me concisely but to the full extent."

And I think I found the two  rickrolls (YouTube video and your signature?)

I also appreciate that when I click on the footnotes, the text pops up right there. I'm so used to having to flip to an appendix in a physical book or, with an ebook, having to navigate back and forth with a clumsy table of contents or just clicking back and forth through pages. The formatting of your wiki is so damn good.

Wow! Thank you. That is insanely high praise. I am doing my best!

Aye. " I'll just bite the bullet and drop the pretense of formality here." and footnote "But wait, there's more! You can plainly see I also appreciate the value of calculated humor in the workplace."

I'm glad you like the formatting! The wiki is funtionally an awesome tool for forming things.
