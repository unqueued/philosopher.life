title: 2018.04.17 - Deep Reading Log: A Higher Loyalty

Preachy from the beginning. Virtue preface that one might expect.

Let's be clear, I think FBI are capitalist pigs who empower elites. Comey is NOT a good human being. He is better than Trump though, and unfortunately, he's the only one with the information.

Mafia intro is interesting, and it tells his story of becoming a man of the law. Philosophy justifying his existence, *sigh.

The autobiography is at least fast. Name-dropping and hero-worship that I'm not impressed by, but I don't hold the same ends as this man. I don't care about his stories. I assume this is a virtue signal necessary to build up the appearance of someone with moral integrity, etc. Sounds like conservative trash to me.

The "great leadership" is forced. I'm sure it will make a compelling rhetorical/emotional argument against Trump while making him feel vindicated in the process. Keep going for the anti-bully angle though. Trump clearly is that.

Yes, I hear your Christian bullshit. Move on.

I love how he thinks that he is somehow a person of integrity who doesn't care what other people think, that he goes against what the crowd wants, etc. When you look closely at the notion of the rule of law, you'll find that it's about setting aside what you think for the sake of following the rules that everyone "agrees" to. I don't worship the rule of human law. I don't have faith in authority like this man generally appears to. I don't think Comey actually has a high loyalty to eternal values, nor I am convinced he's philosophical. 

It's possible that the alt-right will receive a smackdown from the conservatives who agree to this book's mentality, but it does not solve the problems of capitalism. I fear this is a tool to otherise and not solve the fundamental problems at all. Comey's view is overly simplistic, and I think that actually prevents people from thinking correctly about our political climate.

He drones.

I do appreciate his attempt, at least in his own mind, to be non-partisan. Unfortunately, I think he still has worked his entire life to uphold the interests of the powerful rather than the powerless.

I think it's gross that someone would have anything in their job they wouldn't discuss with their spouse.

Diversity is not the problem. /facepalm

Addiction to the FBI is not likely for the reasons Comey thinks.

Clearly proud of his redpilled signaling. 

Sportsball metaphor/lesson.

He's outright against Communism. He thinks he did something by commanding a curriculum for MLK. Lol. I'm sorry. I don't buy it.

He sees that he isn't trusted. He doesn't get why the lack of trust is justified. He doesn't have the right explanation. 

It's not just about black people: this is a capitalism problem. You piece of shit.

His work is optical.

He thinks its just tribalism, that he is the hero of his own story, that he has the objective truth (despite his denial and attempts to say we are all biased, including himself). 

His discussion with Obama shows how little Comey really understood. He should never have been in power.

His discussion of encryption is disgusting. His inability to value privacy is ridiculous.

The tech types have seen darkness. They understand the costs, and in fact, they are actually awful at this themselves. I've been following this for decades now. You are part of the problem.

What's shocking is that the doesn't understand how much power NGO's actually wield. People own congress, and they are wealthy. The surveillance state isn't merely a product of the 3 letter agencies, but an global economic system that enables transnational corporations to skirt laws everywhere. There is no rule of law; that is an illusion.

He really just have a childish perspective. I think he rose to his rank because people understand who he is enough to not be scared of what he would do. He reminds me of Bush.

Okay, preach on Petraus. I think the reason he pursued Clinton has to do with his deontic perspective on confidentiality. He can see classism here.  He's otherwise fairly blind on classist problem.

If he can't see political bias in his team, he's not looking for it.

I appreciate the Clinton investigation regardless. These are not easy moves. There were several significant FBI concerns at the time, IIRC. I'm sure this was not easy. I do think, however, that you are not being honest enough about the political influence of the investigation. Clinton was guilty, no doubt, but not easily prosecuted. I'm willing to set it aside as long as she lost her rights to the information.

I will say that Obama made several moves of integrity in this process. War criminal that he is, I admire some of his moves. Devil's Adocate, the reason he didn't want anyone to doubt the electoral process is directly because he wants to maintain the power of the elites.

Restarting the investigation makes sense, at least from this telling. Of course, I never had a problem with the investigation, but I wasn't going to vote for either of the pigs. 

This is definitely an FBI apology piece.

This is written from someone who takes detailed notes of his work and writes it to make him and the institutions he worships look as good as possible.

The Obama ball sucking could easily just be due to the fact that he likes those who have granted him power.

Truth in Domain names needs to wake up...that is not a good argument.

Judgment cannot be peeled apart from intelligence. 

The "we are not investigating you" thought process may be fabricated. It doesn't feel right.

He's very proud of his height (signal).

His laughing claim is ugly. His claim about only evil men running even worse. Ugh. =/

This fucker actually watches Fox. Let that sink in.

What disgusts me further about Comey's criticism of interference with US elections is his unwillingness (and lack of integrity) to point out how the US is just as guilty. This person is a disturbing nationalist. 

More diversity bullshit. If you cared about black people, you would do something about their material conditions.

Comey is clearly a politician. Just listen to his reasoning.

That firing was fucked up.

Yeah, he talks shit about Trump. He doesn't cast systematic doubt on the capitalist machine. For that, he is deeply responsible. 

No, it's not wrong to dismiss norms and traditions. You fucking conservative retard, go to hell.

You have no idea what is causing the problem. Your beliefs are illusions. 

Lol. The hope is hilarious.

I'm somehow surprised we went to war with Syria to distract from this book. It says nothing new.
