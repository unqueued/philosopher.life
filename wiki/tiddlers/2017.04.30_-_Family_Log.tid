!! How has your health been this week?

** Theory Coughing may be from the cat's fur!!
* j3d1h
** Allergies getting better. Officially starting puberty. Woot.

** Happy most of the time. Good. Got to play with his friends this week, but not as much as he would have liked. 
* j3d1h
** Mostly happy. The school schedule is okay, and she feels like she is still getting used to it. Haven't done much game-wise.

** It has been a crazy busy week. Finals weeks is always like that. Things will start to calm down soon. The lack of sleep is not helping.
