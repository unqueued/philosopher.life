title: 2018.02.20 - Retired: Structure of Moral Business

Pretend we had to work with other people in our business. How do we do it fairly and wisely?

Design a worker cooperative you can live with. Design a legally definable political/corporate structure which doesn't violate our moral principles. Let's make the clich√© mistake of trying to design a system ourselves. Obviously, great minds have tried and failed miserably. We can't expect to get it right. Think about it though. It's a legal theoretical construct, an advanced political and economic instrument. It's an old concept, but let's try to rebuild it from the ground up.

* Crystal clear by-laws with as much innate immunity to capitalist injections and corruptions as possible.
** Write a good constitution. 
** Our by-laws must "compile" to the American legal programming language, but we should write them in a higher level language.

* Means of production are owned by the citizens (the workers)

* Decentralized, minimal-trust, risk-averse power structures and ownership among users (the citizens, the workers)
** We hope economic efficiency and competitive advantages can arise from that protected chaos.

* Easy to use yet advanced democracy
** Forced voting
*** Some issues require votes that can't be proxied by representative. All others could be done by proxy (or proxy-chain).
** Wisdom of the crowds gets you simply average performance, but perhaps average is the best we can hope for.
*** Until we start hitting that singularity, AI driven political infrastructure (a double-edged sword if I ever saw one).
** Decentralized computing and information infrastructure, Blockchain legislative+judicial+executive docket, Game-theoretically correct voting procedures, and Voter-proxy representatives (and proxies for proxies, etc. which enables us to "federalize" to the extent voters themselves choose).
*** Security hardening (cryptographic proof being my favorite kind) is perhaps necessary. To what extent is unclear.
** Forced transparency all the way down
*** Whether or not to anonymize voting is the only serious exception possibility.
** Needs enforcement, which means it needs careful legal requirements.

* Doesn't legally own intellectual property unless it is completely copyfree
** We have to protect ourselves from Western legal systems while operating morally inside them.

* Duplicable and easily modified
** Make it viral. Make it easy to start hundreds of them. Starter-kits should be really simple and widely available.
** Open-source it. In way, or at least to some extent, we wish to subject it to science and public opinion.
** This is a blueprint that can easily be followed, duplicated, and modified.

How do we fire people?

* Vote them off the island.
** Someone has to be the boss. Maybe it should "collectively" be all of us. Rawls would adore this (if he understood it). We could always pay for a CEO, and if we were tired of him, we could dump him. It goes all the way to the bottom. 
** Remember that voter proxies allow this to scale very nicely. 
*** Users can have as much fine-grained control as they want.  
* We must compensate them for whatever stake in the cooperation they don't already possess (since they own the means of production).
** Clearly, this is non-trivial. 
** Their reinvestment funds don't count as theirs. How about that? Fuck this problem in the bud. If they leave or kicked, they just lose their reinvestment fund which is distributed evenly to everyone else. 
*** This is a huge disincentive to have a large fund, clearly. This is a huge incentive to spend your money. Perhaps this isn't acceptable.
*** Maybe we split it. They take half their reinvestment fund, and we keep the rest and distribute it. 

How we do hire and maintain citizens? 

* Must continuously pass psychopathy tests 
* Must continuously pass citizenship tests
* Must continually pass collective review
* The co-op must agree to allow people to join. It must be voted on. 

What do we pay people?

* Pay should automatically scale with inflation. Duh. No "Slip" here.
* We must pay competitive wages upfront. We have to participate in the labor market in a direct way. People can be payed what they worth in this sense. I agree that an expert should be paid more than a novice. I'm fine with letting the market dictate this price to some extent, as long as there is a living wage + mobility costs floor (a moral minimum wage) and perhaps a few other caveats. If that means we pay janitors incredibly well, then that's what we do. Janitors will do their absolute best if they are being paid so far above the market. 
** It's clear that we need a wage ceiling. Just because CEO's average X million dollars a year doesn't mean we should pay competitive wages for CEO's. 
* We must pay people with our profits equally. The Janitor has as much human worth as the CEO. Profits must be shared.
** We have to strike a balance between competitive wage and fair profit sharing, of course. It is just not obvious how best to do this. 

What do we do with the profits?

* Reinvest
** Force people to improve their means of production.
** They can save it in an account though, an account which can't be touched except for Reinvestment. 
* Split the rest

Owns the Means of Production

* People who don't own the means must either buy it or be given it. 
* The union could loan money to its member, but it would need to guaranteed not be usury.
** Interest rates should match the most accurate inflation rate. 
** I suppose that the costs of their loan can be explicitly taken from their profit-sharing as a form of debt-based reinvest. We're investing in our members.

Education

* We pay people to become educated. We have to fucking mean it too. 
* We should pay people to take free online courses. 
* This is a part of Reinvestment; these costs must be defrayed by the union at large. 

Socialization

* We pay people to meet together that aren't standard work. They aren't teambuilding exercises. They are trust-building exercises in a more practical and direct way. 

How do we deal with the fact that some people add more value to our products than others?

* Well, we pay competitive wages. There will be profits beyond that, but our reinvestment may take it all. 
* Pay could scale with how many dollars your department actually brings in.
** This makes it difficult with so many intangibles. Stopping redundancy is key to efficiency. 

Do we treat different departments/sectors of the organization as autonomous? 

* Is it like the Microsoft model, where each department is really its own business competing within the same umbrella company?
* How should we nest or have orders of co-ops inside of co-ops?
* Clearly, it would be good for autonomy's sake to be able to allow cells to divide, for one co-op to become two, to enable growth in that way, to scale appropriately. In a way, this is what voter proxying does for us. Once you are in the organization, you might have an easier time moving around too.


The immutable criterion of authority. Define it. 

Outsourcing

* How do we prevent the outsourcing of our labor? Abusing others by it. Keeping all the good jobs to ourselves and unloading the unprofitable ones to others. Milking them for their capital below what we would pay our own. I don't think this one is easily escaped. It's a classic problem. 


*Living Wages are minimum
** Dynamically generated by most accurate economic metrics

Should you be able to secede? How? Under what conditions?
