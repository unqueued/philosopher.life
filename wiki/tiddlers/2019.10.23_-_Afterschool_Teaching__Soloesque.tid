title: 2019.10.23 - Afterschool Teaching: Soloesque

Solo prep today. Inspection brought up a strike against the size of our pears (seriously, penalized for it, lol). Riiiiight. Uh huh. They are normal pears. I'm glad she brought up the poor condition of our veggies though. 

My 6th grade girls were in full giggle mode speaking with me today. I think they find my haircut ridiculous. It's true, a buzz haircut and a long beard look funny. 

6KM is back from her suspension. Constant lying still, borderline hopeless.

Carson isn't here today, and Whitney has decided she is going to spend time in the office instead. She took 15 kids and sat them in front of the office, and I took everyone else to a classroom to contain the chaos. Tons of homework today, so I'm doing my best to corral and encourage.

It's crazy loud in here, but I don' thave fires to put out today. I'm grateful. My students cluster into their usual groups. I push no boundaries now since I consider us to be in survival mode.
