* Hey, you have strong arms and you can breath. Go. Do it.
* Do her too, if you can.
* [[Transworld Identity]] is a huge fucking stake to put down.
** God damn, son! Go for it. You need it.

* Work =)
* Chops sound good. 
** Doing okay on the fruits and veggies thing. 
*** Your wife is kicking ass at it. You better toe the line, homie.
* Bob is somehow becoming a larger clusterfuck. It's hard to move away when you've gotten spoiled though:
** Chromium's superior add-ons
** Multi-device, multi-tab
*** It's so much easier for us all to use it when necessary.
