Hope you have a good day today. ^_^
THU 8:33 AM
You too =)
THU 10:37 AM
How many semesters do you have left, btw?
THU 10:37 AM
Two. This one included.
THU 10:38 AM
That is exciting. =)
THU 10:38 AM
For sure. Probably not going to take anything in the spring while I decide how to tackle getting my masters.
THU 10:40 AM
Or a program equivalent.
THU 10:40 AM
You'll want to apply for  your masters in the fall
THU 10:41 AM
or around next January
THU 10:42 AM
if it is an academic masters*
THU 10:42 AM
a professional degree/diploma mill will not require that
THU 10:42 AM
(although some do)
THU 10:42 AM
Thanks for the heads up. Our governor made things a bit more complicated because I don’t need a MIT necessarily anymore but I may still need an equivalent program or something....
THU 10:43 AM
I need to go talk to the edu department.
THU 10:43 AM
Ill likely just go ahead and get the masters because I think it will take me farther but I’d like to hear all my options.
THU 10:46 AM
It will improve your earnings potential. Government jobs tend to automatically scale like this.
THU 10:47 AM
You should get a masters in something. It became the new college degree a decade ago.
THU 10:47 AM
This might be a silly worry but I know finding a teaching job will be tough. I have a standing offer to teach at my old high school but I really don’t wanna teach in a Christian school.
THU 10:48 AM
I also feel that my other aspirations and lifestyle/ beliefs will become an issue for them if I work there.
THU 10:48 AM
I have several thoughts:
THU 10:51 AM
(1) You and [[L]] will need to decide if you are staying in KY. It may be wildly easier on the jobs front if you are willing to move. That is a significant problem for dealing with family.
THU 10:52 AM
(2) If you can become certified to teach mathematics, you should. In some cases, it may be as easy as passing a test.
THU 10:52 AM
You will struggle more with a subject like English than mathematics.
THU 10:53 AM
(I am not claiming that is a good thing in society)
THU 10:53 AM
(3) I strongly empathize with the lifestyle/belief differences problem. The fact is that I do not get to reveal who I am to almost anyone I work with.
THU 10:54 AM
There is a tendency for Capitalism to commodify you to the point that you can't hold a job if you are going to be yourself. This problem is (unjustly) going to exist for you in any position, but it will be exceptionally strong for teaching at a private Christian institution which you dismissing you simply because your sneeze sounded too gay.
THU 10:55 AM
LOL
THU 10:55 AM
To be fair you’re right...
THU 10:56 AM
(4) If your vocation is storytelling/writing, then look at your occupations as just that: a job. You can dispose of them. Teacher's make shit pay.
THU 10:57 AM
teachers* I 'll grammar right one day.
THU 10:57 AM
Is teaching your vocation?
THU 10:57 AM
I want 4, but people can write all of their lives and never get published. If I truly believed in my ability to tell stories and write, I would drop out of college right now and write a masterpiece. 

But I’m a realist, and if there’s a chance that my passion will amount to nothing then I need a plan to ensure that [[L]] and I can provide for ourselves and our future family. So I’m viewing teaching as a means to an end until the day comes where I do write something worthwhile. I’m vehemently pursuing writing as my passion career while simultaneously laying the foundation for the “what if” that I’m expecting.  

Hope for the best. Expect the worst
THU 11:01 AM
Prudent move. I agree to that.
THU 11:02 AM
Christian school will not like that my hair is long, that I curse and drink, that I watch R rated movies and cosplay. All of those things are who I am and I won’t stifle them or stop for a job.
THU 11:02 AM
A vocation is something you will pursue because it defines you, it is your purpose, it gives meaning to your life, and you would do it for free (or even at negative returns).
THU 11:02 AM
It is likely that will only be the tip of the icebergs of the problems you will face as you evolve and grow as a person.
THU 11:03 AM
Ah I didn’t understand the full meaning. Thanks for letting me know.
THU 11:03 AM
I suggest the differences will run much deeper than those surface issues.
THU 11:03 AM
For sure.
THU 11:08 AM
Our ideologies just don’t line up like they did back in high school and that will undoubtedly be the biggest issue.
THU 11:09 AM
It is the hardest problem I have ever faced.
THU 11:09 AM
(still facing it)
THU 11:09 AM
But for people like us, we can still be friendly and accepting of people with different views, but unless NHC has completely changed their stance on what they call core tenants on Christianity then I know it will be a problem.
THU 11:11 AM
So I’m not sure I *could* teach there.
THU 11:11 AM
I would be fired or not asked to come back. :sweat_smile:
THU 11:12 AM
aye
THU 11:12 AM
I'm talking about something much larger, btw.
THU 11:12 AM
[[The Existential Game]] itself.
THU 11:12 AM
This is one case example, a microcosm, a vignette.
THU 11:13 AM
Taught me two new words.
THU 11:13 AM
Thank you.
THU 11:13 AM
But i see what you mean. I can definitely empathize with your struggle.
THU 11:15 AM
I appreciate that. Thank you for reading my wiki, speaking with, and trying to understand me. I consider it an application of [[The Golden Rule]] (it is the [[Tit For Two Tat]] reasoning from a game-theoretic perspective).
THU 11:16 AM
Of course. It’s only fair. ;)
THU 11:16 AM
I check out every link you send me and I pop over to the wiki every once in awhile of my own volition.
THU 11:17 AM
Hope you have a great day.
FRI 8:50 AM
=)
FRI 8:50 AM
You too. You continue to initiate with me. I appreciate that.
FRI 8:50 AM
I’m trying haha. It only takes a moment to say “good morning” and it makes someone’s day. :)
FRI 8:51 AM
