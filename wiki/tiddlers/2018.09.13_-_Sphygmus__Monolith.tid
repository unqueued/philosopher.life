Dear Sphygmus,<<ref "d">>

<<<
Dear h0p3,

In this letter I'm managing my side of the conversation by dropping all the threads except one or two. Sitting on my responses until each one is completely ready doesn't seem right to me - rather, that would be letting my perfectionism and fear take over and get in the way.<<ref "dig">>
<<<

I appreciate your willingness to pick and choose the threads among my walls-of-text. I sometimes drown in perfectionism too. I assume you are like me and go back through the chain of correspondence to retell yourself the story. Threads that matter will eventually be answered (or re-answered). I'd like to think you are carving the salience by picking out the threads.

Wikis seem like the tools of perfectionists. It's a special space to be myself, to be messy, and to see myself + work progress. It makes imperfection, in a way, okay with me. 

I will probably ask it many times: what is your end goal (and subgoals?) with your wiki?

<<<
<<footnotes "dig" "Additionally I want to give each thread the time I need to really figure out what I have to say and how the words come together to convey it. My feelings are fast, but not my thoughts.">>
<<<

I know exactly what you mean! I fear I won't do it justice. Part of my concern with the legacy of the evolution of my wiki, proving how it has grown to myself again and again, has really boiled down to a form of self-encouragement and recognizing my [[fff]] limits. I never know what's really going to stick.

<<<
Let's start with the elephant in the room.

> Unless you are demonstrating something very leet to me, Light, I must warn you that you've likely revealed yourself through your domain registrar.

I felt a visceral, intense, physically emotional reaction to reading your drafts of [[Pop and Lock|2018.09.04 - Sphygmus: Pop and Lock]] and the edits to my entry in your wiki. My heart was pounding, and my chest was tight. I still felt that ringing in my chest when I started drafting this response, and I've gone through several layers of feelings as I continue to return to your words and mine.

A large part of my initial reaction came with feelings of betrayal and hurt that morphed into frustration with myself. <<ref "f">> <<ref "s">> <<ref "sp">> 
<<<

I often hate being so honest; it can be costly. I did not want to disappoint or hurt you. I am sorry for causing you anxiety. I talked to my wife about it before I could muster the courage. My stomach was knotted and that spot between my heart and armpit tightened and throbbed while I was writing and posting it.<<ref "anx">> Posting my wiki in general has been enormously anxiety inducing in a number of respects. It's interpersonal to me.

It may be something you think about for a while. You may eventually change your mind. I will listen carefully to you either way.

<<<
I'm not as leet as I imagine I am.
<<<

I'm not either, although I want to be! You know that though; you've seen my wiki. In just a couple weeks, you've accomplished things I haven't with a couple years (I may set the bar pretty low here). I assume your leetness will only continue to grow. 

<<<
<<footnotes "f" "after all of my thought and contemplation, I fucking doxxed myself because I was in a hurry and didn't want to lose the domain name (what were the chances of that tho, sheesh, my gut told me to slow down); because I was in a hurry, I didn't research why Namecheap wasn't showing WhoIsGuard for that particular domain; because I didn't research it, I didn't realize that self-doxxing was inherent to the .us TLD; and so, the consequences.">>
<<<

I did not know that about the .us TLD. 

Who do you aim to anonymize yourself against? What will you be releasing into the wild in the end?

<<<
<<footnotes "s" "I wasn't even planning on hosting content to sphygm.us from my current server, because I looked it up: you^^the general^^ can check the IP of one domain for other domains hosted there. See? I shoulda slowed down.">>
<<<

It's a hard problem. I will be interested to see where you go with it. In the end, I think neither of us will be able to stop a serious attacker. The vulnerability is quite unpleasant.

<<<
<<footnotes "sp" "actually, in a weird way I'm grateful you pointed it out. this explains why I've been getting a much larger volume of spam calls lately...">>
<<<

That is a problem I have not worked out for myself. I get robocalled pretty darn often (though it has been dying down as of late), and I have no idea what has caused it. 

<<<
The betrayal and hurt were projections, though. You have been honest about asymmetry, transparency, and the way you go about that in [[Gentle Clearnet Doxxing]]. I have privately questioned your implementation because I believe an argument could be made around curation: you gather together and present to your readers information that, while in the public domain, would otherwise have to be explicitly looked for.<<ref "EM">> Though obscurity-as-protection seems the obvious comeback.<<ref "fame">>
<<<

Thank you for so charitably wrestling with this. It is obvious you've put serious thought into it. I am indebted to you; I hope to repay your kindness. I know I could be wrong here; I'm doing the best I can with what I have.

I do not know if you wish to wrestle anymore with it.<<ref "sk">> You concede a great deal, but I aim to address what you've said because I want you to see I'm thinking about your thoughts!

Of course, I see merit in your question. Perhaps there is even a kind of slippery slope here too. If it took me 1500 hours to search for the information on the clearnet, then my search begins to look more insidious. In another direction, stylometry and metadata alone give you away to many adversaries (and the price of these attacks continues to fall); perhaps pointing to any identifying information on the internet or posting anything anyone ever writes to me would be a violation as well. At what point are we, as individuals, responsible for securing our privacy and anonymity? These are not issues I have the answer to, and perhaps that means I should not engage in my practice here. I am listening.

Currently, I try to employ [[The Categorical Imperative]] and harm-reduction consequentialist principles (which are necessary but insufficient  functions built into the CI) to draw a hedged line. Does centralizing this public information I gathered in minutes to model someone else legitimately increase the risks these people face? I'm not convinced of it. Does it increase the odds that I am able to more accurately model and connect with these people? Absolutely. I think the openness matters, and I've had to search for multiple ways to reach out to several people.

<<<
<<footnotes "EM" "I gather [[Eli Mellen]] was taking this point of view with the metaphor about pinning insects to boards and the bit about archiving.">>
<<<

~~It was definitely poetic (and so I could be quite wrong). Perhaps that is what he really means by it. I'm not so sure; there appear to be several interpretations, and I think the ambiguity is there by design (interlocutors have an obligation to be explicit in the dialectic). He entirely avoids what I said in his response, which is a redflag. I am not convinced he's charitably interested in the truth or a relationship (he could, but it's unobvious). My take from it is that he aims to sever further communication with a dismissive rhetorical device. I don't mean to stand in the nomad's way as he wanders the desert.~~

I am mistaken. While writing this draft, I received: [[2018.09.13 - Eli: Not A T42T Failure]]. I will need to think more. I'm keeping the strikethrough here because our conversation does not completely belong to us, to some [[dok]]. Of course, I want to understand your interpretation and feelings on the matter.

<<<
<<footnotes "fame" "You are curating, but in a document that is your personal horcrux. Is that significantly different from curation for the public eye? Would the fact that your wiki is a personal letter stop being an effective counter-argument if it suddenly became widely read?">>
<<<

This is an important footnote. Maybe it should be fleshed out more (I'm sorry if I've misunderstood it). It's personal, and it's interpersonal, but it's not private (or it's not intended to be). It is meant to be curated for myself and the public. I hope to make it clear what I'm thinking about.

I believe you are making a consequentialist argument. I don't think it should change if it became widely read, although I'm fairly convinced my wiki won't be widely read. Maybe I'm wrong though. I can't see that far. Depending on how widely read it became, when, by whom, and in what light, this could be a very dangerous thing. Few things can't be double-edged swords, including internet mobs. Admittedly, I believe I carry the vast majority of the risk here. 

Still, this is non-trivial question. What do you think?

Aside: I've been [[deepreading]] the Harry Potter series again, and I'm thinking it's like a hybrid horcrux-pensieve.

<<<
In many ways, I am scared of other people following the rabbit trails I've left through the internet because I am or have been a person who follows the trails of others. I cannot really justify my own actions to myself, though, because more often than not they stem from morbid curiosity. If I follow the trails of others out of curiosity and snooping fascination, why wouldn't someone else follow mine?
<<<

I hear that. That was my conviction too. I appreciate your willingness to voice it. Your argument demonstrates a great deal of integrity to me.<<ref "int">> 

One thing I'm trying to make clear is that we all form updating models of each other (and ourselves).<<ref "el">> Those models, of course, tend to be profoundly inaccurate and oversimplifying. Unfortunately, we also can't avoid the practice (it's the nature of our intelligence). I want to give people the opportunity to correct my model of them and see my integrity (or lack thereof) in thinking about them. I understand there is a difference between searching and posting one's search results too. Openness is difficult. I know I could be wrong about my method.

Do we strangers begin as adversaries when first meeting each other in the desert? How do we defeat the State of Nature? I think the majority of people really are ultimately going to fail to play the [[T42T]] Golden Rule game; they're fundamentally selfish and won't attempt to transcend it. I hope to rapidly demonstrate that I'm not your adversary through openness. It's really hard to build connections that matter (or maybe I'm just terrible at it?), and unfortunately, the people of the world might be running out of time to radically cooperate with each other. I think current approaches to this problem are clearly failing us. I feel like desperate times call for desperate measures.

<<<
You call me an artist several times throughout [[Pop and Lock|2018.09.04 - Sphygmus: Pop and Lock]], which I struggled with at first because I don't mentally use that word for myself.
<<<

I am surprised. I don't know what to think of that. It reminds me of some philosophy professors who refused to call themselves philosophers. They reserved the term for a special group of people they admired most. There is a modesty to that. Is this why you do not usually apply the label to yourself? Why are (or aren't) you an artist?

<<<
And yet, as someone who creates objects, I have started to feel some deep want to figure out how to be generous with or through those objects. When I'm making what I //really// want to make, deep in the act of creation, I'm not interested in whether or not someone likes it. I'm making it because I'm interested in making it.<<ref "ugh">>
<<<

Do you think you can find the crossover between "what you really want to make" and the deep desire to be generous through what you make? What will that look like? What does it do? Do you have to become someone different to achieve this?

Disclaimer: we are miles outside of my bailiwick here. I don't know even how to define [[Art]]; it's not something I've studied like you. I see my wiki as art, but I feel like a really shitty (though hardworking) artist most of the time. In any case, I hope to hear far more about your thoughts on this topic. I would also like a reading recommendation, if you are down for it.

<<<
<<footnotes "ugh" "It's so easy for others in my life to say 'why don't you make art in this style or that style?' I love them, but it's not that simple or reductive.">>
<<<

What do you think those others want for you and from you? 

I assume you aren't aiming for a particular style in your art, but instead something else. Is it a message? What is its purpose and meaning? What do you wish not to oversimplify or reduce? I cannot satisfactorily answer these ridiculously hard questions.

So, here's a worry: am I doing the same thing (or something similar enough) to you in asking you about your art? 

<<<
For example, I'm exploring the balance of negative and positive space through a combination of black, white, and textured areas in my current work-in-progress. I'm wrestling with this in particular because my piece is 18" by 24" and I usually work on 4" x 4" paper tiles. Transformation of scale is a huge issue here, no pun intended.
<<<

I would be interested to see it if and when you choose to reveal it.

I can appreciate the huge (lol) "transformation of scale" issue. It seems to me there aren't linear gains in what you can express when you scale up, but geometric emergences that are hard to predict. It's hard to see ahead and understand the differences in possibility. I feel really uncomfortable in those situations.

I miss those days when the unknown caused innocent curiosity where I dived into everything without anxiety. I didn't have an external goal to reach, in a sense, and so wandering and exploring didn't require vulnerability and the consequences I usually associate with failing to take the means to my ends.

<<<
Engaging in this dialogue with you feels like the first step towards being generous with the things I create. Sharing words in public is scary. Stepping out from the fog of detachment and invisibility into the real of connection and vulnerability is frightening. Somehow, though, that fear pales in comparison to the fear of sharing what I'm //really// interested in making with anyone at all.
<<<

I agree: it's scary! In a way, I'm having a hard time imagining something more scary. 

Please forgive me autistic tactlessness. Ignore my questions at will. Is it fair to say you consider your art to be an extension of yourself? Are you afraid people won't "get it"?<<ref "get">> Is a rejection of your art a rejection of you? Whose approval do you seek and why?  Do you fear the thing you are creating or strictly the sharing of it? 

Maybe you should only share it with some people. Will you continue to create art you might be too afraid to show anyone?

<<<
I'm afraid that this is pointless - I'm really, deeply scared that there is ''no point'' to [[Finding The Others]].<<ref "lk">> That I will travel through the pain of being vulnerable to find only nothing and emptiness. As the cliched quote goes, though, I would rather have tried and failed than to have never tried at all.
<<<

I am truly moved by these words. I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to even say it well enough. It's not just [[Finding The Others]] for me either. It's all my {[[Principles]]} (which are in absolute disarray). I desperately hope it's not pointless too. It's why I start with [[hope]]. It is my zeroth axiom.

Applying [[The Golden Rule]] is a leap of faith. I literally have no justification for it. I'm formally begging the question. I have no public reasons for it. Although I can attempt to coherentify the justification, I can never offer a foundation underneath it.

I have been burned so fucking hard by faith in my life. My brother [[JRE]] runs from it too. I have been suicidal many times over this issue. None of the meds worked (I ended up taking matters into my own hands), medical professionals literally couldn't see that faith would be that //integral// to anyone's identity, etc. Maybe I failed to communicate my feelings (I'm bad at it). I'm deeply scared there's no point too.<<ref "dd">> My {[[About]]} is all about that point. I have thrown myself into it with everything I have.

It is the leap. I do not know what your leap is or what it's like. The art of living is a profoundly lonely place at times.

I am reminded of [[The Fisher of Bones]] and [[The Nix]].<<ref "nix">>

I can't say I have the answers, but I have to try too! I appreciate your taking the risk to be my friend. I [[h0p3]] I don't fail you. I hope we find what we're looking for in the desert. I hope sharing the art that really matters to you (if and when you do) will turn out to be fruitful and painless choice.

<<<
<<footnotes "lk" "I really love that you have this transcluded linkage.">>
<<<

I'm considering moving to unilink to make it easier. I'm still undecided on it. Do you run into this problem?

<<<
Any ideas I have about where I'm going mechanically and structurally in my own wiki are currently gestating.
<<<

I am extremely interested to learn from you here. You are obviously competent and you come at this with fresh eyes. I am hoping you will see much further ahead than I can because I'm slogging through the same old swamp of structures I've built for myself. I'm wondering which mistakes of mine you avoid, what new things you come up with, and how your wiki fits your needs.

I don't mean to sound arrogant (too late!), but I can't find any good examples of what we are trying to do. If you run into any, please point me to them.

It seems many major wiki users I've seen are spinning up multiple wikis, one for each task. Do you think you will go this direction? What do you think of trying to unify these tasks?

<<<
 I've started using too many note-taking programs and then stopped using them after some amount of time, so my current focus is to build the habit of actually using my wiki. I'm taking a lot of school notes in it, drafting these letters, keeping a to-do list, sort-of daily logs/journaling, and so on.<<ref "o">>
<<<

A lot of people seem to start using a wiki and then it kind of drops off the map for them. I'm really trying to not let that happen to me.

Which tasks do you feel the wiki is a best in class tool for handling? What parts of your wiki do feel unhappy with?

Are you going to use any of the plugin tooling for to-do lists? 

<<<
<<footnotes "o" "I may be going at this completely ass-backwards. Perhaps I will regret not starting off with any structure. On the other hand, the most successfully reorganization attempt of my computer hard drive (inspired by the [[library of congress' personal archive advice|https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2016/05/how-to-begin-a-personal-archiving-project/]]) began with high level clumping of my huge # of existing files into 7 top level directories - and further clumping within those folders. I haven't touched most of what's inside the high level directories since my initial sort, but now I'm working within that structure so that any new files I create won't need to be reorganized later. My point being: I wasn't able to get that high level view without noticing the patterns in the individual content first. I'm sort of operating under that presumption here too.">>
<<<

That link has some good practical advice. I struggle with being pragmatic enough, especially when I want to get the theory all perfect (preoptimization is like a drug). Part of the problem, imho, is that because there is too much information and too many relationships, it becomes a marble slab (or a flatness). Which relationships are most salient for the sculpture I should cut from that marble slab (or rise from the flatness)? I can't say I'm good at this at all, and maybe it's common sense (somehow not common enough inside me)? It's still overwhelming.

<<<
Speaking of tags, I'm using them as the directory structure of my school notes. I use the "create tiddler here" to tag new class note entries, for example, and with a couple customized table of contents macros, they're automatically added to both the root tag tiddler and my sidebar listing. It's working pretty well for me.
<<<

That "create tiddler here" option is new to me. I didn't even know it was there, lol. Testing it out, it looks delicious.

I wish I could set the title, field, tagging, and body rules on an individual basis for that button. Say for [[Wiki Review]]. I'd love to have that button do the following:

* New Tiddler
** Title: YYYY.MM.DD - Wiki Review: PH
** Tags: YYYY.MM.DD, Wiki Review
** Body: javascript version of [[wikireview.py]] filling out the body

* [[Wiki Review]]
** Add `* [[YYYY.MM.DD - Wiki Review: PH` to //Focus://(Wiki Review)

This, of course, must be wrong-headed. Perhaps I'm trying to use TW in a way it wasn't designed to be used. Tagging is meant to take care of these problems. I've been told my method is fragile. I find this interesting because I feel like there's also an anti-fragile strength to hardlinking. I can read my wiki from the source code. I can port myself out of TW into a different tool if I need, and it's not obvious to me that automating the rendering of TW is actually going to make it more portable for me in the end (others seem so strongly convinced of it). My wiki is even largely operable even when it is statically served.

I could, of course, be entirely wrong. I am reluctant to have the state of tiddlers generated on the fly, although I desperately want the metadata and initialization to be automated. I never want my writing to be locked behind something which has to be strongly computed to show the results of my work. It does seem like I'm using the tool wrong.

I've grown fond of having metadata rich titles. I swear it makes reading through tiddlers easier. The title.Title ("PH" above) really do work for how I tell myself the stories of myself. Am I just wrong? Do you think I can could or should attempt to have my cake and eat it too?

<<<
From where I'm standing, you could tag all your wiki audit logs with "wiki audit" and have a macro pull that list into your Wiki Audit tiddler. Saves you from having to copy and paste the new link in. However...it would involve more fiddling around with tags and macros to get your monthly audit setup working...and who knows what else would come up. I'm not sure that tags actually provide you with any benefit.
<<<

Perhaps I need to just sit down and learn the in's and out's of TW to be in a position to judge if it is will be valuable enough to me to implement these. This may take a while, lol. It is still unclear to me how much I really benefit from tags as well, even after looking more deeply into it.

<<<
From my brief skim of that one Evernote article, a lot of it rings true to my personal experience.<<ref "tag">> It will be interesting to keep up with [[Tagging Theory]].
<<<

I think the points on search are spot on. Tagging's strength is not search. I'm not even convinced it's strength is in organization (which I think ultimately must be hierarchical; but I'm functionally telic in my epistemology and ontology). Tags do seem to connect lateral dots, improve memory mapping, and in the case of TW, enable a broad set of mechanics which titles and hardlinks are not meant to solve.

<<<
<<footnotes "tag" "Did I tag this topic using an uppercase letter or a lowercase letter? How many tags should I stick on this note? etc etc until it's just a pain in the ass that doesn't do anything better than hand-sorting or search can do.">>
<<<

That makes sense. Automated tagging and automation surrounding tagging is likely the most important thing. I do wonder, however, when sitting there thinking about what other tags should be there (without tagitis) benefits. Right now, I'm aiming to tag only the essential because I don't even know what it means to tag otherwise.

<<<
I'm definitely experimenting with different organizations and arrangements.
<<<

Awesome. I need to start doing this too.

<<<
Your last letter has almost become a free-form directory, with various sentences linked to new tiddlers where I'm drafting my responses. Perhaps they will become individual letters, or I'll consider selecting a certain number of tiddlers, exporting them as a static index.html, and hosting it on sphygm.us.<<ref "is">>
<<<

That is interesting. Forgive my spitballin'. I am so out of my element here. I hope you don't mind the mess.

I'm wondering if we should make use of bundles. Tell me what makes your life easier. 

As you have said before, merging wiki content is perhaps difficult at times, especially if they rely upon different programmatic mechanics (yet another reason to stick to hardcoded work, imho...). Outside of title considerations and footnotes (I'm probably forgetting something), any number of subsets of my wiki can be ported to another TW (I'd argue to a number of formats). It's just a bunch of links.

I have wondered for a while how I can (a) demonstrate your authorship more effectively in this wiki (I fear I do not do you justice here), and (b) perhaps enable you to create larger spaces in your responses. I have no idea if these are good ideas. I have a tendency to flatten hierarchies (e.g. [[2018.09.07 - kickscondor: Nothing is Personal]]) in many cases. Exactly how exporting and importing tiddlers between wikis is not something I fully appreciate yet.

Multi-authorship brings me to another kind of related problem even in my own work where I wish that I could have lots of nested links/references:

`[This is ((my {foobar} senten''ce), and {it}) //has lo''ts of ({overlapping} and {nes//ted}) links]`

There may not be a solid way to represent all that information, I'm afraid. I know my brother JRE wishes I had something like this since some of my sentences require some serious parsing and definitions that I need to point to internally and externally. I'm about 99% sure there is something deeply wrong with my thinking here, so go ahead and point it out.

Perhaps having overlapping/nested linking would allow you to impose your free-form dictionary/reference choices on top of mine. Maybe I could "turn on" Sphygmus' overlapping linking visuals? The other option is to go for redundancy, especially since it gives you the ability to reshape the content into the proper representation; this is the easier and more portable option too.

<<<
<<footnotes "is" "...hosting issues aside. or maybe I'll just shrug and host it on the same box I'm using now, IP domain back-tracing be damned.">>
<<<

To some extent, I've tried to let go of related problems like this myself. I probably have a billion opsec nono's. When you join my resilio sync (a piece of proprietary software that I'm shocked isn't used everywhere), you are literally connecting to [[monster-10]] and a number of my machines (all of my external boxes too). If someone really wants to pwn me, they are going to succeed.

<<<
I've also started to remix your structures - I'm trying to really embrace the "big tiddler made with lots of little tiddlers" concept, so I made a macro that emulates your directory template. My topic tiddlers have nothing in them except a `<<directoryTemplate>>` macro call. Within this macro, each area (Focus, Principles, etc.) is its own tiddler. For example, `$(currentTiddler)$: Focus`. In my macro, the headings are links to the sub-tiddlers, and below the headings are the transcluded contents of those tidddlers. I'm not sure if it's //really// the best way to go, but I was curious enough to try and build it. Let me know if you'd like the full macro code, too.
<<<

Of course ''I want to see''! If it is not too painful, would you send me a plain wiki with the mechanics in them so I can see them come alive and inspect them? That may be far too much work (and please do not spend a moment more time than you wish). I'm lucky to even be able to talk with you about this issue. 

Have you ever played a game that no one else you know plays? And then you meet a random person who also plays that game, you geek out, etc.? That's kind of this for me. It's exciting.

I must warn you that I've lived in this zoo for so long that I don't rightly know how badly it smells. While I hope I've built my structures well, I hope you find a better way than I have. It's likely you will find a much better approach (especially to your own context), and I hope I have the integrity to listen and think carefully about it (I'm easily stuck in my own ways).

I'm woefully ignorant here. I feel like I'm making it up as I go along, and you have a different map. Where's the oasis in the desert on your map?! Do you have a shortcut? Oh, my map is drawn in the wrong ink. Look, you have special symbols on your map that let us open the door over there.

<<<
Just continue emailing me your response's direct link, I think. I can always get the wikiText from your site when I want to paste it into mine. I do really like the idea of us keeping two sets of books - it seems friendly and honest and like a direct commitment to the process of communication. And I love Sublime Text's multi-select find&replace, so hand-grafting is essentially trivial.
<<<

Good. Let me know if you need a key (for 2) or a crack (for 3).

<<<
That's all for now!

cheers,
sphygmus

ps. yes, I'm doing nightly backups! that was one of the first things I set up before transferring my local node.js files to my remote server. (more specifics on the reasoning for my wiki setup later.)
<<<

I have been capitalizing your name out of habit. Do you prefer Sphygmus or sphygmus?

<<<
Hey h0p3,

Just a quick<<ref "ha!">> note because my wiki is rapidly shifting around and you said you're interested in my observations!
<<<

Indeed, I am interested. I think it's a good idea that you are rapidly shifting too. Once it starts to crystallize, the habit becomes hard to change.

<<<
<<footnotes "ha!" "Well, I intended for it to be short when I started writing, but then it got out of hand...">>
<<<

=) I know that feel. It's all good. That's half the point, imho.

<<<
I ditched the directoryTemplate macro idea - it was interesting, but added 2 or 3 extra clicks whenever I wanted to edit a section. Not worth those clicks for me right now, but I'm keeping the code around in case I need to come back to it.
<<<

That makes sense. I would still like to see it, if you are down for it. 

Imho, the automation should limit friction and handwork. Those clicks are going to add up when you are exploding and can't get it out onto your wiki fast enough. They are speedbumps worth destroying if you can (to some extent, I have failed in this respect).

<<<
Your filter lists question on the TW Google Groups has been fruitful for my experimentation - instead of hardlinking in my `Focus` areas (the only section I'm really using at the current moment), I'm building list-links based on title searches. Although, as I'm drafting this letter, I think I'm going to switch to tag-based link-lists in my `Find The Others` directory, because the "new tiddler here" button has really proven to be convenient for me.
<<<

{[[Focus]]} is the only section I consistently use as well. It is a cause for concern with me. {[[Vault]]} is a place I've barely touched, and if something is important enough to me, it doesn't belong in {[[Dreams]]}. Perhaps in time they will eventually be filled out. {[[Focus]]} has a ton of clumping and re-arrangement in it. {[[Focus]]} is the heart of the wiki in a way (although, it is not the goal for me). I'm still growing the place, and I'm not sure how I'm going to transplant stuff yet.

In the end, my [[Wiki: Fundamental Epistemic Structure]] may be poorly constructed, especially for you. I hope you explore more semantic structure possibilities. I will be interested to see where you go. It took me a long time to figure out what stacks were even working for me. It was just a heap before.

I would love to see how you are doing both kind of list-links. The "New tiddler here" feature is sweet. 

<<<
I have one (1!) ''serious'' concern about using list-links and similar to auto-build the content of our directories, regardless of whether the filter is built on title searches or tags. __Tiddlers linked from the list-links macro are counted as orphans.__ Not sure if you use the `Orphans` tab under `More`, but there's...around 24 orphans in your //entire// wiki. In my wiki? Sooo many more. I really want to be able to use that tab as a tool to see what I have missed, what I haven't made a place for - but that's basically impossible when using list-link macros. I have no idea if there's a reason for TiddlyWiki working this way - I assume so? - but haven't looked into it.
<<<

=) The orphans were what pushed me to hardlink. I realized that it was getting out of control and I needed to start clumping something, anything together. I didn't know what it should look like, so I just started linking. I'd say my process has been "organic," but that makes it sound lot better than it is; it's really been about trying to bring order to the chaos. I've not gone through those orphans (most of which are garbage) in a long time. Going through that list, I am reminded of how naked I feel with this wiki.

You are doing this so much more intelligently than I did. I'm looking back at my process and feel like an idiot, lol.

<<<
I'm super excited about the potential for my wiki to provide context for external links in ways that bookmarks really fail at. My `Useful Utilities` tiddler has quickly become a frequent reference of mine.
<<<

If you are willing, I would be interested to see how your "Useful Utilities" page is setup. This is a problem that I have no idea how to solve nicely, and it keeps popping up. I like having the flexibility to grow various projects however I need to, but I also don't have a lot of cookiecutter solutions to try first. Modeling is not my strong-suit in many cases.

<<<
I'm starting to get addicted - I upgraded my serverbox's Debian & package installs yesterday, and that broke my wiki services though I didn't find out until this morning. It was surprisingly frustrating to realize I didn't have access to my writing-things-down-place when I really needed it!!
<<<

Lol, xD, I know that addiction. It has shaped a lot of things in my life; even my computing infrastructure and OSes have been bent to meet the needs of my wiki. Getting caught with my pants down being unable to access or change my wiki sucks! On many occasions when something went wrong, I've had to just use a text editor and graft it in later. 

<<<
The ''biggest'' issue I had to solve before TiddlyWiki could work for me was accessibility, and it was 100% worth the time to struggle through and figure out how to host the node.js version on my own DigitalOcean droplet. Now I log in and edit from my phone, my Chromebook, my desktop, school computers, work computers, a borrowed laptop - and it works beautifully across each and every one of them.
<<<

I totally get that. I tried nodejs, and I've thought many times about using it again. It has wonderful properties. 

Unfortunately, Tennessee has unreliable infrastructure, and I take it to be a fact of life that I will lack internet access (even 4G) at times. I simply can't accept remoting in, even to my own house, because I just don't always have access. This is a huge strike against nodejs for me, and this is part of why I use Resilio Sync and platform specific tools to open the wiki. That frustration of not having access to my "writing-things-down-place" is very problematic to me. This has been the most consistent method for me.

Perhaps I could run multiple nodejs installations and sync the .tid files. You won't catch me traveling more than a mile from my house without my modded chromebook except when I go shopping. I don't visit anywhere without my phone and chromebook (autism and computer addiction alert). So I could run it on multiple devices. 

Another problem is that I sign my wiki in {[[Verify]]}. I'm not leaving my private key on a remote server, so it has to be at home. It matters to me. 

Of course, I can divide what I serve to others and what I use to edit (that's what I did for a while in nodejs). There are times when I am having real-time conversations with people over my wiki. I could just compile every X minutes and on an "as needed basis", but often I don't have the cognitive capacity to juggle it (meh, I could script and hotkey that). Automating the process is necessary for my sanity. It is computationally expensive to recompile the wiki into the index.html file every minute (even for [[monster-10]]); I have no idea why it's so absurdly expensive.

The full .html file is robust. I can dispose of them, rollback instantly, backup with a thousand tools, and serve without npm installed on any number of networks. Some of the things I have to say in this wiki would get my killed in many countries. There may come a day where decentralization is the only method I can serve my wiki. I want to build that infrastructure; I consider it my duty.

It's super ugly getting other tools to interact with TW without nodejs though. I may be forced no matter what. I despise writing in my wiki on anything but my desktop. Just running node on my desktop just isn't that problematic. I've solved my ISP's NATing through a couple options as well (so I can remote through their destruction of net neutrality too).

With nodejs, keeping the hardlink structure seems pretty easy. Automatically generating my daily core requirements and throwing the hardlinks into the directories won't be a problem (this was one of the reasons I went for nodejs the first time). I believe the wiki can also be used to activate local software, so it may a lot of interesting things can be done on that front.

Have you found a way to update what is rendered in the browser after changing .tid files (I believe there are some race/overwrite worries)? 

What do you think I should do? 

<<<
The vanilla theme is horribly outdated when it comes to responsive web design and mobile usage<<ref "css">>, so I more-or-less completely wrote my own theme using flexbox (<3). The vast majority of that work makes my wiki feel good to me across the gamut of screen sizes I'm encountering because of the wide range of displays I use it on. The bones of the CSS have been solid for at least two weeks now, but I'm still tweaking the little things. (Font sizes, screen size breakpoints, font styles, etc.)
<<<

That is awesome. You must think my choices are pretty awful here, lol. I've designed my wiki to be productive on my screen, but that's it. It looks like shit on a lot of other screens (though, still operational). Maybe I need to change that.

How much more responsive is your wiki than vanilla? TW is not instant on my screen, and perhaps it would be worth improving on this front, especially for BurningTreeC's keyboard plugin (which adds yet another layer of latency).

When you have it fairly settled, would you mind sending me a stripped down copy of visuals of TW to look at? Rip out the guts and show me the shell. I'd like to get a feel for the differences compared to vanilla.

<<<
<<footnotes "css" "I am very opinionated about this. Specific pixel widths? Absolute positioning? Augh! (I make great use of percentages and em values in my CSS theme, though I am far from perfect as a web developer.)">>
<<<

Ha. I can appreciate that. My wiki is exceptionally poor in this regard, but I think TW in general has a problem. Admittedly, I'm surprised you write in it at all on your phone. The experience for me is very poor. You must have done something really cool.

<<<
You probably haven't encountered this, but for some reason my wiki //hates// tiddler titles with question marks. I don't know why and it's bugging the everloving fuck out of me. I make a tiddler with a question mark in the title, save it, do some stuff, and now there's two tiddlers in my `New` tab - one without the question mark and one with. Upon reloading the wiki webpage, the tiddler with the question mark in the title disappears from existence entirely. somehow ''one single tiddler'' remains in my wiki with a question mark in the title - why does that one stay??? Augh! Probably a question for the Google Group Gurus.

Cheers!!

I haven't seen that behavior before. I can't seem to replicate it either. That is disconcerting. Is it possible to lose work with this? 

<<<
Take all the time you need to digest! Shit's complex, yo.
<<<

Thank you!<<ref "res">> I love that you said "yo." =)

<<<
The whole "un-hardlinked tiddlers showing up in the Orphans tab" issue was bugging the heck out of me today. I installed the [[tiddler link auto-complete plugin|http://snowgoon88.github.io/TW5-extendedit/]]<<ref "LL">> and then went through and hard-linked everything. Autocomplete really made that process faster/better, since I was mostly starting from scratch. Good thing going forward? Who knows. I need to stop fiddling with the structure and get back to putting in content.
<<<

That plugin is cool. I tried it out. It doesn't do anything valuable for me. I'm a huge fan of autocompletion on the commandline, but it doesn't have that magic spark for me here (and it should be immediately obvious in my experience). I either have the tiddler's name memorized (most of the time), or I have to look it up through my directories or search. Part of the problem is that I have so many tiddlers that it overwhelms that tool.

If it continues to show its value to you though, let me know. I try to minimize how many plugins I use for performance and size reasons (I'm like a kid in a candy shop otherwise), so I may not have given it enough time to grow on me.

<<<
<<footnotes "LL" "you mention it in [[2018.09.07 - Wiki Audit: Filterlists|https://philosopher.life/#2018.09.07%20--%20Wiki%20Audit%3A%20Filterlists]]">>
<<<

I still haven't even touched [[Filters]] yet. I need to make decisions about whether or not I'm going to move beyond a bucket of links. 

<<<
(You've got me started scratching my head over tags - there were some things I instantly gravitated towards using them for in my wiki<<ref "eg">>, but now I'm like, "hrm.")
<<<

It sounds like we are both going to need some time to figure this one out.

<<<
<<footnotes "eg" "collecting poems: I put the author into a field, and then use a table of contents (?) macro that I edited to also show the author, so the tag page itself is a list of the poem titles with the authors. That's instead of the default TOC which is just bullet-ed links.">>
<<<

This sounds like a great use of tagging in TW. I like tags for archiving someone else's materials. I think it requires individuating/atomizing the content per tiddler. The poetry collection makes good sense, but once you get to larger sizes, it's like the wiki is a file explorer layer sitting on top of non-embedded content. I'm not sure it's the best tool for the job though. For a [[Music: Library]] that wants to tag every song, my gut instinct is to use software designed for it. Perhaps I'm wrong though; TW is very flexible.

I really wish there were solid public examples. These horcrux-pensieves don't seem to be things people are likely to share most of the time.

<<<
Found a couple links - I haven't yet sat down and read them, only skimmed, but I thought they might be of interest.
<<<

Thank you for these excellent links. I've been thinking about them here: [[2018.09.12 - Tagging: Think]]. I'm undecided.

<<<
[[Better to Organize...by Folders Or by Tags?|https://rdcu.be/6ww0]] : Obviously your hardlink directory structures represent the folders in this case.
<<<

I hear ya. The one file, one folder correspondence issue is a big a difference. I am convinced that linking structures, wherein the same link can be used multiple times in different directories, allows one to build logically equivalent semantic structures of tags (just as tags really are directories, and multiple tags are directories with multiple links). TW is simply designed for tagging to be automated in cases where titles are not; that is a big practical difference.

<<<
[[The Effect of Folder Structure on Personal File Navigation|http://muse.tau.ac.il/publications/101.pdf]] (PDF warning) : Less specifically about tags vs. folders, but a broader look at digital file retrieval.

[[Better file organization around tags, not hierarchies|https://www.nayuki.io/page/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies]] : This person seems to be strongly opinionated towards tags; perhaps this article will give a better insight into how someone who prefers them thinks about them?
<<<

Thank you for the articles. I definitely have strong feelings about them, but I've not resolved the problem yet. I'll be interested to think about your findings.

<<<
Make this a new tiddler or put it under Wiki Musings, as you like!
<<<

Thank you. If you don't mind me asking, which would you do?

Alright, that is a long letter (even for me!). I'm going to continue to think about this.

Sincerely,
