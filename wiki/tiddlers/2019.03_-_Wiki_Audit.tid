!! Audit:

* I didn't do it everyday. =/
* Lots of ideas and {[[dreams]]} in here.
* Bob continues to kill me, and yet, I'm addicted.
** I'm so torn on it. There's nothing else like it. I bend over backwards for this piece of shit. I hate nodejs. I hate running a server.
*** I really should attempt to move to a git model if I can. Performance is king. I'm paying a ridiculous tax to this tyrant.
** So many things don't work nicely in anything except singlefile.
* Commander hasn't worked perfectly, but it works well. I'm glad we can start to carve this turkey up.
* Serious turnover in plugins. 
** I'm still hoping TW5-Nav will come alive again. We may try again later.
* It's official, 5.1.19 was a complete bust.
** Gonna sound entitled and skeptical here: will there be an upgrade that matters again?
* [[j3d1h]]'s labor is so obvious in this machine. It's a complex thing for a 13yo to understand let alone build. Give her a couple more years, and she will know more than I do about computing in almost all cases.
** I don't know what the next step for her needs to be. I think the social end is probably the most important thing. She needs to study people, practice, etc.
* I'm still open to the possibility that I'm going to be editing in nvim/spacemacs. This may become a dumber tool in the end.
** I really don't want to do that. I'm still convinced there is something special about sharing a pilot's seat between the reader and writer. 
* [[The Remodeling]] is back, and it is slower than ever. Bob is too fucking slow. 
** What if we made a tool that opens singlefile, extracts a date range out of recent, and then inserts it. I can then edit arbitrary singlefiles and merge them. 
*** Git seems like only sensible option.
*** The kids need to feel comfortable with git.
* I've seen a new plugin set that looks like it attempts to have virtual story rivers. This seems like it could be stripped down to something extremely simple. [[Open]] should be souped up with it.
* One interesting thing is that I'm convinced this should be VMed regardless of the methodology used. It is likely a bunch of tools which should be combined together. 
* I can't get over the "neuron" signal strength claim. There really may be something there.
** Except, I have no intention of being that explicit. It's already work just trying to put solid tags on these fucking tiddlers.
* The wiki and [[RGM]] continue to evolve at a brisk pace for me.
** It's probably absurdly glacial to someone who knows what they are doing. I am a slow learner.
