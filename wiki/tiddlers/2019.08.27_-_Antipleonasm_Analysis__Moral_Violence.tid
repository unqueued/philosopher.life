title: 2019.08.27 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Moral Violence

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
When the rich rob the poor, it's called business; when the poor fight back, it's called violence.
<<<

The double standard is nested, and I generally find this form of the dialectical slave/master relationship extends into all realms of the unjustified will to [[power]]. 

We face [[memetic warfare]] and imagecrafting.<<ref "i">> Do not buy the gaslitic memes which capitalists and reactionaries are selling you, a choice they will continue to make as the chains of contradictions in capitalism materialize. 

If a wealthy person speaks to you, you are epistemically justified in assuming they are lying to you and to themselves. Never forget: [[good]] people cannot be wealthy for long when there are so many poor people. Of course, even the wealthy do not think they are wealthy. It doesn't matter how rich they are, they will spin you a tale. 

Violence is sometimes morally obligated. Prepare yourselves.
