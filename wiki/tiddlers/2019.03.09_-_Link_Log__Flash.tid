* Stunning!
** http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/treemap/country_exports/all/all/-4000/2010/H15/pantheon
*** Wow. That's awesome. There is a semblance of [[The Great Human Conversation]]. Not often a tool is up in stunning.
*** I am, of course, a huge fan of the 4 Saints at the top of that list, rofl.

*** I'm going to cry; I don't feel alone anymore.

*** Energy efficiency of increasingly "accurate" (not surprised) predictive coding, habituating our [[fastmind]] to see the world a particular way, crystallizing our algorithmic identities.
**** Note, of course, the difference between description and prescription.

*** I cannot wait for completely ML generated music to rule. Saw some Bach hacks before. It's going to generalize. Talk about my kind of treadmill!
** https://medium.com/coffee-and-junk/cognitive-bias-outcome-bias-738ab4dc8f20
*** Sounds Bayesian.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://spiritleveldelusion.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-spirit-level-ten-years-on.html
*** I have not seen this response before. Huh. Damnit.

* Think About It
** https://politicalanimalmagazine.com/the-beauty-of-being-wrong/
*** Love the paranoia, and it's an important integrity move.
** https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/01/12/the-maturing-of-the-smartphone-industry-is-cause-for-celebration
*** I think planned obsolescence is inevitable. Apple is not going to win the GAI/ML game, but they have an addictive cloud and plenty of cool factor. Perhaps they will innovate. They have the data, but they don't have the hardware specialization yet. They can buy their way out of this.

*** Gorgeous. I have lots of opinions on how to maximize digital anonymity here, but physical logistics will always be a weakpoint. I suggest the automation of state and private physical surveillance is going to skyrocket. The U.S. military already employs it against the "evil empires" abroad. Paramilitarization of police and private opportunities to conduct the illegal contract work as oracles will be very hard to defeat. I don't see how that material dialectic armsrace can be won.

*** I think they choose to learn from those they like. That's different.

* Fishy
** https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/03/decline-men-without-degrees-labor-market/584479/
*** Uh, lol. Take a good look at Marx again. Be radically more doubtful about how unemployment is measured. Look at real earnings and cost of living. Look at the drug-escape epidemic.

*** I'm a huge fan of his socialism.
*** No GÃ¶del or Von Neumann there, puh-lease.
*** Stephen Pinker is magically on the list (surpise!); he is a convenient skeptic turned dark-triadic egoist reactionary. Wrong blackbox basket, dipshit.
*** Your lack of philosophers on that list is disturbing and hypocritical. Look at the IQs of professional philosophers; they are competing with mathematicians and physicists.

*** Yikes. Seems pretty obvious that even for making our world less predictable, destroying huge amounts of capital, requiring massive reactions, migration, and food/water supply differences are going to wreak havoc. It's Libertarian slavery. Still an existential crisis, kiddos.

*** Bible as "content-rich lifestyle brand." WOW. My mind is blown.

*** A form of domestication.
