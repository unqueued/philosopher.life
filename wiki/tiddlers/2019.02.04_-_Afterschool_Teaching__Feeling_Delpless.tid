title: 2019.02.04 - Afterschool Teaching: Feeling Delpless

Delp is sick, and I'm told he will likely be out for the week. That dude cannot catch a break. Mitchell is taking his place in the office, and Matt won't be here until maybe 4ish. Whitney is feeling anxious because we have a large group today, and she doesn't feel comfortable handling the older kids. I said I'm happy to take whatever makes her life easier.

The older kids actually did homework and reading, which apparently is rare, cruel and unusual compared to matt. I helped some students who accepted my help. Most just wanted to talk. Matt eventually came, and I handed them off to him. I continue to volunteer to take kids to the lab. Apparently, they tried doing everything together instead of giving the kids an option, and that is still sinking in.

I can tell Baines finds me an odd character and reasonably so. 

Father-figureless 8Cf has followed me around today seeking attention. I have answered her questions as thoroughly as I can. She has no interest in what I actually have to say, lol. We started doing some philosophy, and she dropped off the map. I tried helping her with her math, but she had no interest in listening either.
