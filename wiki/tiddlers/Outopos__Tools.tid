title: Outopos: Tools

!! Yes, please:

* [[Imunes|http://imunes.net/]] - Integrated Multiprotocol Network Emulator/Simulator
** Here we test Outopos. This is how we simulate networks. I think we should build the toolkit inside a VM so we can run it on any machine. 



!! Features I want in Outopos

* https://github.com/zehome/MLVPN - Multi-Line Bonding VPN
* https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole
* https://github.com/zboxfs/zbox


!! I don't know:

* Maximizing network quality/error correction:
** https://github.com/wangyu-/UDPspeeder

* Distributed Search
** https://github.com/go-ego/riot
*** But, I also want Bayesian improvements. I want deep learning to be at the core. I want us to be able to try different distributed/decentralized search methods and let Survival of the Fittest (non-monetized) take over.

* The Network Stack

* Building Molecular Trust from Atoms

*** "There is value in mapping these relationships. Trust enables lowering the cost of transacting. Low cost of transacting enables creation of powerful ecosystems. It's the first proposal that I am aware of that introduces an economic incentive on an individual level for mapping trust. The system seems potentially very robust: 1) I add people I trust in order to increase the value of my coins 2) If I make a mistake and add an actor who turned out to be untrustworthy I am penalized by losing some value from my coins. Thanks to this dynamic, there is both an incentive to expand the network and eliminate bad actors on an individual level."
**** This is the trust-based filtering we need in [[Outopos]].

* Terminal Tools
** Surviving Connecting Problems
*** Mosh
*** Eternal Terminal
