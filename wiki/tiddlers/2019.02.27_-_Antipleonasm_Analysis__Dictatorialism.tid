I agree that capitalism is highly symbolic of contemporary America. Businesspersons subject to no other authority beyond their own are dictators or oligarchs. She wants economic power centralization above all else. On her view, making money isn't political: it's just business. Of course, I think capitalism is enforced by armed thugs, corrupted bureaucrats, and the invisible hand which guides our current government.
