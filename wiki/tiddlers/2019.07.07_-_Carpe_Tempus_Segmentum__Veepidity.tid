title: 2019.07.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Veepidity

* Woke at 10
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Wandered and talked with myself and imaginary minds.
** I'm glad I can't literally hear.
* Read+Write
* Chilled with my wife on the couch
* Veep
* Family Time!
** Lots of hiccups, but it smoothed out. 
* Veep, wine: both amazing for my mental health. I'm very stable!
* Omg, a taco bell run. Noice!
* Fell asleep at 8. Lol.
** A belly full of the cheapest wine per unit of alcohol, TBCheese, and what they refer to as "protein" because it legally cannot be referred to as meat slays my consciousness. I dreamed and dreamed. 
* Woke at 10:30.
* My wine-supercharged taco bell farts are amazing. They are unstoppable.
** I am betting $10 right now that when my wife comes down in the morning, she is going to know immediately. If she reads this before, I might not have the chance to deliver my shit-eating grin from ear to ear.
*** I'm worried the smell is going to permeate the house enough that she will come down to complain. I've farted in the hallway before (not loudly), and the smell of death woke her up. Her nose is legendary, my farts mythical. 
*** Just remember, my love: even toothbrushes in their original packaging in a bathroom grow the bacteria which emit for everyone's buttholes (amazing Petri dishes), and we are in fact tasting my aerosolized digestion. 
* Read+Write+Watch(Veep)
** Second screen goes so nicely. It's right in my peripheral.
