title: 2019.07.06 - Prompted Introspection: Someone Famous

!! If you could spend a day with someone famous, who would it be?

Oh, Lady Melisandre, my answer will be...`/Michael-Scott-Drumroll`...whoever maximizes the global utility equation upon having spent a day with me (I'm going to guess that is no one!). Outside of doing the [[Right]] thing, or considering how a single meetup could change lives longterm, I would very much like to meet you dressed up in costume, Mz. CVH. It would be an amazing day. Thank you for yet another pointless exercise, my dear.
