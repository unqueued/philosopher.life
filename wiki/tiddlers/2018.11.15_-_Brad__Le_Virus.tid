Oh, I know. As I said, I think only an executable you had already downloaded would be capable of that damage. I don't think I had anything to do with it.
12 HR AGO
And, I know you don't think that I'm responsible either.
12 HR AGO
Anyway, how's your day going?
11 HR AGO
No I know for a fact that you are not responsible for it

Very cool
8 HR AGO
Not really we are doing some tradeing and he doesn't know how to install a motherboard I'm not getting paid for it just trying to be nice
8 HR AGO
ah
8 HR AGO
He's tradeing me a Intel i7 960 and a motherboard and a gtx 1050ti for a water cooler and a amd cpu and some case fans but I think that that i7 is a little too old to sell
8 HR AGO
It's not great, but I think someone surfing the web will be fine with it
7 HR AGO
I really only want the 1050ti I don't care about the cpu and mobo I don't know which would be better to run in my amd system the 970's in sli or the 1050ti I'll have to research it but you can have whichever one I don't use for your kids pc if you want it or them

Your 970s clocked in at about ~7k on that benchmark. I think the 970 is better.
7 HR AGO
Were you able to find out the stats on the i9 computer?
7 HR AGO
No not yet you are going to have to remind me and I will go up there and do it or you can just come by and check it out yourself
7 HR AGO
