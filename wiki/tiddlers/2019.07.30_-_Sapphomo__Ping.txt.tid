[11:53 PM] h0p3: Thinking of you. :smiley:
[11:53 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#2019.01.29%20-%20Sapphomo%3A%20Taking%20Forever%2C%20Sorry
[11:55 PM] Sapphomo: DAWWWW SHUCKS this is so lovely! i cant wait to read; im in the midst of studying. i was bummed our convo petered out but ALAS, it was only brewing :smiley:
[11:56 PM] h0p3: Ha, ttyl then. Study away. I didn't know if you saw it or not, so I thought I'd shoot you a message a few months later. I try to give enormous space (some of my letters take me a couple months to write).
[11:56 PM] Sapphomo: so wild to see how my infosecronomicom vision has changed since then, but also you were someone i rambled to in the beginning :smiley:
[11:56 PM] Sapphomo: ah i understand
[11:56 PM] Sapphomo: my gmail inbox fills up with letters i intend to respond to and then i get lost for hours responding to dear friends
[11:56 PM] Sapphomo: like, months later
[12:07 AM] h0p3: (I'm interrupting your studying, but I want to know more about infosecronomicom, whenever you get the time. I've always found it a fun topic, even if I'm not skilled. Anyway, ttyl, take all the time you need.)
[1:02 AM] Sapphomo: oh i dont mind a blabber break! i still need to read your lovely post, but: scope creep was a problem in TiddlyWiki, i had a few iterations of structural re-arrangement and ideas for what should be in there. i wanted to have habit-tracking via magickal sigil development, spaced repetition flashcard review, as well as all of the tutorials for the various tools. 

I spent some time on the technical pieces which i still have to rewrite to fit the story now, but eventually about a month or two ago i stumbled upon the open source non-linear narrative development program Twine. there are some BEAUTIFUL, excellent, creative stories devised with it and i just fell in love with just sticking to story as much as possible -- i'll be able to include some of the other things in other formats or other apps, it doesn't need to be all in one. and some stuff i can creatively insert into the story :smiley: so about a month back i set a writing goal of 250 words/day... i'm hitting that about 2-3x a week so the satory is coming along! it's so fun to see the stories sorta write themselves as you get into the personality of the characters... and weird .lore/worldbuilding just exposes itself to you through them living through it.

anyhow im happy with the progress so far; im trying to maintain meditating 3-4x a week, exercising 1-2x a week, and stay sane. i have a few nonprofits im working on cool projects with, then there's this hacker ocnference defcon coming up soon im gearing up for, then BURNING MAN for 2 weeks, then projects at work that im working ont hat im also speaking at a conference about, then some medical leave planned, then that conference, then re-starting my weekly infosec class on Twitch with more polish... so. phew. just lots to do; im just trying to eke out pieces of this story in the meantime. :smiley:
[1:02 AM] Sapphomo: now lemme read your lovely response
[1:12 AM] Sapphomo: " You may be saying exactly that." - YUP! but it can be hard to distinguish between the like... second/third/etc order emotional response to ego-structures and those unfiltered core being truths.

omg that joke is gold. for trade: why did Norway put barcodes on their ships?  So they could Scandinavian. 

ooo i am excited to dig into your ascii art pile.

icon is the character Ness from the surreal, absurdist, existential RPG for super nintendo called Earthbound :)

per Find the Others - do you listen to the podcast Team Human with Douglas Rushkoff? he is a lovely community-minded being and interviews other lovely humans. he consistently says this.

awesome. i love irwartfrr and 4DID. i have to take another gander thru this little metamind of yours at some point.
[1:13 AM] Sapphomo: oooo opening multiple tabs of this is not a good idea, lol
[1:25 AM] h0p3: Lol. That joke is terrible good. :smiley:
[1:27 AM] h0p3: My text art pile hasn't been growing much. The last two things I've liked have been these: https://philosopher.life/#Root:Root%20chameleon
[1:28 AM] Sapphomo: oh wow that's beautiful
[1:28 AM] Sapphomo: was that from art you found somewhere and converted?
[1:28 AM] h0p3: Yup.
[1:29 AM] h0p3: Had to tinker with it to make it fitting for asciification.
[1:29 AM] h0p3: I've seen Ness in Super Smash Brothers!
[1:29 AM] h0p3: Just couldn't put my finger on it.
[1:30 AM] Sapphomo: yesssss i was so happy he was in the original cuz only me and my friends seemed to have played
[1:30 AM] Sapphomo: i practice playing the most recent iteration of smash and hope to win a local tourney one day
[1:31 AM] h0p3: That is a game I enjoy watching more than playing, same with Starcraft.
[1:31 AM] h0p3: So much skill to them.
[1:32 AM] h0p3: Here soon will be joining my brother in https://project-ascension.com/. WoW modified to allow one to construct a character from the abilities/talents  of all of the classes.  I shouldn't be gaming though. Lol. Sucks me right in.
Ascension Classless WoW Servers
Ascension is a Classless community, creating new builds and ideas from hundreds of skills and abilities.
[1:33 AM] h0p3: I've never heard of Douglass Rushkoff. I keep trying to like podcasts, but they never stick with me.
[1:33 AM] h0p3: Something must be wrong with muh brain, lol. I find it really hard to beat an audiobook.
[1:34 AM] h0p3: But, I'll have to check that out. I'm lucky to see how others think and talk about it.
[1:36 AM] h0p3: Twine is cool. I see that popping up again and again.
[1:37 AM] h0p3: I have no idea how you are writing a story about it.
[1:37 AM] h0p3: You've been insanely busy too.
[1:37 AM] h0p3: Defcon sounds exceptionally fun.
[1:38 AM] Sapphomo: oh yeah i shouldnt touch that, it sounds too fun. games suck me in and then i obsess about minmaxing then get bored. pretty cool tho :smiley:
[1:38 AM] h0p3: Writing everyday adds up. How long do you think it will take at the pace you are going?
[1:39 AM] Sapphomo: if you can dig into an audiobook i think there may be hope for you with podcasts :smiley: i just make sure it's something im interested in or entertained by. i love the format; it feels like you're in a stimulating conversation with lovely humans
[1:40 AM] Sapphomo: ohhhhh well depends on how strongly i stick to schedules. but i feel like by the end of the year i will have the vast majority of the story story done. but there are lots of tech/challenges/etc to design as well, which i will probably dip into here and there.
[1:41 AM] Sapphomo: it's nice ot have lots of different parts to work on cuz if the creative writing parts arent firing when i sit down to write, then i can write the more technical pieces, or just filler pieces and room descriptions. the infosecronomicom is now a fractal infinite library where some lovely beings live but are trapped there. ending appears to be building towrad trying to release them
[1:46 AM] h0p3: That makes sense. Having a project where there's always something valuable to do regardless of your mood or mode is hard to beat.
[1:47 AM] Sapphomo: yes yes im happy to have gotten the idea to a point where im semi-consistently building instead of just theorizing - which mainly means scope creep and unrealizable ambitions, lol
[1:47 AM] Sapphomo: how goes your projects; life project, fun projects, children projects, any project that is bubbling up in ya
[2:04 AM] h0p3: My family and my wiki are my primary projects. After 3 years, it's now ~30MB of almost pure text (~60 novels at 100k words). I've been doing a lot of letter writing (though I'm not good at it). I've been lucky enough to see many people start wikis to engage in conversation with me. It's how my family stays organized and builds evidence of our homeschooling (we read ours wikis together during Family Time [https://philosopher.life/#Family%20Time]). My daughter's been drawing more (http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/#Gallery), and she's working on building a decentralized chatroom and shared to-do-lists inside of our wikis through ratox (http://git.2f30.org/ratox/file/README.html).  My son installed Arch today (cool for 11).  My brother just got a 2mo foster kid named Viper, and I'm trying to be useful to him. My wife has an interview with Yale in a couple days (which is kinda freaky for us). I've not been so lucky at finding jobs; I have an interview with the local pipefitter union, and I appreciate my job as an afterschool teacher at the school down the road from us (https://philosopher.life/#Afterschool%20Teaching). We might be precariat, but life is going well for us. I've been lucky enough to get a new computer recently (kids and I built it last week): https://philosopher.life/#monster-16. I'm in the process of designing the system from scratch and migrating.
[2:06 AM] Sapphomo: ooo i cant wait to dig in, but alas my cat is telling me it is TIME FOR BED, and he is right. a pleasure to reconnect and will chat soon :smiley:
[2:06 AM] h0p3: Sleep well!
