title: 2019.01.23 - Meditation: Med up

I started with meditation today to clear out my dream. I did some breathing exercises. I wash my faced, stretched, yogated and posed like a poser, and then went back for a brief meditation stint. I had a harder time meditating the second time around. I am trying to understand what makes meditation different from the calm that occurs right before I fall asleep or even as I just wake up from the blur of that virtual life. I think there is a concentration element to it, but I may be wrong.
