title: Metamodernism

Any effective reaction to and successful emergence from [[Postmodernism]]. Unfortunately, postmodernism is so successful a meme that our species seems to be failing to constructively respond. We must nurture hope and work hard to defeat this slippery monster.

Here are some crucial concepts to explore:

* [[Daoism]]
* [[Less Wrong]]
* [[Positive Disintegration]]
* [[Positive Nihilism]]
* [[Postmodernism]]
* [[The Technohuman Stack]]
* [[The Ring of h0p3]]
* [[Bayesian Confirmation Theory]]
* [[Growth Cycle]]
* [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]]
* [[The Purpose of Knowledge]]
* [[China Brain and Reality Simulations]]
* [[Conjecture: Eudaimonic Moral Virtue]]
* [[Creating Faith]]

This wiki is meant to be a metamodern work.

I am tired of the postmodern deconstruction of the world. I am tired of my derealization. I am tired of my disintregation. I'm ready to be malleable, just let me out. I need something practical since I can no longer afford the costs of being ideal. What is the right practical ground? Or is that question already missing the point? To what extent is metamodernism like [[Modernism]]? 

This wiki is a stream of consciousness work, famously modern. I keep having difficulty ascending to the last level in the [[Positive Disintegration]] framework. I definitely had a philosophically backwards upbringing. I have fought tooth and nail to adapt to my environment. This is where I find myself: I hope this wiki allows me to move forward to being metamodern rather than falling back on modernism and the certainty before it.
