hi

<<<
    > Can you describe a bit closer, what you want to do with the uni-link plugin? So I can try to create a test case, and do some "live-debugging"

    Basically, I want to be able to use an arbitrary number of initial names to functionally resolve to a single tiddler with a final name (I want the world!).

    My current awful noob hack (which is stupidly ugly) is to have multiple tiddlers which transclude the final one, but I would much rather not create a dozen tiddlers to point to just one, and I'd strongly prefer that all of them resolve to the same name.

I see. I'll have a closer look
