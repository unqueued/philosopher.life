Found out we have another $300 water bill, and we can't figure out why.
MON 10:07 AM
What’s on your plate today?
MON 10:07 AM
I punched holes through the door I was so angry. I'm fixing that now.
MON 10:07 AM
Can't catch a break
MON 10:07 AM
Feel like it's swallowing me up.
MON 10:08 AM
Otherwise, it's school for everyone.
MON 10:08 AM
How about you?
MON 10:08 AM
That sounds weird... have you called the water company?
MON 10:16 AM
I’m sorry. I hope things get back to normal soon...
MON 10:17 AM
Our landlords are coming out yet again to check on it.
MON 10:17 AM
Work and writing. Gonna be packing for vacation soon. :)
MON 10:17 AM
I thought it was solved the last time.
MON 10:17 AM
Good. Good.
MON 10:17 AM
Yay! Vacation. =)

We are going to a con in Sandusky OH and staying with some friends for a week too.
MON 10:24 AM
IIRC, they have a big theme park up there.
MON 10:25 AM
Cedar Point I think....
MON 10:26 AM
Yes, that's the one.
MON 10:27 AM
Assuming you go in costume, what will you be dressing up as for the con?
MON 1:52 PM
Thinking of a vacation Todoroki from My Hero, Kageyama from Haikyuu, Meliodas from Seven Deadly Sins, and a Team Skull Grunt from Pokémon.
MON 2:22 PM
Those are my plans anyway. We’ll see what happens. XD
MON 3:17 PM
Lots of costumes. I assume you'll be changing up every day or so, eh?
MON 3:45 PM
Yes! Thursday- Sunday :)
