title: 2018.01.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Money Suitcase

!! If you found a suitcase full of money in the middle of the street, what would you do?

Previously, I'd have told you I would take it to the police. But, after learning more about how that is handled, I'm not convinced that's the correct thing to do. I suppose I'd create some flyers, newspaper ads, CL, and whatever I could think of with a throwaway e-mail, asking if they recently lost something valuable. If they described it, they could have it back. Otherwise, I'm going to use it.
