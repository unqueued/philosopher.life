!! If you were given $1 million that you had to spend on yourself within a year, how would you spend it?

All the fun questions!

I assume I can't simply invest it for pure capital returns. I assume I can't just put it into accounts reserved (even by law) for particular purposes (like my children's educations). 

* I'd build a custom house near Louisville, KY that would set us up for life.
* I'd build a significant shop.
* I'd set aside some money for the kids to spend for short-term, mid-term, and long-term needs. I'd love for them to have the chance to manage money.
* I'd buy all the school supplies we'd need.
* I'd buy vehicles.
* I'd buy new computers for everyone.
* I'd give serious gifts and money to my family members.
