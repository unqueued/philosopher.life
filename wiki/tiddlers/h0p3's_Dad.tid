title: h0p3's Dad

* Where he's from:
** He was born in ~1963 and primarly raised in the Boston and Brockton, MA area. 
** He lived in the Southie ghetto, but also lived nearby the ocean for a time. He reminds me of Will Hunting from Good Will Hunting.<<ref "1">>
*** He has the poor New Englander mentality deep down in him. It hovers between psychopathic Mass-hole to the classic New England self-deprecation of someone who has experienced significant abuse resulting in at least a mild inferiority complex.
** After his Christian conversion and eventually his parents' conversion, they moved to San Diego. They eventually moved back to Massachusetts. 
** He eventually moved to Chicago to study at Moody Bible Institute, and then to Louisville to study at Souther Baptist Seminary. From there, he moved around Kentucky as a pastor, and eventually to Thailand. He currently spends slightly over 50% of the year in Thailand for tax purposes. 

* Upbringing
** His mother remarried to a rough man, and my dad was their first child. 
** He was raised by people with very poor mental health, amidst substance use, prostitution, psychological abuse, and serious violence. All the kids in his family are fucked up (we barely have a relationship with any of them). 
*** His kids faired no better, it seems; the cycle continues.
*** He has little experience with responsible drug-use (outside alcohol). Given his past, religious beliefs, and his line of work (which mostly sees the bad stuff in people's lives), he is irrationally anti-drug (and raised his children to be so as well).
** He was lucky to have access to decent schools and libraries. Massachusetts is famous for it.
*** He also worked at a very young age to pay for private schools. 
**** He's been a workaholic from a young age. He feels superior in having earned everything he has (and to a large extent he has). He also views the world through that lens and foists the same obligations on others. 
** He was always poor. He fought a lot. He worked very hard. 
*** He has bought into the Christianized American Dream.
**** He would deny it, but it is obvious that he has slowly let go of some of it, piece by piece, but only as he is required to maintain a semblance of logical coherence in his belief system.
**** He has bought the lies about socialism and whole-hearted agrees to capitalism.

* Psychology
** ENTJ
** A psychopath tamed by his faith with strong empathic intuitions towards children. He can turn it off though, I promise you.
*** His salesmanship is part of his dark triadicism.
** He is a very intelligent man, with solid quantitative reasoning skills, and possesses above average knowledge in a variety of fields.
*** His favorite fields likely being Theology/Biblical Studies, Physics, Computer science, and Economics. 
*** His intellectual goal would be somewhere between Spock and what he often refers to as a Renaissance man.
*** And, yet, he is surprisingly anti-intellectual. This is likely because the educated people he meets deeply disagree with him about the fabric of the world. 
** His intellectual contradiction seems to be trusting authority too much while also being contrarian.<<ref "1">>




** He does not empathize with most adults (especially as he aged), but will bend over backwards for children. The thought of children in pain has always been difficult for him to handle. He clearly has his demons. 



* Religious Beliefs
** He's a pastor/missionary. It's fundamental to who he is.
** He believes he has literally witnesses miracles, angels, and demons.
** I believe he has an internal struggle with bisexuality.
*** His roommate, who shared his first name, was gay. This had a profound influence on my father. 
*** He was "funny" or "odd" as a child, and had to "toughen up" when they moved to San Diego according to my grandmother.
*** Has absurd concepts about the nature of human sexuality and how to define it.
*** He's a young sibling.

* Politics
** Conservative/Libertarian
*** The only thing which holds him back, of course, are "the children."
*** Since he has gotten older, he's beginning to see the value in universalized healthcare. This is too late though.
