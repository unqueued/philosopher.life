Combined 3 ios to make a Lum to make Smoke. I need the resists. Made 2 P-diamond dragon shield with third slot open for another Pdiamond, when I can finally find the components. Decided not to use Teleport + 9AResist ammy. I'm going for raw defense and MF on my gear, minus the primary hand, since I desperately need +skill gear.

I got to Stony field WP. I could handle the crypt, so I can handle The Hole. Bad packs will be rough, but I can Save and Exit liberally, right? I need to be able to move effectively with my minions, so The Hole is a safe way to grind major gear safely. Baal runs even with gear can be dangerous (although death is extremely rare, and you have to be pushing hard).
