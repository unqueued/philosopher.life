title: 2019.01.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Fake News Scale
type: 

!! Respond to the following gem:

Why can't my scale give me fake news?

I suppose it could. IoT scales probably exist. Although, some people might have just enough privacy consciousness to avoid that one. I realize this is a joke. I am not convinced, however, that most people have much skill in curating and analyzing their information sources. Even I consider myself an abject failure all too often in this sphere (though I am sometimes proud).

I tend to lack trust across the board here, and at the same time, I consider it my duty to voraciously hunt for the most truthful semblance of the truth I can. I don't think most people are ~~paranoic~~ introspective enough about themselves and their ingroup. 

It annoys me that people appear to imply this is a new problem. Rhetoric is dangerous; even the ancients knew.
