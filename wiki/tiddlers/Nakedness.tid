Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” He said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.” He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”

Given the evolution of lice, homo sapiens may have started covering themselves about 170 millennia ago as a behavioral adaptation to protect themselves from the elements.<<ref "f">> Qua the immediate survival value of clothing, decoratively covering one's nakedness became a virtue signal and demonstration of status at least 40 millennia ago, at the beginning of human behavioral modernity. Through survivorship bias and prosperity teaching reinforcement, gymnophobic modesty norms and subjective decency memeplexes of physiological self-concealment permeated human cultures.

Myths arose to help us confabulate propagandistic justifications for covering our nakedness for the sake of cool consensus-building, uniform domination, and perpetuating power structures in material<<ref "r">> dialectics. Ironically, elective nudity became just as performative as covering ourselves. There appear to be two especially valuable yet contrary symbolic interpretive clusters of nakedness.

On the one hand, nakedness figuratively indicates the heroic, noble savagery, the [[beauty]] of sexuality, our initial harmonious natural state, romantic paradise, as well as a blissful openness to vulnerability, helplessness, innocence, defenselessness, and unencumbered freedom to wander the Garden instead of the desert. On the other hand, nakedness can symbolize or induce humiliation, guilt, shame, the appearance of poverty, the commodification of sexuality, the terrifying awareness of the dangers of exposure, a second-stage primal desire for privacy, as well as fallenness and atonement. 

Nakedness may be even more symbolically [[power]]ful than blindness.<<ref "b">> Awareness of one's nakedness requires an awareness of the [[other]]. We cover the origin of fear with the supposed shame of nakedness. We know we are capable of evil, and hence we know others are as well.

Why should you care what [[others]] see in or on you? When is your nakedness vulgar and when is it pure? How much of yourself should you hide from yourself and [[others]]? What will you reveal and cover yourself with and why? How objectionable, undignified, tactless, gratuitous, or tasteless do you find naked honesty?
