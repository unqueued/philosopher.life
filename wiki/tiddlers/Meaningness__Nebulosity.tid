title: Meaningness: Nebulosity

<<<
“Nebulosity” means “cloud-like-ness.” Meaningness is cloud-like. It is real, but impossible to completely pin down.
<<<

I am open to NP-Hard problems, Incompleteness, and the Trascendent. You must be specific about what you mean by "impossible" and "completely pin down." I can tell you aren't going to provide this, which means you are just pointing to a theory rather than providing one.

<<<
“Nebulosity” refers to the intangible, transient, amorphous, non-separable, ambiguous nature of meaningness...I will not give a precise definition of “nebulosity” here. Instead, I present analogies. I apologize if the meaning of “nebulosity” seems frustratingly nebulous. I find that unsatisfactory myself. I hope that an understanding of the word will emerge from its use later in the book. I believe that a rigorous definition is possible; but it would be highly technical. I explain some reasons for that in my page on nebulosity and “emptiness.”
<<<

The analytic philosopher in me has little patience for it, but I know that is a mistake to apply in general. We'll find out if you deserve my attention.

<<<
When you think of the piece as a whole, its meaningfulness can seem quite solid. But when listening to it, you cannot say “this bit means this, and that bit means that.” The meaning becomes thin and wispy, in a sense.
<<<

Take classes in metaphysics and aesthetics. There are serious philosophical points of view to take up here. It's not quibbling. 

<<<
What an art work means can change over time. Some songs that were tremendously meaningful when I was fifteen seem quite meaningless now. The meaning of the religious carvings of the Rapanui people of Easter Island is mostly permanently lost.
<<<

People change, and so do their memes. This is about the stories we tell ourselves. The previous problem you talked about was about the fundamental structure and nature of even telling a story in the first place.

<<<
It is very difficult to say anything about what instrumental music means—even when you are sure it is highly meaningful.
<<<

I am pleased to see you have a broad definition of meaning. Emotivists wouldn't accept it. Oddly enough, I think it isn't as meaningful as others. I know this as a musicians of decades and as a pure addict of this drug. I'm not saying it isn't meaningful, but I'm skeptical about its nature in a way you don't display or imply here.

<<<
Music comes in separate pieces (such as songs), maybe with separate meanings. But life does not come in well-defined chunks. “Spiritual” meanings are not clearly separable; they flow or shade into each other.
<<<

This is a poor argument. Chunking is part of your problem in discussing the structure of meaning. This isn't the first instance of it. Scope and recursion go a long way. I think you are shockingly not computational enough in your understanding of metaphysics.

<<<
Meaningfulness and meaninglessness also shade into each other. Meaningness has infinite gradations of intangibility. It can be impossible to say whether something has meaning or not.
<<<

You appear to only understand it through this lens. You have shockingly little charity or ability to interpret eternalist and nihilist points of view with similar charity. I hope you explore the reasons for this impossibility and explain its modality.

<<<
In the language of philosophy, nebulosity is an ontological fact, not an epistemological one. As a result, my accounts of eternalism and nihilism differ somewhat from the related accounts given by Robert Ellis. His philosophy is exclusively epistemological, and rejects ontological claims altogether.
