*** Unfortunately, I'm one greedy son-of-a-bitch. There was nothing comparable for my needs from AMD. My compact 750ti could be fanless, it's that fucking cold and small. The price point was impossible to beat, and I've had an easier time with it than my AMD cards I hate to say.

*** I continue to believe that Julia, Rust, and Go are crucial languages to learn for building awesome new tools. Those who need to work on Legacy systems, of course, may have little interest in them.
