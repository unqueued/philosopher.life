How's it going, Brad?
FRI 12:29 PM
How's it going buddy want to come over
FRI 12:47 PM
Whatcha doing today?
FRI 12:47 PM
It goes okay. Grinding away. I appreciate the offer. I can't. Between work, chores, and school for the kiddos, I don't have the time. =/ #adulting.
FRI 12:48 PM
You working
5 HR AGO
Not today.
5 HR AGO
Family Time
5 HR AGO
Cool
5 HR AGO
How about you?
5 HR AGO
what you up to?
5 HR AGO
Are you busy want me to yell at you later
5 HR AGO
Yeah, I'm busy. But, still interested to know how you are doing.
5 HR AGO
Just got done building a cute little computer, it is really nice, I used that white case with a third generation i7 and 16gb and I installed a m.2 pci express adapter with a 512gb ngff m. 2 2280 card
5 HR AGO
Very cool.
5 HR AGO
I told my customer that putting that kind of hard drive with a third generation i7 would be a big bottleneck, but hey what can you do?
5 HR AGO
?
5 HR AGO
Why do you think that?
5 HR AGO
It's a m.2 card that runs off your pci express lanes however it's supposed to be version 3.0 but since the motherboard is so old it's version 2.0 so he's not going to get the speed that he paid for that m. 2 hard drive, about half if that, I would have went with a sata ssd since it's older hardware
5 HR AGO
Your opinion my friend
5 HR AGO
I found a good deal on ebay 5 256 gb ssds for $40 and 5 DVD burner for $25
5 HR AGO
noice =)
5 HR AGO
I love other people's junk
5 HR AGO
It's like gold to me
5 HR AGO
What socket is your motherboard
5 HR AGO
1150
5 HR AGO
I have a friend who is trying to get me to trade on a 1150 17 and a Intel motherboard he's only wanting a 1155 motherboard for it is it anything you could use in your system
5 HR AGO
I send him a message hold on
5 HR AGO
Nothing I can use. My next upgrade will be for RAM.
5 HR AGO
I7 4750k
5 HR AGO
Fourth generation I think
5 HR AGO
How much ram you got
5 HR AGO
16GB
5 HR AGO
That is max capacity on my system
5 HR AGO
Oh I was going to give you some of my spare ddr3
5 HR AGO
I appreciate that. That's kind of you.
5 HR AGO
I'm building a system tomorrow that also has a ceiling of 16gb its a 1155 board and a Second generation I3
5 HR AGO
Super machine
5 HR AGO
I'm just going to put 8gb in it I think with a 13 anymore would be wasted don't you think
5 HR AGO
Yeah, 8GB sounds more appropriate.
4 HR AGO
I have no idea what they are going to do with a machine that small
4 HR AGO
lol
4 HR AGO
I think you'd be shocked what I can do with 64MB of RAM
4 HR AGO
Seriously though can that even be used
4 HR AGO
yeah, that is plenty of firepower for the average person
4 HR AGO
Yeah I'm sure I would what would you do besides creating a virtual drive
4 HR AGO
I wouldn't be virtualizing with only 64MB of RAM
4 HR AGO
My point is that you can do a ton on a tiny machine (I'm not talking about GB, I'm talking about MB)
4 HR AGO
Lol
4 HR AGO
You are joking
4 HR AGO
Nope.
4 HR AGO
Linux is extremely powerful and lightweight. Alpine Linux, as the full OS, fits inside a 5MB container.
4 HR AGO
Build a raspberrie
4 HR AGO
Aye. I have had many.
4 HR AGO
What type of computer would be that small
4 HR AGO
An excellent question. Computers are everywhere, in everything.
4 HR AGO
I think raspberrys are bigger than 64mb
4 HR AGO
Indeed, much bigger
4 HR AGO
Do you know what a raspberry is
4 HR AGO
You can also buy/rent cheap VPS
4 HR AGO
I said I did.
4 HR AGO
I bought the first version on preorder.
4 HR AGO
What's a vps
4 HR AGO
Virtual Private Server
4 HR AGO
I used an RPI as my HTPC for a long time.
4 HR AGO
Is that what you would use a raspberry for
4 HR AGO
nope
4 HR AGO
Though, it can
4 HR AGO
Dude what the heck are you talking about
4 HR AGO
What's a rpi
4 HR AGO
https://www.raspberrypi.org/
4 HR AGO
Extremely famous computer
4 HR AGO
Do you have any raspberrys or other small computer systems for sale or trade
4 HR AGO
no
4 HR AGO
Can I hire you to help me learn how to build a raspberry I really don't know what they do I've just heard of them
4 HR AGO
You don't need to hire me.
4 HR AGO
You also should do this entirely on your own by researching online. That's, in fact, why the device is manufactured. It is a teaching tool.
4 HR AGO
I can't really think of anything that I would use one for
4 HR AGO
You should learn Linux.
4 HR AGO
Can I get a pre-built one or order the parts
4 HR AGO
A question worth googling.
4 HR AGO
Seriously, that's part of the process.
4 HR AGO
It's a teaching tool, and it will require you to search often for an answer.
4 HR AGO
Yeah I'm looking now it's says that they can be used as a web server
4 HR AGO
Indeed
4 HR AGO
How about a raspberry pi 3 model b with ac adapter and camera cable
4 HR AGO
Ask yourself what you want to accomplis.
4 HR AGO
Well I would like to build a server for extra storage
4 HR AGO
A NAS?
4 HR AGO
Go Unraid
4 HR AGO
But I've never been trained in that field
4 HR AGO
So?
4 HR AGO
You gotta start somewhere, dude.
4 HR AGO
Unraid?
3 HR AGO
Google for it
3 HR AGO
It will be a good place to start thinking about the problem
3 HR AGO
I'm going to order me one tomorrow and read and research it out, sounds like fun
3 HR AGO
I think you should research and plan before you order anything here.
3 HR AGO
How did you know that I run raid 0 on my pc
3 HR AGO
You told me that.
3 HR AGO
You are absolutely right that what I just said I can order a used one with a 375gb hard drive and everything that is made for it but I don't know how old the mobo is
3 HR AGO
