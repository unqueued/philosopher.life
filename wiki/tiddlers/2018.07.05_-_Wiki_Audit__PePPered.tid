Ah, [[PPP]] is alive. This is good. I can see that I don't want to force myself into any categories in my philosophical log. It's too difficult, and I don't need to do with faithful zeal like my axioms. 

Kant, I'm coming for you. I'm going to ram Platonic Gödel down your throat.

I need to be more effective at breaking out of my Link Log with links that really pique my interest. I need to stop forcing myself into a single small little nested note structure and just use actual pages with actual quotes, etc. I need to do it like I usually do my deep reading. It's time to smooth the transition from hyperreading to deepreading, which really means I'm engaged in actual writing (shitty though it may be).
