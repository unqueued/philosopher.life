25% MF gloves from the shop. Good drops for my A2 merc. He's one-shotting stuff. I'm fucking bulldozing. Using TP as a ghetto teleport is hilarious. Immediate jumped to 3 magi. Think I will pour everything into skellies, then mastery, then magi, while still picking up the usual on the way to 30.

I like looting while my minions kill. It's a nice balance.
