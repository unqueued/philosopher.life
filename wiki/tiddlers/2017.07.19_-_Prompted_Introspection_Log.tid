!! What do you think dreams mean?

I have no idea. The fact that we dream is fascinating. What evolutionary advantage does it provide, or why would we dream at all? It is unclear to the experts why we really need to sleep in the first place, and I fear that without answering that question, we may not be able to answer why we dream either (they seem intertwined). 

I suspect that dreams are a key piece to keeping our computer of a brain working as we need to it. Perhaps it is an upkeep cost we must pay each night. Dreaming may also tell us what it means to be conscious, to tell ourselves sequences of narratives, and perhaps eventually provide us insight into how our memory operates. 

I often feel tempted by the notion that dreams are a place where I actually process the real world in some dormant state. Maybe they are practice runs or reruns. It feels like dreams are a method to re-live, reinvent, merge old memories, subconsciously test ideas, etc. Again, this temptation isn't based on nearly enough evidence for me to agree to it. I must claim ignorance.

It is often the case that I wake up with a headache after a difficult, visually and emotionally intensive dream. It seems to me like my brain is working hard in the dream. I am often stressed (sometimes in a good way, but generally in a bad way) in my dreams and as I come out of them. I do not understand why. 

Importantly, I have a terrible memory about what occurs in my dreams. As soon as I've woken up, I tend to lose my train of thought, my memory of what happens in them, and the details fade. Sometimes, before I wake up, I may have a bit more awareness about the fact that I'm dreaming, it seems like I can zone in and out of it, and maybe have a modicum more control in it. I don't believe I dream with a lot of detail in the first place. I'm not a lucid dreamer either, I believe. When I go to recount what happens in my dream, I often find myself trying to fill in the gaps (confabulation). It is better not to lie to myself. I can only give approximations if that is the best I can do. Often, I just say it was set in a particular place and roughly about X. Beyond that, I have little I can say.

I don't think dreams have any mystical powers. I think we should be incredibly slow to interpret them as anything more than very curious stories our brain is telling "us" (whatever counts as us). I will agree that many humans attach meaning to these dreams, but I think they are often unjustified. When we treat dreams like magic, more than the magic of a good fantasy narrative, we have stepped outside the bounds of reason.

I often find that if I've been concentrating very hard on a particular issue, problem, or practice during the course of my day that I will almost always dream about it. If you play the same video game for hours all day, your dreams will be laced with the content and sometimes the phenomenology of the game. Last night, for example, I could only dream about work as a pipefitter. That's what I did all day, and it was stressful.

Now, is this my brain forming memories? Is this my brain digesting the day? Is this my brain trying out different counterfactuals and possible worlds, running the scenarios? I have no idea. Is it meaningful to me? Yes, but how, to what extent, in that regard, I do not know. It was an emotional and barely Dasein experience. I feel more like an observer and subject in my dreams.
