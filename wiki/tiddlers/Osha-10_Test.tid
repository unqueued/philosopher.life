title: Osha-10 Test

Don't get me wrong. I think what OSHA is meant to do is incredibly valuable. I hope they are world-class effective at regulating work environments. I'm a leftist completely in favor of OSHA's stated mission. The OSHA-10 course+test, however, is deplorable.

You take a pre-exam worth nothing. You don't care if you get a zero (they tell you it doesn't matter what score you get), so you'll literally not try because it doesn't matter. Then they run you through a shitty course taking X amount of time with tons of cheaty faced ways to force you to consume time without actually learning (gross). I'm getting 100's on these tests and just clicking through. I think there is no way you can complete this course in 10 hours. It's designed to literally take up time without teaching you anything. There's something wrong about this course structure (but I'm glad I'm getting it done). You take shitty intermediate exams and final which are designed to allow you to pass; it isn't a real testing system. At the end, they have metrics which "show:" you spent over 10 hours "learning" and appear to have really learned something because of the difference in pre-exam and final exam scores. But, the reason the final exam scores are likely so much higher is because people will actually try. You can fucking google the question and the answer shows up. While the information is important, this course/testing seems like a kind of scam.
