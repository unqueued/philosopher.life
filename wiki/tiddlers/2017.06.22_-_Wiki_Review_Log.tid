title: 2017.06.22 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.06.21 - Cry Log]]
** Pictures can be haunting.
* [[Cover Letter]]
** It's kind of shitty, too generalized, and there isn't enough specified ass-kissing in it.
* [[2017.06.21 - Carpe Diem Log]]
** That was a productive day!
* [[2017.06.21 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** I was talking to my friend ALM about this today. We are homebodies, no doubt. But, even he agreed that it is good for us to force ourselves into the world. It's true.
* [[2017.06.21 - Diet Log]]
** Summed.

** I was thinking about this log in the car today. I think it provides a very unique context to how I give shape to the wiki and myself. It's a running dialogue with myself that I'm pleased is there even if only for posterity's sake. That said, I think it is more useful than that!
