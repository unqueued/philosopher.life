title: 2018.12.02 - Prompted Introspection: Finding Treasure

!! If you found treasure worth millions in your backyard, would you keep it a secret or would you tell the world?

I'd sell it quietly, and do as I'd usually do with millions in my [[Prompted Introspection]] questions, e.g. [[2018.11.18 - Prompted Introspection: Lottery Wish]]. I don't care about fame. I would like to have good friends, I'd like to have a reasonable impact in the material dialectic to decentralize power, and I'd like to live in my own head. =)
