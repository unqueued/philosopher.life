title: 2019.09.30 - Afterschool Teaching: Schizm

I walk in to see 8J2m sitting at the same spot in trouble again. He's copying straight out of an ancient encyclopedia as a punishment. He says his mom is drunk today as usual. We talk about his safety.

I arrived to both Whitney and MadameM (a.k.a 13HMf) there. Prep was fast. MadameM has full rides to UT and ETSU, and I was shocked to see her attending the school she does. She's scared. I get it. Her mom thinks she's making a mistake too. We talked about child psych. I am no fun here. Of course, I am the asshole who has an opinion on everything.

One of my high school cheerleaders comes in distressed. When I ask her how she's doing, she usually answers "//great//" sarcastically. I commented on it, and she explains that her teacher laid into her and told her to put a jacket on because she's "distracting the boys and arousing them." She's marginally more dolled up in a striped getup (pants and blouse) for the homecoming queen competition meant to train my children to attract sexual attention put on by the school itself mind you, so the hypocrisy is blowing my mind. Oh, noes, guis, it's her fault that the boys can't do their schoolwork, let's shame her, interrupt her learning, and send her radically mixed signals between objectifying her and blaming her for being objectified. You want to be a good girl who shows her camel toe at the right moments but never her shoulders, alright? Remember to protect what makes you valuable to those who want to fuck you because that's all you are really useful for in the end.

One-on-ones were fantastic, though I had lots of whackamole. I think my students are becoming more offensive and whiny with each other in some cases. They are more intermingled. Delp has stopped attempting to enforce that dumb rule. 

Chess club showed up. I had a ton of students who played, mostly 5th. Matt took the remaining 5th and some 6th. I took everyone else with MadameM. The library was our only option, but I'm glad.

Not a ton of homework, but I had some folks who needed to study. The library only became intense when all the forces were combined.

My students and I practiced hiding our devices more effectively and preparing ourselves to lie to the authorities. =)

MadameM worked with 8J. Deer and headlights from her, understandably. This is who she claims she wants to work with. She's an interesting person, no doubt. She's a pro at school busywork, but her dialectical skills are weak. She plays multiple sports, trumpet, and she can sing. She comes from poverty, but she has a tendency to make the most of her resources. Her memory is strong, I'm guessing 125 IQ, and she picks up cues quickly. She's extremely attached to her phone but toggles her attention well. She knows most of the students (even if they don't know her) because she has attended school functions with their family members. She is patient, but was clearly annoyed several times today: she was constructive. Her moral reasoning is not well-trained, but she is generous and disciplined.

8A talked with me about being able to tickle himself. We talked about schizophrenia; some students listened carefully, but 8A kept begging me to just get to the point (I am, ofc, the worst). That was a fun conversation. 7D then said some of the things which I talked about were constant experiences for him. The floors, ceilings, etc. moved. I know that feel bro. I believe I've had one aural hallucination, but it sounds like voices are far more common for him. We talked about comorbidity and I've asked him to never use drugs. He's not told his parents yet (I have no fucking clue how, since that should be something he's talked about many times with them, right?); I told him he should speak with them, and if and when he feels comfortable, also with a doctor. We talked about famous people who were schizophrenic. I was asked who I thought the smartest humans in history were. Hello, Saints.

Delp was clearly annoyed that students were asking him about the ban. He ignored me often today. Cool. More time with the kids. By the tail end of the day, the last stragglers remember so clearly why they are here and what it means. It's good for them not to be alone.

The Janitors and I talked for a few minutes. They had some busy weekends.
