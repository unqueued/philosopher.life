title: 2017.01.25 - Pipefitting Log

I'm finished with all the major tests except for OSHA-10. We finally got through the major bookwork necessary to start working in the shop. I actually threaded pipe today. It's easy. I'm glad it is easy too. I want to perfect it and streamline this process, from the tiny hand movements, to planning, to logistics, etc. I want to understand the variations in the tools, to be an effective troubleshooter. 

Today, my partner, Nash, clearly failed to measure correctly (twice) and fucked up the threads a couple times. At least for now, I work faster and with few errors without him, I believe (with time, I'm sure we'll equalize). Thankfully, there are two different threading machines (one shop and another portable) which we will take turns on. We've decided we are going to divide the work to complete projects and to plan how to divide the work wisely, fairly, etc. We want to smash this course.
