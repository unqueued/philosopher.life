<<<
Gorsuch has slanted decidedly right. He has actively defended the death penalty, opposes assisted suicide, and generally supports “tough-on-crime” laws. A religious conservative
<<<

To be clear, this is one particular strain of rightism.

<<<
Condemning individual justices can lead us to vest hope in a body that has played a central role in sustaining and cementing inequality and racism.
<<<

Perhaps. Are you sure you mean exactly this?

<<<
The streets — not the courts — are the locus of the Left’s power.
<<<

Brawl a boxer, box a brawler. You can't win on their turf. I would argue that several threads of rightism also exist on the streets not in the courts. This has more to do with how the less powerful must fight the powerful. 

<<<
But originalism, especially its modern textualist variant, poses a particularly insidious ideological barrier to social change.
<<<

Preach, yo! But, that's the entire point of conservatism. This is, of course, below the belt. 

<<<
there is no other way to reason about the law that isn’t judicial activism.
<<<

I'm not convinced it is conceptually possible for a judge to not be engaged in judicial activism. I think it comes in [[dok]].

<<<
The first is that the Constitution is legitimate because it was enacted through a historical social contract: a free and democratic plurality of Americans chose to accept it, and to bind their descendants to the text unless they otherwise altered the law through amendments.
<<<

I think this is an attack on contractualism, not merely originalism (who definitely wield it a fuckton). Like the very metaethical notion of consent, this is a quagmire of a topic. Even the Kantians are screwed (I'm not a fan of Hobbes), and this is their bailiwick! I'm not in disagreement with you, but I think almost everyone on the political spectrum is in deep shit trying to answer this kind of problem. 

I'm fine agreeing to a claim that conservatives are more likely to sweep this problem under the rug though. They benefit from it quite a bit. One side is clearly more dangerously wielding this problem moreso than another. I agree to the asymmetry.

This issue is actually one of the things I'm trying to practically flesh out in [[The Original Position]]. Obviously, we have to maximize democratic consent and decentralize power. 

<<<
The second premise of originalist textualism is that, since the Constitution was historically legitimated by “the people,” judges should respect the literal meaning their words had at the time. It is not for a judge to overturn the democratic will of the people unless the language of the legal text requires them to do so.
<<<

Oh boy. This is also a quagmire for everyone. I agree conservatives abuse it, but I also have to hold up my end of the bargain here and admit I don't have it solved (and probably can't). That doesn't make the failures equal, of course.

Even if we move into conceptually purer languages like [[Ithkuil]] or some kind of Legal [[Rust]] for a blockchain, we're going to have serious interpretative problems. I can see the sense in a process where we extract the principle and apply it. My gut is to go with the spirit of the law, but then there is only one law: [[The Golden Rule]]. I'm not convinced judicial activism is escapable. 

<<<
Originalist textualists are no less activist than their peers. They’re just less open about it.
<<<

Preach.

<<<
With the imminent appointment of Neil Gorsuch, an even more reactionary originalist than Antonin Scalia
<<<

Fun fact, we were living NO when Scalia died. It had a great party.

<<<
But textualists need to be singled out as especially malicious because of their self-portrayal as uniquely unbiased and respectful of democracy.
<<<

I'm fine with that.
