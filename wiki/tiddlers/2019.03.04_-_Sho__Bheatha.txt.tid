You have my sympathy, being busy. I hate being busy.
MON 4:11 PM
I think I was so busy in my teens and 20s that now I just value not having to do anything
MON 4:12 PM
The joy of just being there.
MON 4:12 PM
Grown up Sho would NOT get through Berea w a 3.63 :sweat_smile:

MON 4:12 PM
If at all
MON 4:12 PM
My most common theme in generic anxiety dreams is having homework/reports to write
MON 4:13 PM
True story, bro
MON 4:13 PM
I love the nothing
MON 4:13 PM
All about the nothing
MON 4:13 PM
I bet you'd do fine in Berea again, but the nothing is nice.
MON 4:13 PM
I was just thinking about Dr. Hoag recently. You remember when he would smile in class?
MON 4:14 PM
That's when you knew you were in real trouble.
MON 4:14 PM
Like you had dug your own grave, lol.
MON 4:14 PM
I like to think that makes me a bit zen, but I ken I'm just lazy. So, I think of myself kinda as the female version of the dude lol
MON 4:14 PM
La Dudinera

MON 4:15 PM
I considered applying for a philosophy teaching position at Berea.
MON 4:15 PM
Not going to happen.
MON 4:15 PM
That's not the one Jarrod's got, is it?
MON 4:15 PM
He's the only person I ken working there
MON 4:16 PM
I do not know which position is open.
MON 4:16 PM
You're better off out of there
MON 4:16 PM
yeah, probably
MON 4:16 PM
Oh this is recently. Thought you meant long ago. Think Jarrod is there about 3 years, maybe. Or 2
MON 4:16 PM
But I'm certain he'll not stay
MON 4:17 PM
Why's that?
MON 4:17 PM
I really loved Berea.
MON 4:17 PM
Not that I've had more than 3 sentences from him in about as many years!
MON 4:17 PM
I did too, but then Scotland stole me ;)
MON 4:17 PM
