title: McManus: The Virtue of Nationalism—An Internationalist’s Critique

Hazony then argues that this historical process of consensual inclusion into broader political associations should stop at the nation state level.
<<<

Red fucking flag. Arbitrary fucking line.

<<<
Therefore, Hazony believes that national freedom should be the “ordering principle” of the world order, since even where it leads to disaster, it is freer and less violent than attempting to establish an international empire or law, whether oriented by liberal or any other principles.
<<<

No idea why anyone should agree to that.

<<<
But Hazony feels this is preferable to an “imperial” project which will have to be enforced by central authorities, and which he believes could only be achieved through immense repression.
<<<

The Rule of Law is centralized, but its source of authority can be fully decentralized! It is not clear to me that international governance is conceptually imperial, though I agree it allows us to put our money where our mouth is when we claim to take each other to be equals.

<<<
At various times, Hazony offers an olive branch to neoliberals who long for the breakdown of borders.
<<<

/wink. Globalization only insofar as the elite in my nation or the transnational elite (who are ruled by no one) benefit, right?
