Susan Brison’s “The Autonomy Defense of Free Speech”


Many liberals take a quasi-libertarian view on speech rights. They think that speech is worthy of special protection. And many, like Dworkin, Scanlon, and Nagel, try to justify this position on grounds of autonomy. They oppose restrictions on pornography and hate speech, for instance, largely on autonomy-based grounds.


“Hate speech,” of course, is notoriously hard to define. Brison defines it as speech that vilifies individuals or groups on the basis of such characteristics as race, sex, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, which (1) constitutes face-to-face vilification, (2) creates a hostile or intimidating environment, or (3) is a kind of group libel.


She thinks that hate speech should be distinguished from “fighting words,” but it’s not clear what the distinction is except that the former explicitly mentions sex, race, etc. And it’s not clear why speech targeting those things warrants special opprobrium. After all, there are many other ways to harm people with words.


Many, of course, are opposed to such restrictions, sometimes for reasons of autonomy. Is there, then, an autonomy-based case for free speech quasi-libertarianism?


That case, I think, must start with an understanding of the ways in which autonomy can be undermined. And that requires drawing distinctions between autonomous desires, autonomous actions, and autonomous persons/lives. Living an autonomous life, perhaps, requires more than just performing autonomous actions.


If there is an autonomy-based case against hate speech restrictions, then, it would have to be shown that such restrictions undermine autonomy, and that can be done by showing that they prevent the formation of autonomous desires, that they prevent these desires from being expressed in action, or that they prevent people from living autonomous lives.


Of course, one would also have to show that autonomy is important – that we should care whether hate speech restrictions would undermine it. And its alleged importance can be understood along consequentialist or deontological lines.


On a consequentialist model, autonomy can be seen as a value to be maximized; all else being equal, the more autonomy, the better. On a deontological model, autonomy grounds a constraint on the pursuit of the good. On this model autonomy isn’t a value to be maximized but a constraint to be respected.


For liberals, the deontological model seems hard to defend. After all, why can the government place restrictions on what I can do but not on what I can say? If autonomy explains the latter, then why not extend that reasoning to the former? This suggests (to me, anyway) that we should work within a consequentialist model. Perhaps that model can make sense of the alleged asymmetry between speech acts and non-speech acts.


Working within the consequentialist model, then, how might one defend the quasi-libertarian view of speech?


I doubt that the best arguments here will be autonomy-based, but it might be possible to make an autonomy-based case. One would have to show that hate speech restrictions would prevent the formation of autonomous desire, would prevent such desires from motivating action, or would prevent people from living autonomous lives. And one would have to show that autonomy wouldn’t be thus undermined in the absence of these restrictions.


Some think that hate speech restrictions would undermine the formation of autonomous desire (Brison explores this possibility towards the end of her paper). The thought is that, unlike other forms of restricted speech, hate speech expresses something like a comprehensive doctrine or a conception of the good. And it’s not the government’s role, one might think, to pass judgment on such conceptions by criminalizing their expression, no matter how vile.


Why not? Perhaps because restricting the dissemination of comprehensive doctrine undermines the formation of autonomous desire. This view commits one to a counterfactual account of the authentic self – the authentic you is the one that would have emerged in you had you been exposed to every viewpoint. The more such view points to which you’ve been exposed, the more authentic your desires are.


Critics, of course, could challenge the counterfactual account of the self (though that account is not entirely implausible). And they could point out that the dissemination of some viewpoints – i.e. those that count as hate speech – could undermine people’s ability to act on their authentic desires or their ability to live autonomous lives. On the consequentialist model, the autonomy-based benefits of having hate speech restrictions would have to be weighed against their autonomy-based costs, and it’s not obvious that the latter outweigh the former.


Brison appears to make this very argument. Her view is that, vis-à-vis autonomy, permitting hate speech does more harm than good. And I don’t think she’s especially drawn to a counterfactual view of the authentic self. Her view is perhaps the Razian view that autonomy requires having an adequate range of options, but it doesn’t require that every option be made available.


On a side note, one could conceivably argue that hate speech restrictions pose no danger to speaker autonomy because those who express such views do not hold them autonomously. On a Kantian or rationalistic view of autonomy, you can’t autonomously support immoral views.


Brison spends quite a bit of time examining various autonomy-based defenses of free speech and she points out that those defenses often leave out the harmful effects on autonomy of allowing people to engage in hate speech.


Consider Nagel: “The sovereignty of each person’s reason over his own beliefs and values requires than he be permitted to express them, expose them to the reaction of others, and defend them against objections. It also requires that he not be protected against exposure to views or arguments that might influence him in ways others deem pernicious, but that he have the responsibility to make up his own mind about whether to accept or reject them. Mental autonomy is restricted by shutting down both inputs and outputs.”


But can’t someone’s sovereignty over his beliefs be undermined by certain forms of speech just as by certain forms of conduct – especially if the speech is full of inaccuracies? And could one make the same argument in the case of action? Does my sovereignty over my beliefs and values require that I be permitted to do whatever I want?
