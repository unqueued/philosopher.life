title: 2018.11.11 - Prompted Introspection: Hearing Nothing

!! Describe what you hear when you hear nothing.

I've never heard nothing. There would be nothing to hear. It's like asking me to experience deafness. I can't turn the flood of percepts off; my left ear is autistically sensitive too (it's painful!). It turns out that even when you walk into specially made soundproofing rooms you will still hear your own body. Apparently, it is incredibly disorienting, and it would probably drive some people crazy. I would like to try.

In quiet moments, my mind (and sometimes inner voice) races, loops, branches, and rabbitholes. I can't turn those percepts off very easily. It requires focus or distraction to get me out.
