title: 2019.07.11 - Wiki Audit: Different Approach

I can see I'm missing stuff, though it should be in my snapshots. As I walk through this wiki in [[The Remodeling]], I'll need to keep a list of what's missing, hence: [[Wiki Audit: Dude, Where's My Tiddler?]].

Trying a different approach to [[dotfiles]] with a prefix. Hopefully, they will stay.

The code transclusion snippet is amazing. Alongside [[Commander]] and [[subl]], I've eliminated a good bit of handwork. This is my molecularizer. Further, I often need to change conventions, and I want to be able to go back and fix it. Just have to think about how to do it, and I ain't so good at that.

Hrm. Git went haywire. I am grateful to have such a rich zhist, lol.
