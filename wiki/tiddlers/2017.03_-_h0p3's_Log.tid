!! Audit:

* I started [[h0p3's Log]] officially this month. If you look through the snapshot archive in {[[Connect|Ways to Connect to this Wiki]]}, you will find many incarnations of this tool/log. I would make them, collapse them, attempt to categorize them, etc. It was definitely a period of yet more necessary wandering.<<ref "1">> That's kind of what this wiki is about. I'm specializing my tools though. This is a catchall area in which to grind when I don't have categories or specialized pages designed for the problem or thought at hand. It has an everydayness to it that I very much like. 
* Obviously, I didn't know what I was doing this month. That's okay though. I'm still learning how to use this wiki. I'm still formulating it. I'm glad I took the time to write something down. It allowed me to look ahead, to see what I needed, and to start building it.
* I wrote down what frustrated me. That's a start.
