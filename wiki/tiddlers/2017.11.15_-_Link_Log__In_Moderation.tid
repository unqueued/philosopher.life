* Stunning!

* KYS

*** Our system is not as centralized, but our oligarchic propaganda machine is just as real (and perhaps even more insidious in our inability to pin it down).
** https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonleopold/secret-finding-60-russian-payments-to-finance-election
*** Buzzfeed or not, this is dossier material.

*** Decentralize while you still can. The Network Effect is going to end us all.
** https://www.gq.com/story/all-the-bad-comedy-men
*** These philosophers made some huge mistakes. You are a fool for only seeing rhetoric.

*** KYS Sessions. My stomach still turns from your first hearing.

* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.historytoday.com/william-armstrong/sultan-and-sultan
*** Hypernormalization
** http://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/how-dogs-could-help-patients-with-hiv-live-longer
*** It's what I think of dog-owners.
** https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/15/men-and-women-interpret-the-sexual-intent-behind-dating-behaviours-very-differently/
*** I think there are differences between the sexes that can't be accounted for through conditioning. 

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/how-to-get-rich-playing-video-games-online
*** I'd never have enough to say that people would want to hear to do that. Still, neat.

* Think About It
** https://www.teenvogue.com/story/maxine-waters-impeach-45-speech-glamour-woty-2017
*** As wonderful as Aunty Maxine may be, this smacks of bullshit. 
** https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/firefox-features-google-as-default-search-provider-in-the-u-s-canada-hong-kong-and-taiwan/
*** With FF57/Quantum released with this, I'm confused, to say the least. I wish I understood.

** https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/14/business/dealbook/cashless-economy.html
*** I actually don't agree with these numbers, although I agree with much of the sentiment and argument. Someone has not told the truth or they've not understood what is meant by cashlessness. Why? What does this mean? Is this mere human error, or something more dangerous?
** https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-14/germany-is-burning-too-much-coal
*** I don't understand the move away from nuclear, but they go green so fast this won't hurt too much. I am confused still.

* Fishy
** https://futurism.com/drugs-rape-massacres-ai-exposing-children-worst-of-humanity/
*** I keep seeing this discussed, echo chamber.

* Interesting
** http://lic.nlp.cornell.edu/nlvr/
*** One of my logic teachers from Cornell (and he was truly an asshole, but I'm glad to have learned from him) used Barwise and Etchemendy's book that does this (only simpler).
** https://i.redd.it/hv65dlclouxz.jpg
*** We live in interesting times. I've never seen anything like that before.
