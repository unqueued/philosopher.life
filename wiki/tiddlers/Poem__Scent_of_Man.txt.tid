title: Poem: Scent of Man
type: text/plain

Your face smells like onions and your hands of lunchmeat.<br>
Even the ghosts of your farts haunt the room.<br>
You smell of sweat and like the milk at the back of the devil's fridge.<br>
Why can't you emit the fragrance of Cadbury cream eggs and brown sugar?<br>
