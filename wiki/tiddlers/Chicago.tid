I am still undecided about the extent to which I wish to fill this page. In a way, since I don't have memories of the place, I don't feel like it counts as mine. It's not that I didn't generate some autobiographic short-term memory during this time period, I just didn't retain it. Like any child that age, I didn't (and probably couldn't) rehearse my memories and practice self-story telling enough to keep a running stream-of-consciousness.<<ref "1">> In other words, I wasn't Dasein. Yet, despite that, I still see how this time period had significant impact on who I am, how I see the world and myself, etc. For example, I've long felt like cityfolk to people in rural areas and a redneck to people who live in cities. I'm a man with mixed geographic and cultural origins, it seems; this is a common story of people of my age group. Being so rootless and alien has also had profound drawbacks, but also several advantages. Hence, thinking about Chicago matters to me. 

Being born in Chicago is perhaps more than an odd factoid about me, but I'm also not sure what Chicago really means to me. I don't have memories of living in Chicago, but I have many memories concerned with the notion of Chicago and the fact of being from Chicago. It is part of my cultural heritage, I suppose. I'm not terribly attached to it in any normal sense. Clearly, I have more thinking to do on the matter.

!! Focus:

I was conceived because my female donor, [[SLT]], was allergic to latex. I was born in Chicago, IL in 1985. My brother, [[JRE]], was born 17 months later in the same hospital.<<ref "2">> We lived there until I was four. I have no first-hand knowledge of this time of my life. I've only heard stories and seen a few photographs. It is possible I have the faintest of memories, but even those are likely confabulated. Imho, I remember Chicago mostly from subsequent visits (mostly passing through on our way to visit SLT's family) while growing up as a child. I have fond memories of the ethnically divided areas of town. The food was always amazing, and it helped me understand humanity better.

My donors were students at the Moody Bible Institute. Oddly enough, our poorest and wealthiest moments occured in this time frame. Initially, we lived in Humboldt Park, a dangerous neighborhood. My male donor, [[MWF]], found a good-paying job as a maintenance manager of sorts. From what I understand, we had a good life. Here he made the giant mistake<<ref "3">> of going into ministry instead of staying to make a living to help his children be happy. Together, they both made the mistake of pursuing their own happiness (faith) instead of their children's happiness.<<ref "4">> Our lives would have been profoundly better had he chosen to just make money and rethink life. 

Eventually my donors moved us to Louisville to attend Southern Baptist Seminary, although there were some Tennessee+Texas excursions along the way. They claimed one of their motivations for moving away from Chicago was because of the poor school systems and worrying that their children would not benefit from magnet schools. Later, it becomes obvious they didn't care.
