title: 2019.01.11 - Prompted Introspection: Mother's Womb

!! What would you do if you could hide in your mother's womb?

What mother? Lol. [[JHBFC]], what kind of question is this, Samwise? I don't think I'd ever use this ability. Hrm. Or maybe I would. Am I teleporting and shrinking? I suppose the ability to shrink+teleport could be a useful power. I have no idea how to make use of it. More importantly, can I just teleport back? Can I dictate the spawn point of my teleport? How long is the teleport process? How much can I take with me? So much will be dictated by this information.

I'm pretty sure [[SLT]]'s uterus is not the bottomless bag. I guess I would be Mr. Frisby the teleporting uterine wizard. I'd have a carnival show, and I'd play amazing pranks on people, and I'd have a cool storage cabinet (she's through menopause, so that thing ain't terribly useful at this point). 

There appear to be free energy principles here. As usual, my retarded X-men kneejerk reaction to coherentifying the modification of contingent truths is kicking in. I cannot suspend my disbelief effectively enough.
