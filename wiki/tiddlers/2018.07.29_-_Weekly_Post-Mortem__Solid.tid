---

* m10 is better than she has ever been. I fucking love it.
* Children broke into several new frontiers and worked hard. I'm very proud.
* I did some reading and writing, but not as much as I'd have liked. Much of it was technical.
* I didn't do jackshit with IJ, but I have let my wife off the hook after she reads summaries and reviews. I want her to think about it.
