!! What do you think about repeating Prompted Introspections?

I accidentally did that. I didn't realize it until my wife pointed it out to me. I searched and found it. It turned out to be an interesting exercise, but I don't think it would be terribly valuable in the vast majority of cases. How do I know when it would be valuable? When my mind changes? How do I know when my mind has changed? Ok, I guess once in a while it wouldn't hurt. Review is necessary here. I would rather not though. I think there are plenty of new topics to explore.<<ref "2018.12.17">>

<<footnotes "2018.12.17" "Lol. Wow! It has been one of the catalysts to thinking about how to more effectively structure and search this wiki. I can see that repetition in [[Prompted Introspection]] is a gateway to practicing mining myself for information, examples, and storylines. This question makes me wish that I asked more direct questions of myself rather than always going off the list.">>
