title: 2017.06.15 - Carpe Diem Log

* Had a lot of dreams last night. They kept me up though. I woke up before my alarm clock which is a good thing since it wasn't even on.
** I tried giving my wife a good night of sleep without me snoring in the room since I knew she wasn't sleeping well. I eventually came back up, but I forgot to hit the alarm.
* I woke up before the alarm anyways for some fireman time. Lovely.
* I worked hard.
* I talked to a guy at lunch who plays magic and is into computers. He's a casual; he's young and dumb too, lol.
* I worked hard again. It was quite frustrating after lunch. We'll see if the teacher accepts it.
* I called my brother and talked to him. It sounds like he'll be having a good weekend. I talked to him about the job situation. He suggested I consider electrical work as well. 
** I've realized that I can't be picky at this point. I just need a decent paying job.
* I got home and talked to kids about their school work.
** I was really hoping to treat them with swimming tonight. Instead, they just lost steam. Their school work comes before all else. I really hope they learn to kick it out.
* I looked for jobs and for other unions in my area. 
** Unfortunately, I don't live in or near a very large city like Knoxville, Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, etc.
* I wrote the bulk of my wiki. 
** I'm saving my Carpe Diem Log for the end of the day. 
* I picked my wife up from work. My prediction about her period was correct. It's been tough on her.
* We made roast together for dinner tonight. It didn't finish cooking until much later.
* I had some more fireman time.
** Give me my pleasure chemicals!
* I watched two episodes of Game of Thrones with the kids!
** We've finished Season 4. Two more to knock out before the new season comes out this summer.
* I'm watching Delta Fox play LoL in the Challenger league. 
** I wish I got to hear their voice coms.
* I intended to get more work done, but I didn't. I'm going to chill and maybe knock another fireman session out before I fall asleep.
