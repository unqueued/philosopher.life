*** That is fucking hilarious.

*** Decentralize or perish.

*** Also, fascinating to see our fueling apartheid is coming back to us so directly. World class at it, right?

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://failedevolution.blogspot.com/2019/10/gaddafis-plan-for-pan-african.html
*** That part never occurred to me. As usual, I'm a dumb American.
** https://aeon.co/essays/how-ancient-poetry-can-revitalise-our-erotic-imaginations
*** You love porn, can't get enough of it, including erotic fiction. Why the fuck haven't you tried erotic poetry enough? What better way to dive into poetry than through one of the most irrational parts of your life, one you celebrate for virtuous irrationality?

* Think About It
** https://theamericanscholar.org/its-complicated/#.WUgzS1LMzv0
*** In my experience, the compatibilists often turn out to be incompatibilists in disguise. I've met very few people who believed in morality, metaethics, and agency all the way down though.

*** Of course, I think she's missing something crucial. I also don't think this counts as not having any notion of her history in an absolute fashion, but I suggest it is significantly degraded. Still something to think about as a wikiphile.

*** I keep running into it. I've commented on it before. Requiring comments will have unexpected results, but maybe we keep playing that game. I want scores based upon how I score others, and how their epistemic trust branches into the rhizome should be part of the calculation for what I see. They must be my lens. 
** https://www.the-utopian.org/post/53360513384/the-thirteen-commandments-of-neoliberalism
*** Excellent, but the commandments do not stand up to scrutiny in isolation. They weren't meant to though; they are headings.

* Fishy

*** Must figure out how to exploit spergs.

*** Yikes. They were hunting for writers on this topic; neo-rationalism is so trendy (they'll make us money ;P). Lawdy, there's a lot of missing pieces. They don't even know how to define altruism. The dirty secret is that even consequentialism still rides on those limbic processes; you have no meaningful calculus without it (and that's just on materialist grounds; wait until we hit moral realism, you are in so much trouble). Further, those deontic flash-responses can be conditioned through reason. It's a dialectic. Let me also point out that plenty of utilitarians I've met have all the flaws of consequentialism (I'm looking at you, Anti-realist Neo-Aristotelians `/mean mug`), including psychological egoism biases and higher rates of sociopathy. I despise watching psychologists masquerade as philosophers, lol.
