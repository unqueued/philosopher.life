Odd Thoughts on Murray’s Memory in Deontology and Descartes’ Demon

The second Murray case is not as clear as I would like. I don’t see how it necessarily does all of the work Weatherson thinks it does.

In the second case, I can see how Murray did something wrong earlier. Working on one’s character or dispositions, at least insofar as they are about beliefs, is a kind of indirect doxastic voluntarism. I can understand how one might blameworthy or praiseworthy for these. I don’t see how Murray obviously did something wrong at the time he swore.

Consider the phrase: “he could have kept his resolution, had only he thought of it” (8). I think the claim is that Murray is somehow responsible for remembering and forgetting his commitment.

I’m forced to ask: In what cases and to what degree can a person be responsible for remembering and forgetting?

Maybe in some cases, I can be. If I don’t have any way to record your address at the time you give it to me, and I must remember it as I run to get a piece of paper to write it down, and I am actually capable of remembering it for that duration, and I have a duty to remember it, then I can be praised or blamed for remembering it while I get a piece of paper to write it down. I can be intentionally focused on remembering your address while I get a piece of a paper, and remember or forgetting is “up to me.” I might choose to start doubling numbers in my head (which I know will eventually take all of my concentration, and result in forgetting your address) before I find a piece of paper, and in that case I could be blamed for forgetting. Likewise, if I directly found a piece of paper and wrote your address down, I can be praised for remembering.

Maybe in some cases, however, I can’t be held responsible for remembering and forgetting. I remember bits of random information all the time that I didn’t intend to remember – believe me, there things I wish I could force myself to forget. Likewise, there are times when I forget things, and my forgetting just wasn’t up to me. Back to the address example, if I was on my way to find a piece of paper, and I found my daughter was choking on a grape (let’s say I wasn’t responsible for this, for the sake of argument), I would probably forget your address while racing to help my daughter. I may, by some miracle, coincidentally remember your number after helping my daughter, but that wasn’t up to me either. In this kind of case, I don’t see how I can be blamed for forgetting or remembering. Note that we need not have such a provocative explanation for accidentally forgetting or remembering. For example, I may not have had a duty to remember your address, so why should I be blamed for forgetting it? Further, I am a finite human, with only so much brain power, and as I get older, I find I forget many things all the time that I had really hoped to remember, often temporarily, as in the case of Murray. I can easily see a temporary forgetfulness as either being outside Murray’s control or not actually his duty.

When Murray temporarily forgets, there seem to be ways in which he could be responsible and other ways in which he would not be responsible. It wasn’t evident from the example that he was obviously responsible for remembering his commitment. Perhaps we were just supposed to assume he was responsible for remembering, I don’t know. Further, we might say that embedded in the word ‘commitment’ is that you can only culpably forget it and that you have a duty to remember it. That isn’t so obvious to me either though.

Lastly, I want to point out there seems to be two possible instances of self-control in the second example. The first is the possibility of self-control over remembering the commitment, and the second would be that even if Murray remembered, he would have a self-controlled choice about whether or not to fulfill his commitment.





Weatherson offers us an example of a man, a cricket captain, who deserves praise for his non-volitional act of imagination. How can a person be responsible for that which is beyond his volition? Those non-volition acts, such as catching a fast moving ball (muscle memory, instinct, etc.), have origins, either by nature or by nurture. By nature, I see no responsible agents in non-volitional acts. By nurture, I see the responsibility as resting upon the nurturers in non-volitional acts. As I hope to point out, I have strong worries about how Weatherson employs the concept of responsibility (praiseworthiness and blameworthiness).

In his first false rebuttal to the captain example, Weatherson offers the claim that Mother Nature, presumably a non-agent, could be praised for the captain’s act of imagination. He refutes with the claim that this is dehumanizing to the captain. I don’t see how. It seems reasonable to think that some people are genetically more intellectually capable than others, and that would seem to include the capacity of imagination. If this is the captain’s case, then the Captain is clearly not responsible for how imaginative he was, and in that respect he cannot be praised. Further, to claim that a non-agent, Mother Nature in this case, could be praised or blamed at all, as Weatherson goes on to suggest, is a problem. Mother Nature isn’t an agent and isn’t responsible for anything, and so if we explain the captain’s act of imagination in terms of Mother Nature, I don’t see how there is praise at all.

In his second false rebuttal to the captain example, Weatherson offers the claim that the captain is indirectly praiseworthy for his act of imagination because he studied the game. Weatherson refutes this with the example of a hard-working dullard who also deserves equal praise for his studying while not achieving the same results as the captain. This offering of equal praise does seem right to Weatherson. Presumably, the dullard has done all the same work that the captain has in developing mind and learning the game theory behind cricket, and yet the dullard can’t achieve the same results as the captain. Weatherson wishes to praise the captain for his results never-the-less. This seems to me just another case of the first rebuttal. The dullard and the captain had different genetic circumstances. It makes sense to praise only that for which they are responsible, namely the hard work, and not their genetics. If the dullard and captain were genetic equals, then my response would be that either the dullard really hasn’t done the same hard work in developing his mind and learning the game (and is thus not as praiseworthy as the captain) or the dullard did not receive the same quality of nurturing from other agents as the captain did (at which point, the dullard may be just as praiseworthy).



I think the false rebuttals may point toward why Weatherson has a skewed conception of responsibility. I think his intuition about this example is that when something “good” occurs (such as an imaginative and successful field placement), we should necessarily praise the cause of that good for causing that good. This is why Mother Nature (and the captain) should be praised.

I can agree that the good (or instances or part of it) is always desirable, and presumably, the causes of the good might also be desirable. But, desiring is different from praising. Good things occur all the time for which no agent is responsible, and in such cases, there is desirability but no responsibility.

My claim runs counter to what I believe is Weatherson’s intuition: when something good occurs, it or its causes may be things which should be desired, but they aren’t necessarily things which should be praised. In conflating desirability with responsibility, Weatherson is sometimes attributing responsibility where is there is only desirability.





A lot of what was going on in pages 21 and 22 bothered me as well.

My initial question was something like: Why should we think Praise and Blame can be peeled apart? As far as I can tell, they are opposite sides of the same coin: responsibility. If a situation is one which you can possibly be praised, then you must also possibly be blamed, and vice versa. That space that Weatherson wishes to claim exists between praise and blame is the Good.

I think the major problem is that Weatherson is conflating or confusing the Good (what is desirable) and the Right (what you are responsible for). “To be a good epistemic agent” is parallel to “being a good human.” Being a good human takes more than merely right action (or having the right character, being virtuous, or whatever), it requires a kind of luck, being in a set of circumstances that enables you to partake of the human good. For example, a starving person isn’t fully partaking of the human good (you would say they aren't achieving eudaimonia), but this may not be an issue of “should" or "ought,” as perhaps the starving person has no choice in the matter. Good and Right are distinct; the former is an object of desire, and the latter an object of responsibility.

So, on page 21, I agree that we should evaluate B and C as being epistemically blameless. We should evaluate C as partaking of the good more than B. But, partaking of the good is different from right action and being responsible. C is no more praiseworthy than B, C merely has something more desirable than B.

Further, it isn’t so clear that the second pond-diver is not to be praised as much as the first (22). If the second pond-diver would have saved drowning children had they been there, then I see his action, and essentially, his intention as being just as praiseworthy as the first pond-diver. Now, is there a difference between who brought about more good in the world? Yes. That is merely circumstantial though, and it does not reflect on moral responsibility, praiseworthiness, or blameworthiness.

So, there are two senses of being a "better epistemic agent." The first is about partaking of (epistemic?) good, about what is desirable, without respect to responsibility. The second is distinctly about epistemic responsibility, about "ought" and "should."
