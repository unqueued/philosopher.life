Am I meditating in the morning? I do not know how to define meditation. I still haven't studied it enough. I have strong opinions about particular aspects of it. I cannot give a satisfactory account to myself.

There are different [[dok]] of meditation. Perhaps I'm taking one approach. I should try and study them all. How can I be empirical about this? What am I looking for? What's the goal. It is very hard to calm my frenetic mind. Should I silence myself?
