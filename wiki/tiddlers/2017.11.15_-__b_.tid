If you're well off and a communist you'll get called a hypocrite.
If you're struggling and a communist they'll claim you're jealous
If you're young they'll call you naive.
If you're old they'll claim you're out of touch
If you went to Uni they'll say you're indoctrinated.
If you went to work they'll claim you're uneducated
