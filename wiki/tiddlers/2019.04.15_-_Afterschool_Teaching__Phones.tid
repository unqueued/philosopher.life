title: 2019.04.15 - Afterschool Teaching: Phones

5AB talked about testing, and we considered the reasons they were being tested. He was feeling stressed about it, and I don't want him to feel stress unnecessarily. 

Mitchell, Delp, and Whitney discussed what we'd do if state shows up, since there is almost no homework and these kids were worn out from testing. I took almost everyone to the library, some a few stayed behind in the cafeteria to play chess. Whitney played in the office, but would check in on the library and then run back to Delp talking about the fact that the kids (who she wasn't working with at all) were using phones. Delp, of course, has commanded us to just start taking up the phones. 

If these were my kids, and they were being babysat after a long day of testing and had no schoolwork, I'd want them to be able to use their phones. I'm not going to implement a policy I don't agree with, and I know that arguing with evil people is irrelevant in this case. It's passive and deceptive, and it's also my duty. The kids deserve a break and to use their technology. 

I had lots of kids who were reading, some playing with gak/goop, some who decided to play chess in the library instead, and lots of conversations. Eventually, the gym opened up.

Delp asked about 6CM's uncle to see if I noticed he was a meth user by his arms. He was proud of the fact that he picks out meth users often. A discussion of drug use ensued.
