As always, Hermione and I would have been homies. Fine with SPEW =). 

My wife disagrees on the Dobby Jarjar comparison. I think it's partially there.

Dobby's fierceness, loyalty, and goodwill is real though. Grateful for owning clothes becomes actually cute. It's weird that it's cute, right?

Of course, sexual tension is made explicit in this book.

Anglophilia makes this book more fun. Mince pies and shit.

Percy lives up to his name.
