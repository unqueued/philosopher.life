* Continue hunting for blackwolf
** Do not worry your brother ;P
* Keep smashing through your letters.
** You are doing a good job.
* Give thought to how to solve the day-based versioning problem. Both [[kicks]] and [[Sphygmus]] have asked for it.
** It's an obvious problem I need to fix. The best solution isn't obvious.
* Work
* You have many books to get through.
* Finish scripts for [[Sphygmus]] and others. 
* Consider giving Adam a tap on the shoulder. I'm not sure how close he is watching (and quite reasonably, he may not be).
* I'd really like to see those plugins integrated. The wiki needs those functions.
* Eventually, I'd like to see text substitution scripting integrated into the wiki...otherwise, my browser extensions need to be updated. Some are amazingly useful (I hate writing on my phone by comparison, even with a fully keyboard).
* Walk with wife?
** She really just might not be up to it. She doesn't seem to be fully over her flu.
* A game of magic would be nice.
* Encourage your daughter to complete passthrough so she can do her art in a windows VM empowered by her GPU.
* Encourage your son to continue letter writing.
