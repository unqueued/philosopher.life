I've been a teacher many times. Schools are one of the few social contexts that at least pay indirect lipservice to philosophy. To some non-trivial (but usually wildly incomplete) [[dok]], I get to be myself in a school. Finding a fitting place in society for an autist like me ain't easy. This is a job which I can at least respect at face value; I relish the opportunity to be able to look at myself in the mirror at the end of the day without disgust. Education is profoundly about respecting [[The Other]], and I hope to do good work [[irwartfrr]] in my context here.

It's time to ~~brainwash~~ habituate virtue in children with the truth (especially that which no one else can give them). It may pay slave wages and the system is filled with human garbage, but there may be a few [[diamond]]s in the rough (you cannot know). As always, you owe Humanity your best. Get after it, boi! Give these kids the chance you never had.

As I have [[noted before|2017.02.19 - Realpolitik Speculation: The American Education System]], public schools are prison daycare centers designed to: enable capitalists to exploit both parents in the workforce, institutionalize an army of reserve labor, and contain memetic uprising against the centralization of power by purposely failing to offer complete educations to the margins. In this case, as my brother [[JRE]] has pointed out, I should aim to be a moral and subversive prisonguard babysitter.

!! Principles:

* Be a moral teacher even if that means you lose your job.
* Treat your students as your own children behind mountains of red tape enforced by bureaucratic enemies of their minds.
* Be quiet and listen: it's the only way you can code with these people.
* Encode names as YFL#mfx.
