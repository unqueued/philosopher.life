!! Audit:

* These past couple months have been rough on this log. That's okay. I have more important things to do. I can't do everything I want; it's just not possible.
* This project makes me wish I had a much nicer computer and internet connection.
** It makes me wish I had a few people working with me on my wiki too.
* I think I've been too hard on myself. I'm holding myself to an insanely high standard here. Relaxing that just a bit would do me some good.
* It's obvious how reliant I am upon [[monster-10]] and my browser tooling to accomplish these tasks.
* It is clear to me that these [[Log Audit]]s have had a direct impact on //About://(Link Log). Neat. I wish all my logs could do that.
* I feel like I'm failing my children in this practice. [[Hyperread]]ing has partially fallen off the map (except for work and braincandy).
** I need to fix this. I want my children to build this kind of thing as well.
