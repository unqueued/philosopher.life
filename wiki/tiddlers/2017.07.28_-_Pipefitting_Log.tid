title: 2017.07.28 - Pipefitting Log

I arrived early. I edited yesterday's pipefitting log in the car since I forgot some stuff. Jaye and Bull showed up at the same time. Spaz is in Florida. I wrote a bit more and then got my gear all set.

Bull seems more standoffish today to me. Jaye brought it up as well. I'm not sure what is up.

We had a drop cord get chewed or burned up yesterday. Bull wasn't happy about it, and when we tested it today, it failed. Drop cords don't live long here (or they get stolen).

Jaye and I talked about the comments we received on our work. My flange isn't halfway, and the slag came outside. This is considered my fault, but after the slag was removed it was fine. Further, they don't like when Jaye sits to weld, but this is dumb, imho. Sitting comfortably is extremely valuable (that's like welding 101). Jaye isn't lazy, no sir. He is doing it the right way. They don't seem to like that. 

We mounted the Return pipe in Room #1. It wasn't easy. Interestingly, the Supply pipe became unlevel overnight. It raised up off our hangar! I don't understand how. But, I feel better than the pipe on the other side of mine is not level to the same degree. It can't be simply me.

We started working Room #2's bottom pipe work again. There's no way we can hang it though. There's no scaffold. I may just continue to fab pipe if we don't have the right safety equipment. I feel like we already taking risks that I said I'd never take.

We finished up the pipe for Room #2, at least on the bottom. I asked for help mounting the threaded flanges on the roof. Jaye fucked it up badly, and he left. I needed his counterweight. I need to develop a better relationship of trust and understand with my welder. 

Jaye was off today. He felt racially harassed by Bull, I believe. Bull seems cool enough with me, but he isn't fair towards Jaye, imho. Bull claimed that he disliked when welders sat down to weld, as Jaye had been doing. Jaye's cinder block seats were disappearing. Ironically, Bull was using cinderblocks to sit on while welding all day today. I think this is hypocritical. As cool as Bull might be with me, I can't trust him.

I had talked to Bull about his threadolet nipples. This was an inventive tool. He joked about patenting them. I found them useful today, yet again. I decided to show him my flange wrench at the end of day. I showed him what I had made. He "liked it" so much he asked to borrow it for the weekend since he would be installing flanges all weekend. I think he was just being friendly about it. The wrench has a nice heft and size, but my bolts aren't ribbed to catch.
