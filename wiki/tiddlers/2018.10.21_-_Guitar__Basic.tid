title: 2018.10.21 - Guitar: Basic

I just went through a basic practice so I'm not losing ground. I'm tilting my guitar up higher. My back hurts a bit when I play. I'm fat. Lol. There is no reason for me not to be able to hold this posture, though perhaps I'm doing it wrong (I'm betting on my weight). 

Today my son and I played for my wife during family time. My daughter turned down presenting.
