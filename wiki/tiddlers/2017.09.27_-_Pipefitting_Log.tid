title: 2017.09.27 - Pipefitting Log

I arrived a few minutes later, but still with plenty of time to spare. My table is now filled up.

Dave told me he regretted his phrasing yesterday, and that I obviously am a hard worker.

I set up and did the layout for adding a rigging point to the flange and cutting the trunion saddle again. 

We had no fire watch. 

!! Break!

I cut the saddle.

I fit the rigging piece on the other large saddle flange.

I measured with and after Chris-M on whether or not that spool will fit the riser. Chris-M's measurement was off by 6 inches. He immediately trusts mine. He did this before on the saddle we cut. He got the measurements wrong but took mine.

!! Lunch!

We fit up the saddle flange, but the piece was a quarter of an inch in the way of dropping it down. So, we cut that piece out.

I helped draw more measurements up top, and I voiced my worry that the angle may be off.

I told Sam, since he asked earlier, that the underground pipe is 20 inches OD.

We muscled our risers for the trunnion supports in and out. I was able to do half the rigging today, including the signaling.

I need to take a picture of that book 1000 ordinates of whatever. It doesn't matter how rarely we use it, I need to know.

!! Break!

I did some grind work in the riser. I still need to widen it as Dave pointed out. I explained that we needed scaffolding to reach around it. He thinks we will have the crane fit it up tomorrow morning. Uhhh...I don't see how, at least not the first thing, as he claimed.
