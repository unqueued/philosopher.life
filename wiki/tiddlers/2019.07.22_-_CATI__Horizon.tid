title: 2019.07.22 - CATI: Horizon

The idealists conflate ideality and materiality. Representations of materiality, of course, have to found in [[The Infinite]] (likely an infinite number of such tokens). The horizon of where ideality fleshes out into materiality appears to obtain. I have no idea how to talk about what that is. That is a giant leap, and I have no idea how to prevent the conflation.
