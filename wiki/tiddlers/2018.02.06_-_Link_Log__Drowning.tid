*** I disagree on replacement; I see value in thinking about the theory of leftism and rightism. However, the general notion here, I agree to.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/health/colon-cancer-bacteria.html
*** I continue to be amazed to the point of ceding ground to the sheer influence of gut biom in my identity. They shape me physiologically in ways I just didn't realize, and clearly, they have psychological effects as well.

* Think About It
** https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/?single_page=true
*** Actually, I was thinking just the opposite. In researching shadowsocks and openwrt + pfense virtualization, I relied heavily upon google's translation of Chinese and Russian. Yeah, it wasn't perfect, but this has been incredibly useful to me. If you are willing to glean and digest, it is remarkably useful. I realize, of course, it won't be translating my wiki any time soon.
** https://thewire.in/217773/india-systematic-destruction/
*** Quite a bit to digest. The links at the end only add to the complexity of it.
** http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42905515
*** AI will have whatever bias we give it. You will be shocked by what it does (and, it benefits corporations that NN's are a blackbox we can't reverse engineer, since this allows them to unleash themselves and disregard their moral responsibility; they'll just point to the blackbox).

* Fishy
** https://squawker.org/analysis/understanding-the-alt-rights-strange-approval-of-miscegenation/
*** Why is this so brief?
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16311918
*** Excellent discussion which is unfish-related in a sense. Google's shaping of the web is not to our benefit. Remember that.

*** You should be a metaanalysis, microhistory, and historiography collector. This is a long-term project you should engage in over the next 3 decades. You will have a story of stories of stories that must be understood.
