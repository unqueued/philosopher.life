title: 1uxb0x: Grandmaster Electrician

My son went to a science fair, and he was ecstatic about building a circuit there. He has the chops to be an electrician, and it sounds like he would really enjoy it. Plus, it's a damned good way to make money. This will be incredibly useful to him, and it will be a source of immense happiness.

He will be a college-educated electrician. It will open many doors for him.

* Redstone Minecraft Circuitry Design
** Have fun building things and understanding the nature of circuity in an intuitive and visual way. Build a solid foundation for reasoning about electricity.

Schedule:

* Spend 30 Minutes reading or watching about it.
* Spend 30 Minutes building something.
