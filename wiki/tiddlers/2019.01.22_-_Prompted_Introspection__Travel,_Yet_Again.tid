title: 2019.01.22 - Prompted Introspection: Travel, Yet Again

!! If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and what would you do?

I have many of the same question. It must be an important one. I cited it yesterday, and I'll cite it again today:

* [[2018.11.24 - Prompted Introspection: Travel Wish. Again.]]

That sequence of events which maximizes utility, Lady Melisandre. You are free to give me the algorithm, and I'll compute it in the world. Of course, such a sequence includes that which is necessary to prove to me that I should trust the rest of the sequence. Good luck!

This is the kind of question I'm going to need to weed out to some extent. It shows up far too often, it doesn't seem relevant enough, and it doesn't produce results that matter (besides forcing me to search).
