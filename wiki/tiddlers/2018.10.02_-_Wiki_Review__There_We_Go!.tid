** Yet, plenty of comments.
* [[Littlest Lovecraft: The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]
** Gonna go through these and get a feel.
* [[2018.10.01 - Deep Reading: The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]
** And, it's okay that I don't know. I can't know everything.
* [[2018.09.30 - Prompted Introspection: Learn A New Language]]

** This has been a rough month.
* [[2018.09 - Wiki Review]]
** Huge grammar errors. My ~~sentences~~ fragments are incoherent.
* [[2018.09 - Prompted Introspection]]
** A joy to read. No one ever mentions this section of my wiki besides my children.
* [[2018.10.01 - Reddit: Stabilizing]]
** Is this complacency?
* [[2018.09 - /b/]]
** It's a good thing that I've found where to put things.
* [[2018.10.01 - Tagging: The Audit]]
** But, why not just build those threads in tiddlers themselves? I still don't see it!

** No idea how to generate a relationship where we talk about real things.
* [[2018.10.01 - L&K: Checking In]]

* [[2018.09.30 - L: Oops]]
** I need to setup another time with her.
* [[2018.10.01 - Jop: Books]]
** I need to think more carefully about how I demonstrate my feelings of verbal inadequacy. There is something wrong in me here. It's really obvious to anyone with enough skill to see the imbalance.
