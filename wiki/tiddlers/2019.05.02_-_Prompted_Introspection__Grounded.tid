title: 2019.05.02 - Prompted Introspection: Grounded

!! Tell about a time when you were grounded.

Groundings were not common. Escalation went straight into violence often enough. I think they had no interest in spending significant amounts of time with us, and they weren't going to punish themselves by putting up with grounded children sufficient enough to use this tool.

I could forgive the violence if it actually served a meaningful purpose and they walked on the appropriate eggshells when it didn't. Of course, the definition of meaningful purpose is going to take some serious wrestling, and we have different understandings of our history.
