My brother had a bad day. He's been having difficulty with his bosses. My brother is honest to his detriment. He came home and took a depression nap. He names it quickly. 

We talked about a news event about an black, gay actor who claimed he had been beaten up, but had set it up; this event, of course, is something a conservative would eat up. It made the rounds in the lunch circle. My brother is the voice of reason in a sea of stupidity. One of his apprentices claimed 35% of females who accuse someone of rape are lying. This is insane, and my brother corrected it. I have no idea how he knows the actual statistics on these.

We talked about [[K]]'s method of reaching out to people and [[L]]'s letter. 

He had some heater trouble, and a guy came out to check the heater (turned out to be a grounding issue) and the AC. He was upset with himself for not having had the meter to make the determination himself, but checking the AC may have saved him from people trying to convince him (unjustifiably) to replace it.

He's going to be able to try LSD again tomorrow! Rebecca won't be joining him. He is bummed. =/
