Dear Sho,

I'm feeling happy to write a letter to you. I'm not sure what to put in it, which I find is happening more and more to me these days. I think it's awesome that you want to move to long-form communications though. You do that with my wife, and I think it's such a good idea. It's not that I don't like instant messaging (there's a time and a place for it), but I just don't 

I tried subbing to https://reddit.com/r/economics (only click if you have some substances nearby to revive you!), but the comments make me want to puke. Are you a fan of any [[forums|Reddit Theory & Practice]]? Sometimes it can be long-form as well.

I am, of course, grateful to have the chance to be one of your weirdo friends. I am often called a weirdo, but it makes me giggle to hear it coming from you.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
