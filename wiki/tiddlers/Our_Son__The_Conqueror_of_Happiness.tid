title: Our Son: The Conqueror of Happiness

//We love you! We love you to the core of who you are. You are our creation. As your creators, we are not your God. We are just your parents. We are fallible mammals swept by the maelstrom of time. Just like your creators, you are caught in this web of life and reality. We have a dream for you://

```
He wisely loves himself. 
He takes life and the world by the horns. 
He conquers himself. 
He is his own master. 
He knows who he is. 
He takes measured pride in himself, his abilities, and his tools.
He is good. 
He seeks to be and do what is right.
He does his best. 
He practices and habituates his virtue.
He yearns and hopes.
He plans and practices.
He takes the means to his ends.
He builds, hunts, and cultivates.
He fights when he must, but forgives himself and others when he can.
He searches, struggles, and wrestles.
He converts practice into theory.
He masters.
He compassionately tames and harnesses himself.
He captures the world around him.
He is a man, a //homo sapien//. 
He is as excellent as he can be.
He is his own beautiful, amazing entity. 
He seizes it.
He conquers happiness.
He flourishes.
