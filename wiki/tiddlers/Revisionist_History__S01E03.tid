The belief+threshold theory is very poorly argued from a philosophical standpoint. Forgive my skepticism. The argument is that thresholds are external to us, but he fails to relate this to our internal states. I grant, external inputs influence us, obviously, but what is more important is understanding that there is a complexity to our internal states which interpret and act upon these thresholds. In other words, thresholds just are beliefs. They are complex beliefs.

Essentially, the problem with the way this "Threshold" theory is presented is that it fails to reduce down to beliefs. Beliefs are logic gates in our brains. The logic behind that threshold must be represented and acted upon internally. Our "threshold" reasons just are a set of beliefs. 

The famous granny shot free throw problem might demonstrate that we are irrational with respect to perfect freethrows, but perhaps not irrational in general, in a social context, for instance. Perhaps appearing like a sissy will cost you more than you get for having sunk all your freethrows. 

There is a kind of lack of "empathy" for others perspectives when we take the objectively rational point of view. We take their irrational reasons not to be reasons for us. Gladwell claims it is perfectionism. God damn, he missed the boat, yet again. 

Gladwell clearly picks up on philosophically fascinating issues, but his understanding of them is so poor sometimes. I am blown away.
