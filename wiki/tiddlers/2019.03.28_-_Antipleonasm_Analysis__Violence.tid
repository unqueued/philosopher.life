title: 2019.03.28 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Violence

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Roughly speaking, states are violent to the extent that they have the power to act in the interests of those with domestic power...
<<<

That is a fine start to the issue. I will point out how this isn't conceptually necessary. The material dialectic does appear to follow that principle in general though. 

As we become globalized, and as the elite become transnational, able to buy citizenship or virtual citizenship, avoid paying taxes, live above the law, and collectively (however competitively and non-cooperatively with each other) impose their will on the rest of the world, the harder it is to talk about domestic power as being all that domestic. It appears that a tiny percentage of the world dictates how states, institutions, and indirectly the masses employ violence to a significant degree.

I agree that most violence is committed in the virtue of how it benefits those in power. Most everything is tainted by how it benefits those in power though. It is possible (maybe even likely) [[Saint Chomsky]] and I may part ways on anarchism. I am convinced that justified coercion and justified states can be much richer in concept and implementation than I've generally found in his work (but, I am not well-read here). Decentralizing the control of governments is exactly what I'm seeking.

Representation is a profound word to me. That's exactly what we have to do in both the thought-experiment and technopolitical implementation of [[TOP]]. Representing [[others]] is fundamental to exercising [[The Golden Rule]]. In this way, governments ought to serve the interests of domestic power, but that power has to be fundamentally decentralized [[irwartfrr]].
