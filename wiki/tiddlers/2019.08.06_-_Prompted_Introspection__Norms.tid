title: 2019.08.06 - Prompted Introspection: Norms

!! What is your opinion of someone who has bad manners?

Samwise, your question is ambiguously worded.<<ref "p">> Bless your heart. Assuming I knew (a large assumption because I'm autistic), I'd opine: they have bad manners given whatever standard in the context we're thinking about. Shocking! You see, Samwise, homie, social conventions look like mere rules I must empirically peel apart most of the time.<<ref "t">> Some people make distinctions between different kinds of normativity, and I can certainly play their simulated game here to some [[dok]]. There is only ONE normativity though, the normativity of all norms. That is all that matters by definition. You do not give me enough information to say much more.

Take my friend [[chameleon]]. She's terrifyingly abnormal by common standards (perilously beautiful). Sociologists will tag her as deviant on many bellcurves. She's one of them ~~persons~~ weebs the normies warned you about. In the eyes of so many I hold in contempt, her existence, apparently, is a form of bad manners (which is so hard to fathom).<<ref "i">> Fuck that. Her weirdness is [[beautiful]] to me. Her honesty is breathtaking, hilarious, and insightful. That's what I aim to defend and cultivate. Yup. That muh tribe, yo. I have told [[kickscondor]] he's cherrypicking;<<ref "f">> indeed, I wish there were billions of such weird, "bad mannered" people in the world. Far too often these [[gems]] pass the [[CI]] even if they aren't accepted by social conventions. It's the only test which matters.

I direct you to the is/ought distinction yet again, Sir Hume. I'm coming for you, גולם‎.
