title: 2018.07.31 - BAGD: Record Yourself

I need to start recording my lectures with my children. I need to start working on my wiki as I talk to them. I need to have the conversation become even more alive. I do this to some extent, but now I must do it explicitly. 

This is the socratic method.

---

You want to use your wikis to make friends. Find deep, honest, open, profound, systematic, integrated relationships.

We are going to learn to have deep relationships from afar, digitally, radically.

Let's make our memetic tentacles have length, breadth, details, profound programmatic expressivity, high-empathy tools. Let us abstractly reach out to understand each other profoundly. I love you.

Show me you control your wikis. Show me love yourselves and have tamed yourselves. Be your own master through your wiki. Show me, demonstrate your hard work, demonstrate your self-mastery. Show me that you are autonomous.

You must be the man who figures it out.
