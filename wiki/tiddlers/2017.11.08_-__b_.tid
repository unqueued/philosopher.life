You think fat girls have it hard/bad? Try being a lowerclass man who doesn't meet social expectations. I hear the Kantian defenses of these women, but not men. Be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlefolk. The Alt-Right is fueled by people who have bought both the redpill description and prescription. You have failed to empathize with those that you don't benefit from (a non-trivial percentage of men), and they are coming for you. I look in horror at all sides. Almost all of you are despicable. 

The expulsion of /r/Incels will only push them into darker corners. That is a mistake. I'm always blown away by the hate they get. Have you looked charitably at their arguments? I definitely despise much of Tumblrina-ism, but I have the integrity to point out where they are obviously correct. Can you not do the same for neckbeards and incels? 

All too often, psychopathy begets psychopathy, particularly on a grand scale. 

I do not feel bad for most of you who suffer. You deserve it. You have not even tried to think of others for yourself. The game is over. 

Here I feel like ALM's brother. He might be able to hear what I'm talking about. 

Being attractive does not make you right. Meeting social expectations doesn't make you right. You obviously have no idea how these behaviors and people are rewarded and punished. You need more redpills. Without the fitting description, you will never understand your own hypocrisy.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: in capitalism, those who compete with their moral gloves on will never maintain a competitive advantage to those who don't play the moral rules. By definition, in the evolutionary, survival of the fittest marketplace of human commerce, you will not maintain stable businesses that are moral. Building moral businesses requires moral regulation. Nothing else will work...regulation, of course, is nigh impossible in our context. It doesn't seem like those in power would ever subject themselves to it, nor that we will actually enforce such measures collectively.

Our oligarchy is a government of the donors by the donors and for the donors (or worse).

Capitalism naturally creates organizations with internal cooperation of egoistic creatures. They cooperate insofar as it seems to serve their best interest. Large cooperative structures do emerge from this. And, given the survival of fittest, those organizations which tend to have higher degrees of cooperation are more likely to have a comparative advantage; thus, capitalism induces or incentives and generates higher cooperative structures within corporations to maintain fitness. However, this cooperation is not necessarily to the benefit of the world, although there are obvious benefits. And, of course, that doesn't mean that capitalism generates efficient cooperation. Game theory demonstrates this pretty obviously.

Remove the vulnerability of physical proximity, and your overlords can do much greater harm to you. Globalization has its perks, but this is one giant buttfuck.
