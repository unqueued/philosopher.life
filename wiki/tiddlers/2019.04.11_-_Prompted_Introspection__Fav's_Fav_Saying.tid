My love says //Blargle//. I don't remember where or when she picked it up. It has a kind of onomatopoeia to it. It's a word you ejaculate abruptly with a hint of vocal fry in some kind of silly frustration. I think it has some qualities of [[Anomianisms]] because it's a fantastical madeup gobbledygook word which still pushes meaning to us, however blurry it may be.
