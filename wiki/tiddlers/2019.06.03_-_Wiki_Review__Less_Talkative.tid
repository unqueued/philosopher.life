title: 2019.06.03 - Wiki Review: Less Talkative

* [[2019.06.02 - Sphygmus: BRAAAIIIIINNNNSSS]]
** Reminds me of a pulse. =)
* [[2019.05.29 - Tasha: Crit]]
** I assume my offspring will live with us until they are in their 30's. I hope I won't be a stickler. 
*** Most people find I'm incredibly judgmental, but it's usually isolated to a particular set of spheres (or implications to them).
* [[2019.06.02 - Tasha: Gift]]
** That was kind of her. It was unexpected. I hate to say it, but we never have anything extra to give to our neighbors. There's rarely any used goods or food that get wasted with us.

** Seems like he's dropping off the map during the summer a bit.
* [[2019.05.29 - JRE: Gud]]
** It's cool to see him take a recommendation from me. It's almost always the other way around, but I'm especially bad at recommending things to others which they love. 
* [[2019.05.30 - JRE: Strop]]
** I was disappointed to see the electricians didn't appreciate the craftsmanship. They don't really have a lot of sculpting like fitters though.
* [[2019.05.29 - AA: Halpert]]
** A surprising use of his name. I wonder why the conversation cut short there. Why didn't she continue?
* [[2019.05.28 - AA: Classical]]
** Expertise is contextual. I would not call myself an expert in academia whatsoever. I'm decent enough that an expert can reasonably teach down to me though.
* [[2019.06.01 - AA: Fluff]]
** I wonder what she considers to be non-fluff of her own writing.
* [[2019.05.30 - T-Money: Dumb Shit We Say Matters]]
** I am not a safe space. I don't find anyone else is a safe space for me either, and I'm tired of it.
* [[2019.05.30 - L: Ghost Again]]
** [[Reply Mode]] is well-deserved. I continue to have evidence of it. I just need to own up to 6 years of evidence, lol. 
* [[2019.05.27 - Jop: 5k]]
** I hope the kids take a page out of her book on this one. Melissa seems like she will need it more.
* [[2019.06.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Disintegrated]]
** Completed. Yesterday was good until it wasn't. It wasn't fully lost though.
* [[2019.06.02 - TDL: Eat]]
** Edited. Clearing everything fresh out first. Will hit town tomorrow.
* [[2019.06.02 - Wiki Review: Crawl]]
** I will remind you that people with children tend to be significantly unhappier than those without.
* [[2019.06.02 - Prompted Introspection: Mother and Grandmother]]
** She does care more than her own. That I always grant her.
* [[2019.06.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Bit of a Joke]]
** I slowly climb this absurd amount. Everyone should do it.
* [[2019.06.02 - Family Log: Unpredictocles]]
** I've walked them through our financial accounts before, but I need to do it again. We'll have to find a game about managing finances which isn't shitty. I am grateful that many of their digital games are clearly about resource management.

** He spoke for 41 minutes with me even though he said it only be 20 to Rebecca. Time flies in our conversations.
