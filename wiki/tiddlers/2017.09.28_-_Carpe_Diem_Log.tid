* Woke up before the alarm. Good sleep.
* Worked hard.
* Played Magic with Robert at work.
* Listened to //Redemption in Indigo//
** It is getting very good.
* Fireman Time!
** VR porn is amazing.
* AndTidWiki isn't great, but it works. Yay. I can now edit directly.
** Resilio sync took some work since AndTidWiki doesn't let you choose another directory? Wtf is that?<<ref "2018.12.12">>
* I got my Bluetooth keyboard up and running. It is tremendous.
