title: 2019.03.05 - Wiki Review: 360. Get Some Sleep.

* [[2019.03.04 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Strawman]]
** Got damn! That's a helluva a sentence. Not easy to see how those parts fit together. 'Twas 360-noscope soup-to-nuts attempt.

** Coincidence that I was asked about it too. Neat.
* [[2019.03.04 - Wiki Review: Social]]
** [[K]] and [[AA]] are the most consistent. I do get along with hermits.

** Failure. `/smh`

* [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Focus]]
** I will happily pay the price.
* [[Antipleonasm Analysis: Focus]]
** Oh, shit. Well, I guess I'm going to have this in here too.
* [[Firmcoding Macros]]
** It grows!!
* [[h0p3punk]]
** Still mulling it around. It's interesting to see myself on a map.
