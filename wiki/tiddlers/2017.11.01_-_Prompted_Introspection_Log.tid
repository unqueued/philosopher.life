!! What if you support socialism, but act rationally-selfishly in the political-economy we have?

It is true that I do not have the power to change the world much at all. Sometimes support is all I can and should give from a stoic point of view. Having the right ideas, attempting to communicate them, and implementing them where I do have power is literally all I can do for a such a movement. It is also clear that we will fail, but that doesn't immediately give me the right to stop. I do not ask for certainty here, it could just be confidence. How confident must I be? I don't know. 

There does seem to be a bifurcation, although perhaps that is all you can do from a metamodern mode. It seems to lack integrity, but perhaps our lives are simply marred in this respect. We have to admit to ourselves that we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. We don't have the moral luck we need.

It reminds me of when a multi-national will not pay their fair share and then blame the laws. They had the ability to play fairly if they wanted. Is that what you mean? I think we are in rationalization territory here. If we are going to do that, then why not go balls to the wall? Go for broke. Sin boldly.
