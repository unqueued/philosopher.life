*** Guis, guis: you have all the choices available to you to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps. It's your fault that you aren't thriving! Millennials today, they are the fucking worst. You deserve to suffer. Yall need to be more like the wealthy clients who eventually recognize they don't want to be good people; they've instead embraced stoically ~~confabulating~~ reframing what is up to them so they don't have to give a shit about anyone else. Stop being poor and being accountable to anyone who you can't immediately benefit from, and you'll no longer feel any anxiety about how to live morally in our world today too. This is SO EZ, Jesus; I don't get how you can be this fucking retarded people. Thank god for the survival of the fittest; justice will be served to you lazy, weak pieces of shit who have everything and choose to do nothing with it.
