title: Fitness Routine

!! About:

// Live long and prosper. Fight depression, look hawt, release pleasure chemicals, and be healthier. Don't be a fucking idiot (like me); be sure to make fitness a habit. For the love of all that is holy, remember your body is a tool for your mind and not the other way around.//

I continue to fail myself and my children here. I'm beyond lazy and out of shape, and I only want to pick the lowest hanging fruit. Assuming I have the gumption: call and response training until the routine silently flows into a mindless march. Preferably, we do it outside too. This needs to be a daily routine. I've tried it before and failed, and that's okay. We have to try again. We'll construct this routine with a solid beginning and keep tweaking.

!! Principles:

* Grow a routine. Make it easy to modify, do some science in practice and theory. 
* Teach your children to give a shit about their bodies, and that includes via role-modeling to some non-trivial [[dok]].
* Make it price efficient, and the process of building it price efficient.
** Give yourself the fewest reasons not to do it.
* Construct in stages.
* Give explanations and howtos.

!! Focus:

!!!! __Stretch, Flex, Flow, and Balance__:

Push yourself without overextending, find the quantities and degrees which fit you, reverse what can be reversed (e.g. circles go clockwise + counterclockwise), breath deeply from your diaphragm as you stretch, and when in doubt, go slowly or skip it. The goal is to slide from one to another back-to-back for the economy of motion and time.

; Neck stretch
: Look left and right, look up and down, and tilt your head from shoulder to shoulder.
; Circular shoulder shrugs
: Roll your shoulders in unison.
; Arm circles
: Draw giant circles with your hands in unison.
; Elbow circles
: Point your elbows out to the side, point your fingers toward each other, and move your forearms in a circle like a chinook helicopter in unison.
; Finger extension
: Open your hands as much as possible, then make a fist in unison.
; Wrist circles
: Make fists and draw circles with your pointer finger knuckles in unison.
; Wrist extension
: Put your palms out, raise and lower one palm with the other. 
; Side bends
: Put your hands behind the back of your head, bend your body side to side to point your elbows vertically.
; Back and forward bends
: Put your hands on your hips, bend forward and backward while rounding your spine into an arch.
; Pelvic tilts
: Put your hands on your hips, and thrust your lower money makers to arch and hollow your back (probably the most important of all the exercises).
; Hip circles
: Put your hands on your hips, and grind your hips in circles to attract mates with your booty dance.
; Torso twists
: Helicopter your arms to grab your buttcheeks and pull.
; Toe touches
: Keep your legs straight while you bend down to reach for your toes.
; Lunging calf stretch
: Put one leg in front and the back leg straight, lean forward and push against your back calf.
; Standing groin stretch
: Spread your legs, put your hands on your thighs, lean to one side while bending that knee, keep the other leg straight, and push to get low.
; Squatting groin stretch
: Spread your legs, put your hands above your knees, keep your knees verticle to your feet, and squat like you are going to take a shit.
; High knee raises
: Stand on one leg, keep your body straight, and raise the other knee up high.
; Ankle circles
: Point your toes and draw a circle with the big toe.
; Toe extension
: Lift and spread your toes, then curl them into a foot fist in unison.


!!!! __Minimal Strength Circuit__:

Perform each set until you are 1-2 reps short of failure. Push yourselves, god damnit! Take deep breaths and rest for at least a minute between sets. 2-6 circuits are preferred, but one is better than zero. Progressively growing the difficulty through rep count, speed, and limb placement is part of how you measure improvement.

; Pushups
: Hands on the ground, put your feet together, keep your arms verticle and your body straight from head to toe, go down until your chest almost touches the ground while keeping elbows in and without shrugging shoulders, and push up. End in Child's Pose.
; Lunges
: Hands on hips, step one leg forward with heel down, lower torso until back knee touches the ground with front shin leg remaining verticle.
; Plank Shoulder Taps
: Hands on the ground verticle to your shoulders, face down, keep your body straight from head to toe, feel free to spread your legs for balance, one hand after the other touches their opposing shoulders. End in Child's Pose.
; Pullups, Chinups, and Rows
: Find something which can safely support your weight (use our bar), pull yourself up palms out and let yourself down for pullups, then palms in for chinups, then plant your feet so that you angle yourself to the floor with a straight body and with palms down on a lowered bar (palms out) for rows.


!!!! __Minimal Cardio Exercise__:

Getting your heart rate up is obviously preferred, and I'm a hypocrite. Running works (my knees can't, but yours can). For now, we'll walk or swim for at least half an hour.

!! Vault:

; Leg rotations
: Stand on one foot, and rotate your body to point your other foot to the left or right.
; Buttkicks
: Kick your butt while keeping your foot's motion in a vertical line.
