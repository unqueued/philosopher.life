title: 2019.05.01 - Charlie: Feeling Better

Charlie is feeling better! Yay!

He got a new guitar, and we talked about the differences between his new and old one. We talked about West Virginia Mountain music style considerations.

We talked about Ithkuil, Klingon, Esperanto, and Hebrew especially (his specialty). He concern for precision in Biblical translation at the expense of the studies and theology on top of it can be annoying to me at times, but I'm sure I am the exact same way with most people, lol.
