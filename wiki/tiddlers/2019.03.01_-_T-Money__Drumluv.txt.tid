To build a vocabulary so that I can say things concisely and with self-citation to the wiki.

I'm definitely intrigued. I personally have never thought of love more than the surface. Is the confusing emotion that is app to change with anyone singular event potentially

I've always identified love as being a very fickle emotion. But over the years I have learned the true love. To use an overused phrase. Is definitely not fickle. As I would describe the love that I have for my mother oh, my wife, or my daughter. I do not believe there was anything they could do or any potential event that we keep me from loving them.

I'm still learning about it.

I suppose it will feel that void very short time. There is no true satisfaction in material things. But I have money so I buy them even for a momentary relief I'm self-loathing and frustration
