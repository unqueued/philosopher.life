*** That's exactly how you know this is completely full of shit. It's hollow, just like its metaethics. It's an arm of capitalism-apology and reactionazism. Elitists philanthropy is disguise.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://reallifemag.com/faked-out/
*** There's hope in that piece.

*** This hydra is growing larger than I could have possibly imagined.

* Think About It
** https://epochemagazine.org/merleau-ponty-education-and-the-meno-paradox-4ddd0702529e
*** I don't get what the huge deal is. I think Merleau-Ponty is talking about the relationship between top-down and bottom-up-reasoning (empiricism) and the necessary rationalist hardware (and then software) supporting those structures. I must be losing my touch.
** https://medium.com/@sumdepony/americans-are-generally-conflict-theorists-9649dd153e1c
*** Conflict theorists recognize dialectical reality in some cases.
** http://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/we-are-all-bewildered-machines
*** I think you're boned without metaphysics. I decry those who act like they don't have any and slip in the backdoor.
** https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/16/chinas-orwellian-social-credit-score-isnt-real/
*** I think the point is that it is in development.

* Fishy
** https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/11/15/across-the-west-powerful-firms-are-becoming-even-more-powerful
*** I think this is a dogwhistle and reminder to the elite. I don't think this has anything to do with solving a problem other than protecting those in power.

** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/opinion/sunday/fascism-economy-monopoly.html
*** And, yet, you do not point out the contradiction built into capitalism that must give rise to this. You either purposely work towards decentralization as far as you can to combat the beast or you lose. (call me on my false dichotomy; let's go down the rabbithole)
** https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/12/letter-to-an-aspiring-doctor
*** You need to look again at the power structures.
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/26/how-extreme-weather-is-shrinking-the-planet
*** Yet, that is not an argument for decentralizing power.
