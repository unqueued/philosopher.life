//Mad Men// quotes are elegant. There's no question about [[The Moral Law]] or motivation here other than //you don't desire it//. Don't question anything beyond what you desire. Obey your thirst. If you want something, just take it. Manipulate those around you however you need to change their beliefs and desires to suit your assumed needs. Conversation is an art, and you can perform great evil in how you steer, shape, and engage in it. We have moral duties to each other in our language games. The above quote assumes the pursuit of power at any cost.<<ref "a">>
