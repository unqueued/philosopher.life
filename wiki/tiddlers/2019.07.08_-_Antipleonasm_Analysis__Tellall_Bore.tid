title: 2019.07.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tellall Bore

!! Respond to the following gem:

The secret of being a bore is to tell everything.

That's exactly what I do. I'm an extremely boring person. What does [[h0p3]] do? He walks, talks, watches, reads, and writes. I blather about inane things, useless details, the stupid bullshit of my life, TMI into oblivion, and speak of nothing but everything. I am like the entomologist who pins bugs and butterflies on his prolix wiki; I make codificationism as boring as one might think it is. Slicing through the marble slab for the [[salience]] isn't what I do for you. I leave no mystery if I can help it. What you see is what you get. I'm super boring for being so insane, and that's because I tell everything. But, so what? Boring to whom? When does an audience's attention, approval, or interest have merit?
