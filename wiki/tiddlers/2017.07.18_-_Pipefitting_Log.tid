title: 2017.07.18 - Pipefitting Log

//I dedicate this page to clay mud. It was a messy day.//

I sat in the car reading offline web content and writing while waiting for people to show up this morning. They didn't show up until about 7:40 today. Both Jaye and Terry (and his boys) arrived at the same time. I've had to move my car out of the way for people twice. I take it that I need to be better at selecting spots. 

Before we began, Terry came over and looked at our pipe. He noticed we 1-holed instead of 2-hole. Fuck! I can't believe I forgot that; it's my first time ever working with this many holes (huge flanges!). I had to cut, grind, rebevel, and straighten it. Jaye was pissed but remained cordial. It was my fault. I borrowed Terry's two-holes to do this job. Jaye is clearly annoyed that I don't have all the tools of the trade. Also, we left the pipe open overnight. That is a no-no. I knew better, but I forgot. 

It sucks that I suck at this. But, I will get better. This is how you get better, h0p3. Just keep going, and do your best. This is an opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. You are getting paid to go to school, to pick up that ever so valuable experience. I'll get the knack of/for it over time. I'm a damned good learner, and it's just time and pressure that will get me there. Think of how far you've come in 6 months. Nobody does this, and you can't expect the impossible of yourself. You are only human. 

I started grinding the underground pipe to make it level. The gap is just too fucking large for Jaye (although, Terry is convinced Jaye should be able to do any gap without a bevel). The spirit level helped tremendously. I was afraid of dropping my torpedo down the pipe (don't think we could fish it out). My only worry at this point is that the measurements I took off the concrete will now be off. It might make the pipe less-than-level, which is what I'm desperately trying to avoid.

Before lunch, we were able to fit it and drop a root on the 90. We also attached the butterfly valve and extension (I don't know what to call it, it's a nipple with a flange on each end). I desperately want the fucking 6" quikfit clamp for this, as it would allow me to stop trying to hold it in place (a real pain in the ass, it kept slipping the whole time, and we were almost at the ground, so no jackstands were possible) and focus on getting it square against the pipe. I found out the chiller's pipe we are connecting to isn't perfectly square with the rest of the chiller's structure either. Basically, I'm going to have to finesse and force this one. Flanges would be the only real way out of it, but it doesn't look like Terry wants to let us do that (although, he does it for himself).

Terry is working on the same project on Chiller#2 (might not be #2 on the drawing...no an iso). I asked Terry what he wanted me to work on next. He has some strainers to put on the extended nipple, I believe, but doesn't know after that. He said he is trying to find out from Barry what needs to happen. 

Terry used the forklift+crane vehicle (don't know the name) to lug a very large "strainer" (might be a valve) to us to fit up. We had to rig it, and I'm glad we had his help. It would have been back-breaking to do by hand and would have taken 3-4 guys.

I found out after lunch that Terry is actually building some pieces for me. He told me several times that I deserved to be cussed out, and that others would. He said I'm lucky I'm working with him because he's not like that. He continually needs to put me in my place, as if I don't already know it. It rubs him the wrong way that I make what I do (which is only $18), and he said it will piss off others too since I make as much as a guy who has been fitting with this company for 3-4 years, he says. He says workers gossip like women, and it will be everywhere. 

Apparently, Jaye makes more than the average welder at this company as a temp, which shocked him. What makes people loyal to this company then? Why do they love it? Is it just the lesser of the evils?

Our welding machine is going wonky. I was blamed for it because I was grinding while Jaye was welding. Terry was not kind about it. How should I have known? Jaye was fine with it. Only after Terry made a big deal did Jaye start acting like it was stupid too. Jaye is obviously playing a game, and he lacks integrity.  I hate to say it, but I'm losing respect for him as well. 

Terry continued to point out that I'm not producing enough. He complains that I do too much in-position welding, but we only did one...which was absolutely required, as he pointed out. He complains I bevel since his son doesn't get a bevel. But, my welder requires it of me; and if my welder requires it, then I have to do it (as he admits). He blames me for the lack of productivity for this beveling though. He's right that I'm not thinking ahead as well as he is, that I'm not as good at this job as he is (by miles), but I don't think I can be expected to perform at his level (nor do I get paid nearly as much as he does). He did agree I'm doing my best, but he expects more than my best. 

He said it was ridiculous that I didn't know that butterfly valves didn't need gaskets because they already had them built in, that I had never heard of a cap bolt, and the other ignorant mistakes I've made. Does anyone know this stuff after 6 months? I have a hard time believing it. I'm doing my dead level best, seriously. 

Also, I recall seeing him on the phone after the butterfly question I asked him today. There is a reasonable chance he is complaining about me to Barry. This could be the beginning of the end of the job. 

He told me, correcting his son's version of the story, about getting his first truck as a pipefitter after 8 years (not 5). When he came home, his daddy told him, you ain't even a good pipefitting helper yet, you don't deserve a truck. This is the mentality he has, kinda of. It's more relaxed than his dad's, but he thinks it is absurd that I'm here at all. Perhaps he is right. He went on to say that calling myself a pipefitter after only 6 months is an oxymoron. I didn't argue. Obviously, I don't consider myself even a decent pipefitter (although, I consider myself amazing for 6 months). Do I get paid to pipefit? Yes. Then I'm a pipefitter, right? Am I doing the work of journeyman? Well, I'm trying. I didn't say I was a journeyman pipefitter, a god, etc. You give me 5 years, and I will run circles around your ass though.

I thanked him for his patience, for telling me what he thinks, and for teaching me. I told him I'm here to learn and gain experience. He said that's why they sent me to him because others wouldn't put up with me. He said to learn as much I could while I still can. Mind you, I've been beyond respectful. Why would they blame me for their low wages? Why is it my fault that I don't have the skill and experience he is looking for? Are you fools? Those in power are the problem, not me. 

He made sure to speak with Jaye, again, about riding me harder. He thinks that Jaye is going to easy on me. He readily has charitable attitudes towards Jaye, who does no wrong. I'm the real enemy, lol.

Terry figured out what he wanted me to do. He had a flange on a long piece of pipe, and a flanged nipple attached to it as well. He helped me make the measurement (which was difficult, and I'm glad I had his help...it was very non-obvious how to do it) off the chiller to the underground pipe we were running off of. We cut the nipple to that length and fitted the 90 to it. I'm not used to 2-holing off bolts, and the fitting is just different than how I've done it in the shop. He said he wanted one more, and showed me a nipple already ready to be cut. That's what he wanted to be done by the end of the day.

Jaye had to leave early, so we rushed to finish everything. It was level though. 

Obviously, I have tons to learn. I'm just really frustrated by the flack that I'm getting. Even if I get fired, I'll have made enough this week to get us above $2k in the bank, to buy the kids new mattresses, and will have acquired some actual experience. I will do what I can. This is a really hard week, again. 

I have to admit, I'm really hating this job. This is not what I signed up for. The hard work, yes. The blood, sweat, burns, and soreness, yes. The learning, the constructing, and the figuring things out, yes. Getting bitched at and blamed? No. I don't have the heart for it. It is not my fault that people are stupid and psychopathic. I'm going to put up with it for now because I should, and it is reasonable enough. I may get fired, and that's okay. I'll just be leaving if they do cuss me out though. That's not the life I'm going to live. I have too much self-worth to be treated like that.
