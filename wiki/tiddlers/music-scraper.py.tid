#Before running this script, make sure you install BeautifulSoup!
#You only need to run "sudo pip install beautifulsoup4", and that has all the extra tools for the script.
#You should also place this script in its own directory - all the files download to the current directory, and you don't wan't a huge mess.
#It already cleans up, so the only files in the directory after it's fully run should be the script itself and your music files.
