When I am working on [[Outopos]] I feel like a lost builder trying to build a train station model toy, a person who creates little worlds of trust, empathy, and utopia.

Am I addicted or merely highly dependent on the concept of [[Trust]]. I obviously have trust issues.

Here is what I have to say to my donors:

Not only do you not follow what I consider the basic tenants of the [[Categorical Imperative]], the golden rule, you do not abide by your own stated principles (the mutated memeplex dialect of Christianity you delusionally feel you have the authority to call "Orthodox" which just so happens to conveniently include an egoistically (and perhaps thus psychopathically) corrupted version of the golden rule). It is obvious that you are wrong, and you refuse to look at it despite claiming you are looking at it. You are Hypocrites at fundamental levels. I cannot abide by it. 

This wiki is a proof of my integrity. What do you have? You have what sits in our memories and an objective state of affairs we can never know; and, unfortunately, we have very different memories. What are we besides a unique Daseinic emergence from the right computational hardware system of [beliefs, inferences, and desires] with the right software system of [beliefs, inferences, and desires] generated inside a meatsack? We are each reducible to that. I know why you are the way you are, but that doesn't mean I have to forgive you. You have failed enough tit-for-tats for a lifetime. I have empathized with you beyond what you could possibly imagine; it was not easy for an autist. Enough is enough. This is it. We're done.
