My brother had a shit day at work. His shoulders are feeling it, it was monotonous, and it wasn't the best way to do it (but it wasn't up to him). It sounded like a lot of tiny things went wrong and added up into an attrition war. Despite that: he is in good spirits. He's "high" on his anti-depressants and understandably so! That is amazing. I can see the difference on him, and so, ofc, he can see it in and on him. I wish it 10-fold for him. I can feel his pep and (he may not like my phrase here) will! I hope he continues to snowball.

We talked about my job. It was fine.

He went to see [[AIR]]. He wrote a note and decided to knock on the door (there was no car? I take it my brother doesn't have one now? I'm scared to ask). [[AIR]] was hostile, and he doesn't want to talk with anyone. [[JRE]] told me about a time when he asked [[AIR]] to  hangout, and [[AIR]] said he didn't have time to deal with [[JRE]]'s problems (which not only missed the point but was ridiculously dark-triadic). I can see everyone is in pain. I told my brother, [[JRE]], that he was being absurdly charitable. His SO, Rebecca, was correct in her judgment. We are all lucky to have [[JRE]] in our lives.

We talked about the letter to [[kickscondor]]. He had strong reactions to what I said (I did too). We didn't talk about [[Sphygmus]]'  temp-private words yet, but they are also wrecking me today. It has been emotional.
