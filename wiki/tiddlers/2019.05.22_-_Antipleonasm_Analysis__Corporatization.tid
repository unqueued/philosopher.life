title: 2019.05.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Corporatization

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The "corporatization of America" during the past century has been an attack on democracyâ€”and on markets, part of the shift from something resembling "capitalism" to the highly administered markets of the modern state/corporate era. A current variant is called "minimizing the state," that is, transferring decision-making power from the public arena to somewhere else: "to the people" in the rhetoric of power; to private tyrannies, in the real world.

The conclusion is obviously correct. Public power is being privatized into the hands of the few, corporations and those who own them especially. This is part of the centralization of political power. Explicit aims to minimize the state can be traced back to at least Locke (though the seeds are ancient). The Rand-Locke memeplex is evolving and playing out here. What do you expect from hyperindividualism which doesn't respect the collective, the Kingdom of Ends, and [[The Others]]? Legislating egoism enables those in power to snowball their power and disproportionately impose their wills on everyone. This is an attack on democracy! Slavery comes in [[dok]], and that's exactly what is produced in Libertarianism. It's written into the very principles of their conception of historical justice.

My prediction continues to be an unrecoverable catastrophe. Unlike Marx, I think the window for the possibility of a successful revolution is closing. He could not have predicted the mousetraps we can build with modern technology (and I won't hold him responsible for that either); his theory remains remarkably [[salient]] even in virtue of advances in the self-described information age.
