title: The List

//I'm taking [[Philosophy]] requests from [[others]]. This Running [[TDL]] is a [[costly|Wiki Litmus Test]] list. We justifiably prompt me to radically define, explain, justify, fix, or apologize for it. This should be a [[Leet]] conveyor belt built into {[[Focus]]}. With [[Process Discipline]] (and obviously not just  cognitive discipline), wrestle control of {[[Focus]]}, especially [[Recent Obsessions]], wisely.//
