title: 2019.09.12 - Prompted Introspection: Marked Characteristic

!! What is your most marked characteristic?

From what perspective, in what context, [[gfwiwcgws]]? The question is missing crucial chunks of information here. I think //marked// might carry some baggage here too, but maybe I'm just seeing things. One of my most marked characteristics is how I can be ironic or thorough in attempting to answer questions of all kinds, including some which I find unsatisfactory, wrong-headed, or annoying. Even if nothing is directly answered, I [[hope]] something valuable emerges, even if only practice in critical reasoning for other circumstances. I aim to be justifiably useful to [[others]], including my [[4DID]], particularly in how I engage in dialectics. One day, I [[hope]] I'll be a worthy man.
