<<<
I don't understand. It worked for all these years. How could it just stop working?
<<<

<<<
I wonder if clouds ever look down on us and say "Hey look, that one is shaped like an idiot."
<<<

<<<
They make a dollar to my dime, so I shit on their time.
<<<

<<<
It works better than you do.
<<<

<<<
There it ain’t.
<<<

<<<
It fell on the floor, it can't fall any farther.
<<<

<<<
Nothing new after 2; no more after four.
<<<

<<<
I'm tired; can you call yourself an idiot?
<<<

<<<
Getting paid to do the work twice is nice, but three times is better.
<<<

<<<
At the end of a shift, walking out with the foreman or other supervision within earshot: "fucked 'em out of another 8."
<<<

<<<
On a large job: "hide'n'seek for a grand a week"
<<<

<<<
I haven't seen one this tight since I was a teenager.
<<<

<<<
It's good enough for this place.
<<<

<<<
I gotta vision problem...can’t see myself coming in today boss.
<<<

<<<
I may not be fast, but when I'm done it'll sure look like I was in a hurry.
<<<

<<<
We're not in this for the money, we're in this to make dreams come true!
<<<

<<<
If money is no object, we'll get this right if it takes every penny you have.
<<<

<<<
We don't have the time to explain common sense.
<<<

<<<
Half of this job is knowing what you're doing. The other half is knowing how to cover up what you're doing.
<<<

<<<
I'm never wrong. I thought I was once, but I was mistaken.
<<<

<<<
It was working fine before you got here.
<<<

<<<
I thought you were going to take care of that...
<<<

<<<
These parts won't install themselves, son.
<<<

<<<
All we have to do is finish up.
<<<

<<<
Some people are like slinkies. They serve absolutely no useful purpose, but still put a smile on your face when pushed down a flight of stairs.
<<<

<<<
You're strong like a bull and twice as smart.
<<<

<<<
They don't call us good for nothing. 
<<<

<<<
I can't concentrate when I'm thinking.
<<<

<<<
My life is a series of awkward and humiliating moments separated by snacks.
