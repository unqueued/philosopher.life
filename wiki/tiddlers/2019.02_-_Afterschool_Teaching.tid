!! Audit:

* This feels like the first solid month of work. The paycheck doesn't look much different (yay for making $300 every two weeks), but...meh, whatever. It helps, and I'm helping others.
** Ain't nobody going to pay you to be yourself, [[h0p3]]. To whatever minimal [[dok]] to which they care to even understand you, most people fucking hate you and what you are doing. Give it away like an economically poor, memetically wealthy philanthropist. 
* Just from the top-down look, I suggest they are prepping for me to take Matt's place.
** I don't give a shit about status. I get paid slave wages, and this is charity. I'm just exploitable human capital to the admin and nothing more. 
** I still don't understand my role. That's bad, right? I suppose that means I get to carve it out. Yet, I still don't understand it then either. 
*** Fool!
* Delp has been sick a lot.
* It's chaotic here. There's not a lot that I can rely upon to be static.
* I'm failing to get kids to actually try an elective. How can I convince them that their time is valuable? How can I convince them they are valuable? How can I be of use to them? They don't even realize I could be of use to them. (You don't know that you don't know what you don't know all too often.)
* I'm pretty heartbroken by how nobody wants to read. The teachers and students are proud of it.
** Naw, I'm shit at it too.
* Daniel, not David. Lol. Jesus Christ.
* I'm so disappointed in the humans around me. I'm trying not to be hopeless. 
** I don't get why we have to control their sexuality. Who gives a shit? They don't fucking READ! WAKE UP!!
** I've been here so many times. I'm a drop in the bucket; without collective effort, we fail. I will hold up my end of the bargain, but I cannot blame myself for that which is not within my power.
* People are getting to know me.
* I've stopped taking the 5th graders because Whitney doesn't feel old enough to manage the older kids, thus she takes the younger crowd.
* I know people are evil, and yet, I am still somehow shocked by the amount of dishonesty I see. Again, and again, I find deception everywhere. It's so normalized that the experience is hypernormalized.
* I am a subversive prisonguard.
