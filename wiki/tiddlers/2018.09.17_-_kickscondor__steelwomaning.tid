Hi h0p3-

So I am going to try to rewind and do as you say: to take a better shot at addressing your part of our 'hyperconversation'. I am sending you this as a private letter so that you can censor it if you like. I feel like I am starting to border on a troll of some type ;) and feel like the nature of my blog would turn this into a type of 'broadcast' that can still receive 'thumbs up' and such sordid things.

I hope I can preface these remarks - even if it seems like a bad idea, because it can perceived as changing the topic, taking time away from the 'meat'. I will get to the topic(s) - but I wonder if some other items might be more pressing (might even be the 'meat') because it seems they might be preventing the main discussion from occurring fruitfully.

ON BEING 'INTELLECTUAL'
Ok, so stepping back - I've jumped headlong into a discussion with you. (And might I just add: this is a rare opportunity for me and I feel fortunate to have the chance to converse - for you to respect my communications enough that you will give them the thought you have. I have NEVER had the opportunity to correspond in a strictly written way with anyone ever before - to attempt to come to an understanding with them - hmm, well, maybe once, but not to this extent - and this whole time I am wondering if the medium has its limits. I guess this is where Socrates chimes in. Well, of course it does - but I am probably the largest of those limitations - and that feels good. Perhaps my ability to write will strain under the pressure, perhaps yours - and it requires even more of our abilities to read and internalize each other's writings! For this reason, I would like the conversation to remain written and for us to find some kind of resolution this way.)

This correspondence has had about three major episodes from each of us. I saw this encounter as a foray into a 'pen pal' type thing - which is to say: 'informal', 'inconsequential' and 'probably frivolous'. (I hope you will let me say all three of those things in _good_ ways, very good ways. I also admire that you are reaching out through/with your autism to speak with me - I do worry about aggravating your own pain, of putting you under unreasonable expectations of my own and of not seeing the full picture of 'you' - who you are past 'h0p3'. But only if you need it - I would rather just see 'h0p3' for now - this creation is by design and I intend to take it in.) I don't feel that I want to 'wrestle' - I want to 'pen pal'. After all, this is a work of fiction. The contents of this letter are products of the reader's imagination. This letter is for entertainment purposes only. Although the form of this letter is autobiographical, it is not. Although this letter may appear authentic, it is not. What appears to be 'wrestling' may actually be a new type of sophisticated 'pal' engagement maneuver.

Now, I am not an intellectual by any stretch - I have idea no who Kierkegaard is and I can't keep Kant and Hume straight. I do read a lot - fiction by a wide margin. I do read Vygotsky and Piaget and, sometimes, Jung. Of all the philosophers, I am most fond of Socrates - and feel a brotherhood with you through him. But the writers that I spend my time on are fiction writers - Albert 'Vigoleis' Thelen is someone I speak to in my mind very often. To call out to him: 'Vigoleis' when I see his place in the world. Denton Welch and Robert Walser are like this for me. But even these closest - I cannot speak intellectually about them, only romantically.

So yes - I think you want to have a philosophical debate with me, but I am not equipped to do it. And I wonder if it is possible at all. I can't read all those guys and read your wiki and read the things I want to read and pursue my current ambitions. I don't think you want to have this discussion unless I am an equipped intellectual. We are both trying to sing and shatter a glass - but your voice is trained. So while I might still be the one to shatter the glass here and there, it's a hell of a lot more painful having to hear my notes along the way. So this is my opening question: am I misrepresenting what this discussion is - and what do you want out of it? (In a way, I feel I can almost 'steel' this because of the statement: "There is a lack of fairness in the dialectic here; I've had way more practice thinking about the nitty-gritty, and I must be extremely cautious not to assume others can or will see what I do." - I agree with this and I feel like I am only fleshing it out further above. And this: "I can't see far enough to know if he can see what I'm saying (which is a fairly technical claim in moral philosophy)." - I don't see it, I had no idea there was some central claim to 'hyperconversations' - I thought it was a series of different claims with some riddles mixed in - which is, I think, where the central claim is nestled? "I am failing this man." - Dude, I don't rely on you - I have my own system of living - I'm not just an imbalanced pinball lost in your machine! :D)

And this: "Hedonic Kierkegaardian Aestheticism is here; it's inaccurately factored into the eudaimonic calculation." I'm not going to even try to parse this - if I tried, my reaction would be: I don't feel like my aestheticism is hedonic at all, but quite virtuous! So I think your phrase is going to be misunderstood by me and I am just going to sound ridiculous. :D Perhaps this comment is not meant for me but for the audience, k0sh3k included. (Hey kid! If you exist! Hey! I /will/ you to exist for a single 'Hey there!')

> Some classic Romanticism in here. Reminds me of that fighting phrase: "Brawl a boxer, box a brawler." I've seen this shift many times against my arguments.

I do think we are paired as boxer vs brawler. That was what I trying to say when listing out some of our opposing polarities - you are codifying me in your statement above as well - no harm, just part of trying to understand someone. I don't feel that you are degenerate and I don't think you (yet) believe that I am either. I don't sense that you are trying to assimilate everyone as boxers. But I do think that not being a boxer would forfeit my scrappy end of the 'wrestle' or 'debate' side and leave us to the 'pen pal' aspect strictly.

This is not a small aspect: while I have not been charitable with argumentation, I believe that I have been charitable with the effect you've had on my own work and charitable with the credit I give you for stirring up my inventive mind and stimulating me to materialize it. This will last beyond an argument.

For my part: I am not as interested in some of the topics we're touching on: stuff like emotion/reason (I have spent almost no time thinking about my arguments there, I am going off half-cocked and I do appreciate/embrace your sayings), what 'the good' is (I am trying to figure out what the thrust of our discussion even is, man I can't even begin to sort that out) and even T42T - I still think they are all very worthy topics, but I don't think I'm your foil on those. I agree with you that I should be required to defend my ethics - but I also don't have a list on hand like you do - and it's changing too much for me to even know how to nail it down. I like the part which explores the texture of our online avatars, but even there - I think I need to sit in the presence of them longer before trying to mouth off about them.

ON 'SADNESS'
I am going to try to make this quick and to the point - which isn't "you can't make me sad" but that "momentary sadness doesn't register as much when there are more permanent sorrow in place" something like that.

But what's so bad about this sorrow anyway? A woman crossed the street yesterday, waving to me, so I stood and waited for her. She said she knew someone - a name I recognized. She was pleasant and warm to talk to, so we talked. She said that her son had been murdered many years ago. If you just listened to her for five minutes, you would have thought she was insane. Very pleasant and insane. In a good way, a very good way. A whirlwind of details about trajectories and cover-ups. But if you listened for an hour, you could finally she her - and her sorrow. It wasn't disgusting or repulsive - but familiar and natural. Just a sorrow - as plain as a pleasantness.

I wanted to show her something in the yard, so I motioned for her to cross the gutter - which is quite wide and was rushing with water - it's more of a canal than a gutter. But her legs were short and she said, "Oh I don't know." I held out my hand and she made a move to try to cross. I realized that she was wearing flip-flops and trying to avoid some spiky weeds. I held out both hands - I probably shouldn't have tried to persuade her - I don't know, I began to pull her across and she kind of panicked and made a squeal! She stumbled over - she made it - and we laughed out of relief and I felt stubborn, but it was good to move abruptly from sorrow to laughter like that. Like we had come up for air. We are still in the ocean but we are in the air too.

And I wouldn't like it if you held back some criticism. I should love to be rebuked! When you are in the freezing ocean, it is probably the best time to hear that you have made a grammatical mistake. What a helpful distraction that could be! And you may never forget to make it again.

And children, when they are rebuked - so often they simply drop their head down and say slowly, 'Ohhh kay...' For me, this embodies such an ideal - first, to acknowledge that criticism DOES sting, direct criticism truly can, possibly always does, it makes us drop our heads to hear - and, secondly, to simply 'ack' the criticism with no further commentary or defense. Perhaps to go without defense would be too submissive - on the other hand, can we endure any criticism as adults? Any?

I probably am doing my own sidestepping and defensiveness of criticism in this letter. I do know I am better to just drop my head and say slowly, 'Ohhh kay...'

> All of this context to say: I realize you aren't making fun of me at all here, and I appreciate that very much.

Yes, but if we can find a way to truly make fun of each other - wouldn't that be such a grand achievement?

ON 'HYPERCONVERSATIONS'

> The shadow over our eyes is a serious problem: I believe it costs us the ability to be cognitively and emotionally vulnerable (even to ourselves). We don't really get to know each other when we are engaged in good opsec (that's kind of the point). The public/private adversarial tension does seem contradictory, but I hope to find a middle way; surely there is a linear logical framework from which geometric social cooperation can arise (I must hope).

Continued here:

> You can always doubt, and you can only ever improve your Bayesian odds. The inductive step in trust is a leap of faith in Humanity, in The Other, sir. Building trust and real relationships is exactly why I reveal myself to you and everyone else. I want people to see how I conduct myself and my relationships across the board.

And then:

> With diamond balls, I really aim to be practically transparent in my practice of saying what I mean and meaning what I say directly because my integrity is at stake.

And also:

> We are each cameras, in a sense. I think of this wiki as an external, reifying camera of my internal camera states. I do hope to wield both wisely. I do not think I morally own either of them all the way down except insofar as I am constituted by (exist as an extension or instantiation of) The Moral Law. 

If I were to try to identify this central 'claim' you are making and to 'steel' it: You feel that true and real relationships demand radical transparency. More than that, you see it as a virtue - embodying bravery, integrity and honesty. You see it as a direct solution to prevailing mistrust and misunderstanding in the world. You model this behavior for others.

To you, h0p3, this has a blissful and fortuitous collaboration with modern surveillance. You aren't saying, "What do I have to hide?" It seems that you are saying, "You can't make me hide." And I do not think you do not see it as the 'correct' choice - you seem to acknowledge that it is a trade-off - but that you are willing to pay the price. But you believe you have sorted it out: you do believe that the reward will always be greater than the price.

Am I in the ballpark? I don't really know how to do this!

To this, I have no response. I can only hang my head and say slowly, "Ok Mister H..."

I felt no need to respond to that claim after the letter - I found it well-reasoned! I did wonder how much of it is grounded in the tech ideals of 'open source' and 'gratis'/'libre' - I've had other tech friends dabble in transparency (sharing bank account info publicly, cataloging life activity publicly.) I stand by what I said:

> The remarkable thing about your wiki is that you have turned your camera on. In fact, your wiki is defiantly personal - I think it goes beyond a mere camera. Your history. Your conversations. Your letter to your parents. Your thoughts about people - about me. A person can turn on a camera and never say these things. You are on to something. I have no desire to talk you out of it.

I realize now that saying nothing is a failure. You need an 'ack'. Even if it is a repetition.

I think there is something unanswered here, though: Do you have any adaptations to 'Gentle ClearNet Doxxing' after the events of the last month? I have wondered if you were going to write more about this - maybe I missed it. To stand by a rule too doggedly is to be - well - dogmatic. Or has the rule functioned properly? (On the other hand, I might also aspire to be dogmatic about FOSS - just for myself and not for anyone else.) Feel free to just link me to the correct answers that I cannot seem to locate.

Ok, that is the end of this letter. I ran across the "business card" page on your wiki while researching "transparency" and loved it.
