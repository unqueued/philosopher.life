We have been spending our Sunday's collectively reflecting and planning. They are family meetings. They are the beacons, markers, or instances of decision making. This is the clock cycle of the turing computer of our family's decision procedure.

I've been devoting my Sunday's to reflecting on the past week, on the coming week, on the past month, on the coming month, on the past year, on the coming year, and so on.

We figure out how to compatibilize ourselves. We figure out how to help each other attain their goals. We work together. We think together. We value together.
