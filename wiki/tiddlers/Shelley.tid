title: Shelley

Hey Shelley,

I know this letter is out-of-the-blue, which may be inappropriate because we might feel more like acquaintances than friends. If this letter is awkward, I apologize (my autism sometimes knows no bounds). My wife said you might not be feeling well, and I thought I'd reach out.

I've always known you were a different kind of person from the day I met you. You're interesting, and over the 13 years I've been married to my wife, you've come up in conversations many times.

If you are bored or interested in having another friend to talk with about anything, I'm available. I'd like to get to know you better. Finding good friends later in life can be harder because it's such a large investment in understanding each other. In case you wanted to get to know me better (and my weirdness), I keep a wiki here: https://philosopher.life/. 

Assuming you were interested in getting to know each other: if you prefer end-to-end encryption or anonymity, that can also be arranged (see: {[[Contact]]} on the [[Root]] page). 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
