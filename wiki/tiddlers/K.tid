* Brothers! Husband to my sister, [[L]]. 
* My daughter jokes that he begins conversations with a goodbye. She's right. Indeed, his standard greeting is: "Have a great day!" It's a fascinating move in the language game. I could functionally accomplish the same thing with a bot sending goodbye-greetings on rotation to folks in the morning. It's not a conversation starter, but more a signal to look like he's started a conversation. It also reminds me of passing people in the hall, and we exchange a [[smalltalk]] snippet of code to each other which don't explicitly end the conversation, but we aren't actually interested in speaking with each other. That's not what I think he means though. It's just an odd way of doing it.
