Do we have power over our power? The [[infinigress]] of autonomy. Eventually, it feels as though power often consumes someone, remakes them into an instrument of itself. Perhaps at first you own your power, but sometimes it comes to own you. The powerful do not challenge themselves, and the disempowered cannot challenge them. Speaking truth to power is often powerless. In even near perfect competition, the weak are slaughtered and enslaved by the mighty. Power to imprison, to silence, to censor, to interfere with due process, to misrepresent. Information advantages, knowledge is power (but often in very limited respects) too. The conversion of economic power to political power.
You can destroy and steal, or you can build for and serve others. Power to shelter oneself from criticism, accountability, to generate privacy, to generate anonymity, to get away with murder, to wield the treacherously [[ROG]] more literally. Dominating power is in some sense unconstrained. It is up to masters how they will or will not use their power. Such power is often described as arbitrary or discretionary; or, perhaps, unlimited by the interests of those under its sway. Power over [[other]] minds....merely influencing them, to getting them to do things, to getting them to want to those things, to getting them to want to want to do those things. Sure, it's power to destroy the planet, enslave people, but it's also power to build, cultivate, and thrive. Accountability, representational voting, and veto powers. Power is often about dominating others as means to exercising control over our environment. It is easily abused. Power doesn't have to be about exploitation though, no: it can be used to stop exploitation, to prevent it, to make it infeasible, to fight it, etc.


Power comes in spectrums, [[dok]], softness and hardness, various structural expressions and strategic positions in gamestates, formal and informal, positivistically legitimate or illegitimate, consensualities, microscopic to macroscopic, epheremal, episodic, justified and unjustified, implicit or explicit, secret or open, private or public, mainstream or countercultural, tactically rational or irrational, unilateral or bilateral, always capacity of control (but of or over what?), overt and covert, multi-ordered and dimensional, latent potential or actual, constructive or deconstructive. Butterfly causality. Circuitry. Outcomes of power. Power is causal. Potential, it is the possibility to influence outcomes. It forms, accumulates, transmits, acquired, and can be restructured.


Power can be intoxicating, corrupting, tempting, Machiavellian lust-inducing, attractive, rewarding, and redirecting. Power reveals who we are, what we're really made of, etc. It's where we get to apply our principles, shape the world according to who we are, etc. We are the motivation of our power. Those with power tend to lack or lose their empathy ([[YSB]]), lie fluently without mental or physiological stress, self-interestedly rationalize the stereotypification of those who don't have power, tend to deviate from social norms in self-interested manners, increases in fundamental misattribution errors, dark-triadic disregard for risks and ethics, spend less energy reasoning about subordinates, and devalue those who are less powerful. Power tends to make one more self-serving, uninhibited, first-movers willing to take action, negotiate. Empowered people are more optimistic, experience elevated levels of executive power in self-control, are hedonically happier, and smile more often. Autonomy does that.

Wisdom, Power, Selfishness Triangle: pick at most 2. Power without compassion is evil. Wisdom without power achieves nothing. Peace, too, can only ever be a result of power.

Power over still seems capable of admitting simple potential. What does it mean to exercise? Can one passively exercise power through implicit game structures? Seems like it. Power-to vs. Power-over

Power has to be acquired. Power may only be exercised. Power is a matter of authority.路Power belongs to an individual. Power belongs only to the collective. Power cannot be attributed to anyone, it is a quality of social systems.路Power involves conflict. Power does not involve conflict in every case. Power generally involves conflict, but not necessarily.路Power presupposes resistance. Power, first and foremost, has to do with obedience. Power is both resistance and obedience.路Power is connected with oppression and rule. Power is productive and makes development possible. Power is an evil, a good, diabolical, and routine. 
Power can never be abolished (unless we extinguish ourselves), and hence it must be decentralized.

Increasing power margins should tend to have exponential acquisition-difficulty costs.

Individual vs transindividual/Collective/emergent/corporate/systemic. Scoping is hard. 

Does power only have an interest? Not conceptually, but empirically, it is usually the case.

What is power of overselves, self-control, freewill, and the nature of subagents which comprise our [[Self-Dialectic]] vying for power internal to us?

Authority, Social Influence, Strength, Material Influence, Memetic Influence

Surrendering, antinomies of power

 as a resource to be (re)distributed, as domination, and as empowerment

power as getting someone else to do what you want them to do, that is, as an exercise of power-over, against those who define it as an ability or a capacity to act, that is, as a power-to do something. 

Channels or transition points for empowerment and disempowerment, is it power without such a thing?


[[FO]] desire and [[SO]] volitional desires over other desires (into [[infinigress]]) is the root of our power. Our power, in a sense, is perhaps always being exercised (even if the choice is to be passive).


Power is a process, property, object, relationship. Power is distributable in a large variety of ways, but it isn't always distributable.

Power varies in context. My capacity for X this context is weak, but strong in another. Perhaps my currrent context can lead to the other two, and that is weighed into my power.

The ability or extent which a thing chooses to modify or constitute the [[The Dialectic]] is power. It's not just the machinery, it's those who wield that machinery.

Power  That we can choose to do otherwise or cause others to do otherwise requires us to calculate whether or not we ought. The powerful tend to use their power to maintain and cultivate their powers over others.

What is the [[end]] of power? 
What is the power of the Unmoved Mover(s) and Final Cause? What does our power mean in relation to it? How we constitute it, and how does it constitute us?

Even in solpsism...moral intention can be computed, though it's consequences are limited. Moral autonomy in settings of multiple agents gives rise to political power.
