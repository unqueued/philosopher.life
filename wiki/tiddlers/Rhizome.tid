title: Rhizome

//I believe in [[The Beginning|The Good]] and [[The End]]. Those who wield this world are radically opposed to my vision, but I suggest I strongly appreciate what they mean anyway (my wiki is an epic example). I point to [[The Dialetheia]]: that which necessarily and externally sits beyond the limit. Oh, internalists, you are in the deepest of shit. You are welcome to have me in the dialectic with you; you need me just as much as I need you.//

A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo. The tree is filiation, but the rhizome is alliance, uniquely alliance. 

Deleuze and Guattari, //A Thousand Plateuas//

<<<
any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other, and must be. This is very different from the tree or root, which plots a point, fixes an order. â€¦ There are no points or positions in a rhizome, such as those found in a structure, tree, or root. There are only lines

Perhaps one of the most important characteristics of the rhizome is that it always has multiple entryways<<ref "k">>
