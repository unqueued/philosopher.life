title: 2018.10.17 - Wiki Audit: Template

Template needs doin'. I've built it in stages. I have most everything in place now. Going to start adding new plugins as well.

---

Apparently, "Save Page As" is just plain broken on TW now. My need to create a template is much lower now. I'm making something only possibly useful, but I'm not sure I really need to transplant myself out of this place anymore. I didn't break it. Something else did.

Auto-download modified tiddlers plugin added to this wiki. I don't mind the spam. I care that much about versioning/backups.

---

I found out why my keyboard works; I'm using a Danielo plugin for it (looking through it, I can see it does more than I knew), lol. Also, keeboord for 5.1.17. I'm hoping post pre-release, I will be able to add it. That will be a powerful addition.

[[batchmanipulator]] is live. I'm going to try to avoid being pythonic here. Let's use the tools I can find, eh?

$:/plugins/inmysocks/TiddlerTool is also live. I'm not sure batchmanipulator is even necessary with this tool. It's buggy, but fixable.

It appears autocomplete (https://snowgoon88.github.io/TW5-extendedit/#About%20the%20Edit-CompText%20plugin) is at odds with Danielo's keyboard plugin, and the keyboard plugin is necessary because I use the $:/_toggle-editor-toolbar_preview in order to overcome Tiddlywiki's iframe problem for custom embedded fonts in tiddler editor. I'm not giving up my font in my editor, thus I can't give up the editor toggle (which I actually love having anyways). I highlight text and use my hotkeys even though I know the markup language. I also think that Keeboord, which I will eventually have in this wiki, is likely to sit in conflict with the autocompletion. We shall see. 

Keeboard + autocompletion may not sit in tension. That would be sweet. In either case, I'll take native TW hotkeys over link autocompletion any day of the week.

Perhaps I could use Danielo's keyboard plugin to active the "Creative Wikilink" built into Tiddlywiki. It doesn't let me walk through the list with arrow keys, which is unacceptable.

The template is done for now. I have a tool for mass tagging. This is going to be much simpler now. Go, go, gadget.

[[j3d1h]] is working on a monthly link list that's generic (we can do it hardcoded per month). With that in hand, we will aim for a tool that automatically generates hardcoded link lists upon rendering a tiddler. With that, we can use the make new journal tiddler or even http://maketid.tiddlyspot.com/ to enormous effect, allowing us to dynamically generate our cake and statically eat it too. It follows my preferences for static/parseable content and keeping references intact.
