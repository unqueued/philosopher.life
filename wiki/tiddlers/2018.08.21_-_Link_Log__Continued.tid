* Stunning!

*** Censoring jokes isn't acceptable. Obviously, calling someone a whore is almost always immoral. I can't respect feminists who can't make the distinction.

*** ROFL
** https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-12/soviet-collapse-echoes-in-china-s-belt-and-road-investment
*** I don't think it's collapse, but I think the isolationism is increasing everywhere. The costs are there for us all.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/07/the-old-man/302984/
*** I fear I'm never going to be able to appreciate this gargantuan history.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/china-only-has-one-time-zone-and-thats-a-problem/281136/
*** Am I being an idiot here? I don't see what the big deal is. You have to make adjustments either way. There's no way out of the geopgrahical abstraction, imho.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/Ithkuil/comments/98dz27/should_i_learn_ithkuil_now/
*** If I really wanted to learn it, I should begin now. It's hard to see if this investment is really worthwhile in the end. It's a huge fucking risk. It's clear that there is deep conceptual analysis going on its categorization. Right now, I think it's important that I speak the lingua franca necessary for communicating crucial issues. The wiki must be realpolitik, at least in part.
** https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201808/the-study-why-men-stay-single-what-no-one-is-telling-you
*** Glad to see another side of it.
** https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(16)30275-3/fulltext
*** The remnants of my older conservatism still begrudgingly admits when the granola hippies are right. They really are though.

* Think About It
** https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/the-messy-democratizing-beauty-of-the-internet/567194/?single_page=true
*** Parts of the argument are fine. The thesis is obviously false. That it's TheATL gives rise to suspicion in itself.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17744228
*** Standard claims. I think the ethical issue is profound. I'm continually disappointed that people do not see it. Even plenty of socialists don't see to grasp it.
** https://culturalanalysis.net/2018/08/11/a-pragmatic-case-for-democracy/?epc_purge_single=1
*** I'm continually surprised that we can't see that money just is a subset of political power. They can't be peeled apart. Decentralizing power requires all directions.
** https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-12/american-ownership-society-is-changing-thanks-to-technology
*** There's the Bloomberg I despise. You talked about something important at least. We are renters. It's that simple. I'mma pirate though. =)
** https://newrepublic.com/article/150594/public-banks-suddenly-popular
*** Sounds at least closer to workers owning the means of production, but obviously I'm extremely doubtful.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/96vca9/i_once_asked_randall_munroe_of_xkcd_about_writing/
*** What you need then is clearing houses of professionals? I still like smart contracts in a lot of ways. They are a profoundly useful tool. In fact, anyone paying attention to the rise of technology can already see that much of the world is already embedded in pseudo-smart-contracts, they just aren't blockchained as we normally conceive of it.
** http://quanticle.net/book_reviews/2018/08/12/trust_me_im_lying.html
*** Seems like no one really knows how to define "blog," lol. Sounds about right though. I somehow am open to this generalization.
** https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/08/08/notes-nearing-ninety-learning-to-write-less/
*** Poetic. Sounds like a shit argument to me though. Am I suppose to just go "mad respect, yo"? Lol.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/technology/personaltech/turbotax-or-irs-as-tax-preparer-intuit-has-a-favorite.html
*** Obviously, I'm in favor of empowering the IRS, particularly to go after the wealthy, simplify, and make sure that the Libertarians have to provide arguments rather than mere rhetoric and manipulation.

* Fishy
** https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/north-carolina-teacher-union-strike-education-schools
*** Something feels off about it, and I can't put my finger on it. We are losing.
** https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-lenders-p2p-insight/beijing-struggles-to-defuse-anger-over-chinas-p2p-lending-crisis-idUSKBN1KX077
*** Centralization of power
** https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-09/pocket-s-30-million-users-are-great-for-publishers
*** I'm legit worried about Pocket. This is not where I wanted to see Mozilla going. These tools should be FLOSS, detached, platform agnostic, etc. This is more ecosystem baiting.
** https://debates.economist.com/debate/capitalism?state=summary
*** Ofc, it can't be socialism
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IWWAIS-tE4
*** I am always dubious of Red Scare tactics. The link to Marxism doesn't actually make any sense here. I don't see why other than to see The Economist doing it's usual thing.
** https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/adviser-admits-economy-working/
*** Yikes.
** https://washingtonmonthly.com/2018/08/07/what-democrats-still-dont-get-about-winning-back-the-white-working-class/
*** If you can't point to socialism, you really aren't trying to see the truth.
