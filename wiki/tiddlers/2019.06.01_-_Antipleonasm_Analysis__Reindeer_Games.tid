!! Respond to the following gem:

The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.

[[Saint Chomsky]] discusses this spectrum, the artificially engineered Overton Window (including the false compromises which continue to shift to the [[pright]]), often. This is one of his most famous quotes, and it deserves to be far more famous (I suppose it doesn't quite fit the spectrum of acceptable opinion well enough). I am pleased to see people who are cynical and critical of mainstream media, but it is rare that I find someone who actually attempts to cultivate and maintain access into a broader spectrum of the unsavory, unpopular, unacceptable, or unmarkable beyond false virtue signaling in their local echo chambers for maintaining social capital. The vast majority of news I get comes from word of mouth through discussions and metadiscussions about mainstream pieces (I would argue my diet is fairly mainstream though perhaps not wholly).

Appearances of progressivism are usually idpol misdirections, overcompromised demsoc-whitewashing, or far more clandestine attempts to hollow out [[pleft]]ism. Part of the reason the [[pleft]] is so disorganized is because it's not a heavily explored aspect of the spectrum. Put more eyes and minds on it, and I think it will grow eminently more practical and structured.
