I suppose it depends on what you mean by [[The Good]] and //force// here. If her definition of goodness rests solely upon being a god with maximal power to be free of both obligations and any political coercion whatsoever (including the rule of law), then I suppose her argument makes some sense.

Of course, I am all in favor of utopias that maximize our liberties. Who isn't? If you can't see the merit in the //Veil of Ignorance//, the //Ring of Gyges//, and the decentralization of power in the material dialectic, you have no access to justice necessary for maximizing liberty.

Rand is a master rhetorician.
