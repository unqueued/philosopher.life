!! Audit:

* My daughter is doing most of the writing. It's loud and clear.
* As always, the compliment section is my favorite. I love when we explicitly praise each other. 
* This skeleton of a log has become an hour-long ritual of sorts. We talk about the points.
** I'm especially glad when we all chime in on a point.
* My children are hilarious, and I can see them growing up in these logs.
** Take all the pictures you want. You can't beat this pulse.
* My wife continues to feel ill. She is often ill, always has been, even before I met her.
* My family is growing to appreciate wikis and family time more. 
* I've felt much closer to my family this month. I think we are all feeling closer.
** And, I also see more personality coming out of my offspring too. It's awesome.
* I can tell that our rituals continue to develop.
