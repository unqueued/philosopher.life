title: 2019.06.20 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Anarchist

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
As soon as one identifies, challenges and overcomes illegitimate power, he or she is an anarchist. Most people are anarchists.
<<<

This is the common definition I've found among the academics I've known. I'm fine with this claim. The followup question is what counts as a legitimate [[power]]? No, I'm not talking about the legal positivist's overbroad definition of what legitimately counts as satisfying the concept of political power. I'm talking about what counts as a morally justified power (which is what the positivists aim to sweep under the rug in my experience). Anarchists who only agree to a state of nature aren't arguing for anything more than what has already arisen in capitalism; it's yet another Rand-Locke memeplex variation.

I do not agree that most people are anarchists. I think it's easy to talk shit about a government, but it is much harder to be an effective and justified political animal. I do not see people even trying to overcome illegitimate power often enough, let alone effectively overcoming. I appreciate the inclusive desire to speak of a lowercase "a" anarchist big tent, but it's not accurate.

For example, I can find plenty of people who will poopoo American Concentration Camps in 2019, but I can't find any who would risk their lives for it. How many are willing to violently fight for the children dying in cages? I've not met a person offline yet who would (which isn't to say we know how to spend our bodies just yet). Most of the people I know are trying to avoid thinking about the awful truth at all costs because their mental health and pleasure are simply more important to them than doing the [[Right]] thing with their minds and bodies.
