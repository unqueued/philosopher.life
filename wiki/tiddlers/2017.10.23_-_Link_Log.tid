//I feel compelled to point out the inconsistencies in my thoughts in this log. Don't you see them?//<<ref "2018.12.17">>

* KYS
** https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/how-people-inside-facebook-are-reacting-to-the-companys
*** What a poor understanding of their moral responsibility. They could and should have known what they were doing and getting into long ago. This was obvious to anyone paying attention.
** https://news.vice.com/story/bill-browder-visa-revoked-putin

* Preach, yo!
** https://www.xda-developers.com/android-dns-over-tls-website-privacy/
*** How the fuck was this not standard from the beginning?
*** It's time to just restart from the beginning. We can build it. This is doable. You have to stop the obstructionist capitalists and reactionaries.
** https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-vs-gmail-security/
*** Godspeed, my dudes.
** https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/10/the-recent-catastrophic-wi-fi-vulnerability-was-in-plain-sight-for-13-years-behind-a-corporate-paywall/
** https://dymaxion.org/essays/pleasestop.html

* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.thenation.com/article/america-is-waking-up-to-the-injustice-of-cash-bail/
*** You wake too slowly from your slumber. It's already too late.
** https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qv34dp/amazons-headquarters-tax-subsidies
*** I've linked to this topic before.
** http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/10/synthetic_biology_could_lead_to_the_re_emergence_of_smallpox.html
*** Of course, I can see the idiots moved to give up their freedoms. They've missed the larger metanarratives.
** https://theintercept.com/2017/10/22/opioid-lobbyist-left-a-digital-fingerprint-on-a-campaign-by-patient-advocates/
** https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/22/facebook-google-twitter-congress-hearing-trump-russia-election
** https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-10-23/apple-losing-its-supply-chain-mojo-is-a-major-threat
*** Weren't always the Golden Child you thought they were in the first place.
** https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-strikes-deal-with-shanghai-to-build-factory-in-china-1508670181
*** Tesla Tencent knows how to make things happen.
** https://engineering.coinbase.com/you-need-more-than-one-aws-account-aws-bastions-and-assume-role-23946c6dfde3
*** You are getting locked into that ecosystem.
** https://qz.com/1103545/macarthur-genius-trevor-paglen-reveals-what-ai-sees-in-the-human-world/
*** I hear the golem coming.
** https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-u-s-is-retreating-from-religion/
*** We've known this for a long time.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/43ng4n/california-restaurant-admits-its-been-serving-popeyes-chicken-for-months
*** I might have initially found a problem with this, but I can't find a rational one beyond a margins markup. I can conceive of restaurants that have the right mix of everything I would want though, and I would pay a bit extra for that.
** https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/20/human-genome-not-fully-sequenced/
*** I'm actually not even sure what ultimately counts as a complete sequence. I fear there are significant philosophical issues at stake in even trying to answer that question.

* Fishy
** https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/more-than-1-1-billion-invisible-people-lack-identification-1765594
*** Invisibility comes in degrees. You've only touched the tip of this iceberg.
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/california-billionaire-launches-ads-urging-trump-impeachment/2017/10/20/9b5d769a-b5b6-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html
*** Why did you wait? I don't trust you.
** https://medium.com/@filip_struharik/biggest-drop-in-organic-reach-weve-ever-seen-b2239323413
*** Are you paying attention? Search and filtering information at this level should not be done for money, but it is in this case. It warps it.
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain?
*** Okay, I'm done seeing it make its way. Yes, disgusting. The echo-chamber on this one is almost unanimous.

* Neat
** https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/780p97/japans_ruling_party_is_expected_to_win_an/
*** I'm ignorant, yo, but this is how I fix it.
** https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/26/the-linux-scheduler-a-decade-of-wasted-cores/
*** It's time to be honest: we need to build load-balancing hardware. We've hit the single-thread IPS physical limits, and now growth is through decentralized computing paradigms. This is a key, yall. We already do this to some extent, but we just have to own up to it one every level of the stack. 
** https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/10/23/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-a-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex/
*** I'm slow, but I won't give up.

*** I mean...it's Gizmodo.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/787msu/cmv_people_who_see_selfishness_in_every_action_we/
*** A valuable discussion.

* Tools
** https://termux.com/
** https://isomorf.io/#!/
*** But, who the fuck wants to do that in the cloud? I want control of my data!
** https://movim.eu/
*** Again, why the cloud? I want to control my data.
** http://etherdfs.sourceforge.net/
*** Okay, should I stop posting tools which I wouldn't want to actually use? How do I know I wouldn't want to use them?

* For my daughter:

* For my wife:
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching
*** The word we couldn't remember
** http://nautil.us/issue/53/monsters/why-are-so-many-monsters-hybrids
*** Nautilus almost always //brings it//. Thought this one might suit you.
** https://readspike.com/
*** A tool for you to try out.
** https://www.tor.com/2012/06/22/what-everybody-gets-wrong-about-jekyll-and-hyde/
