!! Audit:

* It does feel like I'm doing chatlogs once a week. I think that's okay though. Since I put dates in my titles, I can do whatever the fuck I want. =)
* I have been proven wrong in my [[review]]s. That is pleasant!
* This sometimes feels like the [[/b/]]ish [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] log.
* Many of these lines do not make sense without actually throwing yourself into the context enough to read it.
* Still fucking up on [[TDL]] dating.
** I need dat button, yo.
* These are feeling very long. This log used to take me no time. That's okay though. This is my pulse here, and it needs to scale up.
* It clearly allows me to think about [[The Others]] and say something. 
** Interestingly, I do not have much meta-commentary on my relationships, and this is currently one of the only doors I regularly use to do so.
* This is a weird kind of caching on this wiki's audit CPU? Kind of.
* I can see the waves of my work, including the Thanksgiving break.
* Guitar came and went.
* It's clear that I need to work harder on ASCII/Unicode art settings for this wiki.
** I think it needs to automatically scale for each screen. I have absolutely no idea how to do that well.
** I'd love to have automatic centering and no borders as well!
** This is a project for way down the line I guess. My wiki's content probably isn't good enough to be worth making it look purty (though, functional is nice).
*** I don't want to disappoint people on phones too much though. I don't want people to hate looking at my site either. I realize ugliness turns people off, even if that isn't rational.
* I'm handling [[Deep Reading]] logs differently now.
** I think I was just jump-starting my engine and proving to myself that I was doing it.
*** Note, of course, that I have slowed down my reading considerably though. Is this related?
**** Eh, even [[Link Log]], my whore, took a serious hit this month.
* I would argue I've done a poor job of responding to people in letters for [[FTO]]. I am not being timely enough!
** Which is not to say I expect that of [[others]], but I should hold myself to a very high standard!
*** But, you are just one man, dude. It's okay. Let it go. Do what you can.
* I have set aside many projects too. Some of them are permanently gone, some postponed. So far, I'm okay with this.
