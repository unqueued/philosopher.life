title: 2017.11.06 - Yearly Audit Log: Work on Your Wiki

* I just noticed that articles for [[Realpolitik Speculation]] had their full names. They escaped the Titletag. Is that a mistake? Why not:

```
YYYY.MM.DD - Realpolitik Speculation: Title is Foobar
```

Btw, still looks like a filesystem. All day, erryday. It, of course, is.

As long as no two Titletags are ever identical (a safe assumption for now, but can be changed later): You get to have your cake and eat it too. Let's fucking do it!

Yearly Audit Log is really "Work on Your Wiki" Time. You do it systematically when you don't have that inspiration, and when you have inspiration, you just fucking go for it!

* [[Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Cleaned it up. Looks good.
** Jabba like.

* [[Yearly Audit Log]]
** Going to leave this one alone for now. I need more practice before I make decisions.

** I already recently whipped it into shape. It was nice to polish that turd.
