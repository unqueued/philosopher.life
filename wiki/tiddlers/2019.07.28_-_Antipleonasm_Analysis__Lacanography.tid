!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Lacan's definition of human deception: We deceive the Other by means of the truth itself; in a universe in which all are looking for the true face beneath the mask, the best way to lead them astray is to wear the mask of truth itself.
<<<

I don't know Lacan's work. I can like some of his moves, but you should worry I'm wildly wrong about him. Take me to task on uncharitable, reductive, and uncouth hyperread butchering.

The imaginary, the symbolic, and the real obviously relate to my notion of [[awe]]. The imaginary and symbol are Self-Dialectic, limbic and neocortex, affective and logical, etc. This is roughly the internals of who I am. The Real, however, is external to me. I fully agree to the ineffability of the real, but that's because I know also agree to the eternality, essentialness, and completeness of [[The Infinite]].<<ref "y">> I know this is just the search for meaning itself, the absolute truth, and for God. That is wildly retarded and arrogant to these people.<<ref "s">>

I'll agree the truth available to us is often not beautiful to us. I'll agree to particularism and contextualism to a radical degree, but I will not accept the denial of Foundationalism. Lacan only ever achieves a portion of the subjective because of his failure to accept universals. He is blinded by a failure to accept the necessity of faith. Truth is not an emergence of human thought or language. 2+2=4 is not a mere game, convention, or construction; it predates the physical universe.

Clearly, deception is dialectically related to the truth. Uncovering lies tells us a great deal about the truth, particularly one's motivations. Unlike Kant, I'll even agree that some deception is moral, and therefore written<<ref "w">> into the truth of the CI.

There's something especially cynically appealing about the quote. It assumes that everyone is deceiving or failing to reveal. Unfortunately, I'm not convinced you can wear the mask of truth so cleanly. It's not really a liars paradox to me. Imagine telling someone in no uncertain terms that you are telling the truth because you aim to deceive them (also part of the truth). If they believe you, you fail to deceive them. If they don't believe you, then perhaps you didn't tell the truth nearly well enough. I don't think it's paradoxical. I tend to think people tell partial truths, wear truthy masks, etc. (especially since effective liars tell the truth whenever they can), but it is possible to find fallible honesty all the way down. I'm not convinced a commitment to honesty has a strong chance of leading astray those actually looking for the truth. Of course, the real problem is that the truth is not merely some construction because it is external to us. This is game over between Lacan and I (and likely Ziz and I).
