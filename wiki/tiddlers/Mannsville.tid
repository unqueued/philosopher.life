title: Mannsville

!! About:

One of my home away from homes. I moved around a lot, as you can see. This was the first place that felt like home to me. I still treasure my memories of it many ways, although now I see it in a different light. It is a place that makes me very sad, as though I'm looking at the end of the entropy life cycle, a dying community taking its last breaths. 

Sometimes I got to see the lives of people who had escaped Mannsville, even if only to live in Cambellsville or nearby cities in a 50-mile radius. It was always a surreal experience.

!! Focus:

** The Penn family
* Poor, rough kids with nothing. 3 Brothers, like my family. Punched everyone, including girls. Had no running water, electricity, or food to eat. Even punched me once in my own yard. 

* Profound Illiteracy
** It was pervasive in the culture. My donors elected to live with the poor, but forced their children to undergo it as well (poverty is extremely bad for the minds of youth). 

* School
** 2nd-6th grade. I almost had the complete Mannsville Elementary experience

** Fun
*** Spelling-bee
*** Track-and-Field days
**** Tug-of-war winning both grades (only class to do it)
*** The basketball courts and baseball field
*** 4-Square

** 2nd Grade - Mrs. Mosely
*** Mean. Hated the hotshot autistic kid especially. Underdog lover.
*** Pencil+Doorslam in her throat story (don't know if it was true or not)
*** Loved when I was wrong, and would purposely try to never even given partial credit to me.
**** Writing my journal in pig latin
**** Grape stems (called them vines) in our "feel and guess" blind game.
**** Combinations of coins to make a dollar; I was off by one (I read it in a book; she sat down and wrote them out).
*** Ricking Wood
*** Eventually became the Principle.

** 3rd Grade - Mrs. Smith
*** Only for Math/Reading. They kept 2nd/3rd Graders clustered together.
*** Baby Club. Curveball she threw at me.
*** Apple II computers
*** Witty, Sarcastic.

** 4th Grade - Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Brockman??
*** Crazy. Treated me like a god-son she wished was her own. Very odd woman. Schizotypal
*** Replaced her at end of year with a useless woman who could barely read.

** 5th Grade - Mrs. Woods

** 6th Grade - Mrs. Woods + Mrs. Richardson
*** I have no idea why I had two teachers. How did they afford this? I do not understand. 
*** My first B. =( I'm not perfect.

* Mrs. Wise
** Gifted and Talented teacher who came once a week to visit us.
** Wrecked that IQ test they gave me. I thought it was fun. Filled with puzzles. Quant was my strong suit (which is hilarious because I've never even learned calculus). My quant skills got wrapped up and twisted into trying to solve philosophical problems and untangle the lies my donors fed me for decades.

** Years later, I showed up, coincidentally, for the closing of the school. It was a weird day. None of my teachers were happy to see me, lol.
