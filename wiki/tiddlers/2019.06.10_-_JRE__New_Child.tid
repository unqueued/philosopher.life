Ever have your milk go bad so you have to pour it out in the sink/toilet and it just slides out in watery lumps?  That's what my bm was like this morning...

Literally pulled my car over to the side of the road to text you that.
JUN 10 6:23 AM
Lol!
JUN 10 10:35 AM
Perfectly disgusting.
JUN 10 10:36 AM
I hope it solidifies for you. Makes it hard to be productive when you are running to the john all day.
JUN 10 10:37 AM

JUN 10 10:17 PM
Does Kyla walk yet?
JUN 10 10:17 PM
Does she speak?
JUN 10 10:18 PM
How'd you get her to sleep?
JUN 10 10:18 PM
Rebecca sat with her for an hour and a half, then I took her for 20, during which she screamed for 18 minutes.
JUN 10 10:22 PM
=(
JUN 10 10:22 PM
Sorry man. That sucks.
JUN 10 10:22 PM
When rebecca came back, kyla was so exhausted from crying, she went to sleep in 3 min lol
JUN 10 10:22 PM
That is an incredibly emotional sound for everyone.
JUN 10 10:22 PM
Lol. That happens!
JUN 10 10:23 PM
Wearin' em out.
JUN 10 10:23 PM
Don't forget your hearing PPE.
JUN 10 10:23 PM
She calls everything mama, that's her only word
JUN 10 10:23 PM
I don't know the rules you feel obligated to play by, but there are time periods where I put my kids in the room and let them cry it out. Hopefully, she will nap a bunch for you.

My brother is picking up a new foster child in a few hours. 17th months old, alcoholic mother, and the father allowed her to take of the child against court orders. My brother is told this is a very short term, temporary placement. I have no idea what the length will be, but this may just be a warning shot across the father's bow. Rebecca is headed to a conference for 4 days, so my brother will be taking care of the toddler on his own.

We talked a bit about what the child might be like at that age (though perhaps my brother knows already). 

My brother is anxious but not freaked out. I hear a great deal coming back to race through him. He wishes he was on his older meds since he felt hopeful on those but not so much on these. He is contemplating the possibility that this won't work at all. I am more hopeful than he is right now, but I can't see as much as he can.

From what I can tell, this is an excellent test. It's short term, it's not a commitment, and it's a great way to test the waters again. 

He said he had to get out of his own head, and he was going to take a shower. I told him he can call me at any time (which is always true, but I wanted to remind him). He doesn't need to spend every waking moment with the child, and I said he should not feel bad about having some computer time. 

I don't know if I was useful to my brother, but I tried to be.
