title: 2019.07.01 - Prompted Introspection: Season, Winter This Time

!! What is your favorite season? Why?

Jesus. Not this again, Samwise: [[2018.11.08 - Prompted Introspection: Seasons, Again.]]. Fine. `/cointoss` (actually, tossed a USB drive couple times): Winter is my favorite season. Um, I like the lower electricity costs, not feeling too warm, my offspring's birthdays, the various reminders of what it's like to live another year, the beauty of snow on mountains, and having another reason for my wife to snuggle.
