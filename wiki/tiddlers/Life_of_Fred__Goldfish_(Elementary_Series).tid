title: Life of Fred: Goldfish (Elementary Series)

The children covered this one together. I listened while they read. My son still struggles at times, but the rate has not changed. He still understands the concepts and deductions very quickly. He often answers the questions faster than his sister (although, she isn't throwing down). 

We had a particular problem my daughter didn't want to do because it took a lot of work. I asked her to automate it programmatically instead. Let's hope she starts enjoying that.

Measurements and geometry showed up nicely in this book, currency as well. There was a lot of previewing of multiplication. I'm hoping the mental math sticks.
