title: Apology

I want to apologize for what I said in our last meeting and for not staying in contact with you until Christmas. I was not being as empathic as I want to be. My goal is to be deeply empathic, especially with those I love you. I'm really sorry. I hope you can forgive me. I'm doing the best I can with what I have, even though it hasn't been sufficient. I hope I can undo the damage I've done. 

I thought I was allergic to you. I realize that much of who I am is a reflection, reaction to, and consequence of who you are. My crucial mistake: I didn't like myself, and I took that out on you. I saw in you what I saw in myself. I've been allergic to myself. I need to adapt. I've been working really hard to reintegrate myself and put my life back together. I'm sorry I said what I did. There are times where we would sacrifice a great deal to take our words back, and I'm incredibly sorry that I can't unsay it to you. I lacked the empathy in that moment. That is not who I am trying to be. I'm very sorry. 

You may be asking, what about the other stuff we spoke about in those two days? Are you going to apologize for all of that? You may not like this part: I apologize for the way I said it, the place I was coming from when I delivered the content to you. A suicidal man with no sense of purpose is not always in the state of mind he wants to be in. I felt like a trapped animal in fight-or-flight mode, and I did not kindly and carefully explain myself. Unfortunately, I still agree with the vast majority of the content of what I said. I wish I said it in a way that generated mutual understanding instead of anger. I'm sorry that I've been a poor communicator with you.
