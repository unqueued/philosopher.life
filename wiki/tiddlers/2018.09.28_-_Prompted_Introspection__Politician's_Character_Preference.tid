title: 2018.09.28 - Prompted Introspection: Politician's Character Preference

!! What characteristics or personality traits are most important to you in a politician?

Due to her anticodificationism, inarticulist-stance, and non-cognitivism, Hursthouse clearly does not understand how ideal moral virtue is unified. Of course, as we contextualize to the [[fff]], being as morally virtuous as one can in one's circumstances will demonstrate essentially a kaleidoscope of shards of virtue which are equally permissible in their perfection for that person. However, I suggest they tend to have a hell of a lot in common, including a fuckton (that's a technical word in ethics) of disposition built on both theory and practice of [[The Moral Law]].

I think politicians must be //The Statesman//, the Philosopher King, the wisest of political animals, etc. They need to be wicked smaht [[irwartfrr]], having habituated their fastminds to have virtuous perception in applying [[The Golden Rule]] in their particular political contexts. There be you a technical non-answer, Samwise. But, what do you expect? This is virtue theory; you can say everything while saying nothing. It's gorgeously useless like that in metaethics. I wish I could escape relying upon it, but the description it provides us of our moral psychology is simply too valuable (even if the Neo-Aristotelians are dead fucking wrong).
