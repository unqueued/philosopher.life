title: 2017.12.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Escape

!! What's your favorite place to escape from life temporarily? A park? A mall?

Samwise, are you retarded? =) Do you know me at all? Why the fuck would I go outside into the world of people unless I'm forced? I'm hikikomori. I escape the world inside my own home. I don't really escape life often on my computer anymore; it's all bidness there. My temporary escape from my life is through a dissociative called //Deschloroketamine//.<<ref "1">>

I escape my life temporarily by taking a drug that allows me to not be myself within my own headspace. The average person doesn't have a fucking clue what it means to escape life. (*Get woke, sheeple. :P)
