title: 2018.12.26 - Wiki Audit: Bob

I've been working on other things, and I have accomplished what I set out to accomplish by the end of the year. I'm still hoping to get Bob and TW upgraded, but it doesn't look like Bob is ready for it. This is unfortunate. I'm betting Jed is hesitant here since 5.1.18 was a complete flop, and it's possible 5.1.19 will be as well. I don't know. Maybe I should just dive in?
