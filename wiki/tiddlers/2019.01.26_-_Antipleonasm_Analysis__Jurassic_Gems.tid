!! Respond to the following gem:

Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should.

Science is a tool. You can use it for good or evil, right or wrong, pleasure or pain, etc. We must still ask what is morally necessary about the pile of possibilities. What is obligated and permissible?  Ironically, it is the question a scientist can answer (sorry naturalists). 

The "is" of the "ought" isn't like any physical object we can test. I do not deny it requires empiricism to explore or find though.

I suggest most of the STEMlords I've met don't give 2-shits about the Humanities. I hear lipservice from some, but it's rare to see them really wrestle with it.

I give you a salute, `/salute`, you mindful scientists. You are gems among us.
