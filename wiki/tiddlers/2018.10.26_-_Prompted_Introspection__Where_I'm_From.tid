title: 2018.10.26 - Prompted Introspection: Where I'm From

!! Where are you from?

I must admit, I've done an awful job in filling out {[[Vault]]}. I know these memories, distorted as they may be, are being ripped out of me as I age and lose my mind. I already feel like my plate is incredibly full. 

When someone asks, "Where are you from?" I often have to give them a disappointing answer: "all over." I moved often as a PK. No place has really been home to me, though some places have been more influential or important to me than others. In a sense, "where I'm from" isn't something which directly defined me in a way that is easy for me to tease apart, but I guarantee my lack of a satisfactory answer to this question has defined me. I really do feel like an alien.
