title: 2017.09.30 - Retired: About

Hello world. I am [[h0p3]]. I am rebooting my life. Sometimes life feels like an impossible task, the //Non sequitur// of //non sequiturs//. I am not stable, but I feel certain I need hope. Hope must be the zeroth of axioms. Hope is the spark of autonomy. It is who I am and who I will be. There is a fire in my belly, and I am hungry again. I must find the musical signal in the noisy chaos. I am an existential beast, and this is the Cartesian [[nexus|Nexus]] of my gritty unification. ("Bootloader complete!") Welcome to my wiki!<<ref "1">>  

I'm not sure how to define this wiki. This is my tiny corner of the internet. It's basically a semi-formal blog in wiki format that I use as a stream-of-consciousness journal and thought-sandbox. It's a collection of [[projects|Projects on this Wiki]] and narratives of who I was, who I am, and who I think I should be.<<ref "2">> This wiki is an application of those famously axiomatic, aphoristic maxims: "[[Know Thyself]]" and "[[Virtue is Knowledge]]." I'm here to examine my life (and I hope to find it worth living).

Okay, why a wiki? 

Well, the dimensionality and programmability of this wiki medium is well-suited to the way I think (imho, the way we all think [maybe there are better tools]) because:

# This wiki allows me to nest the web of my thoughts, beliefs, desires, feelings, definitions, inferences, theories, paradigms, etc. in a non-linear way.
# I can mirror my [[reality map|Reality map]] onto these wiki-pages; i.e. the wiki allows me to reify and consciously object-orientify my reality map. 
# This is an attempt to isomorphically link my reality map to a representative set of words that I can more objectively explore.
# It gives me a detailed and structured self-shadow for analysis and restructuring; it is an existential mirror I can gaze into.
# It's a therapeutic mind-mapping and pattern-recognition tool; it is a vehicle for philosophical meditations. 
# It is existential equipment for me;<<ref "3">> it is a lifetool for living a contemplative life.

This wiki has opened up a better way to express myself in self-reflection. While I'm still figuring out how to harness this self-reflection, and I don't yet know the direction of this wiki,<<ref "4">> I do at least know //why // I am learning and using this existential equipment:

The goal of this wiki is to make myself explicit to myself. I'm here to have a conversation with myself. I'm creating an evolving communication feedback loop between myself and this wiki. In an important way, this may be just what [[conscious experience|Consciousness]] is like (although traditionally entirely in one's mind), and I want to make sure I afford myself the opportunity to think about my thoughts on a higher order and to more objectively inspect the narratives I tell myself. This wiki is where I get to hear myself think. I want to learn from my own writing.

Writing this wiki gives me the chance to openly evaluate my own definitions, feelings, intuitions, and the consistency-levels in my web of beliefs and inferences. In here, I am compelled to serialize my internal data, transfer it onto these pages, run analysis algorithms on it, and rewrite these pages (rinse and repeat). I hope I am writing a "philosophical program" to teach myself the results of my analysis, to hold my analysis accountable by opensourcing it, and to see further in myself. It is an experiment in public consciousness. Importantly, I'm making myself explicit because I'm searching for epiphany, paradigm shifts, and catharsis. Ultimately, in making myself explicit, I hope to shape myself, to empathize with myself, and to make myself happier through reason. This is as much a practical exercise as it is a theoretical one. I desperately need it too.

I'm experiencing severe existential crisis and depression, and I have been for a while.<<ref "5">> I've been thrashing around and drowning at sea while trying to build an existential liferaft from nothing but myself. I hope I have found the right [[metamodern|Metamodernism]] vehicle to save myself from drowning; I think I have. This wiki is a lifetool; it will help me build that liferaft. I have disintegrated, and I hope this lifetool will aid in my reintegration. 

This wiki is meant to be an existential laboratory, a safe space where I freely deliberate with myself, where I peel myself apart through analysis and integrate myself through synthesis. Here I attempt to systematically weave the weft and warp of my intuitions into a consistent and meaningful whole (for myself). I will escape my crisis by consolidating and shaping my personality or reality map into a new (improved, happier) version of myself. I will collect myself, organize my internal structures, focus, and redirect myself. I hope this lifetool will help me existentially reconstitute myself. It sounds grandiose, but I really am in the fight for my life.

So far, I have been living for my children.<<ref "6">> As much as I want to die, I can't do that to them. They need me, and I can't help them if I'm not there for them. I care about their lives. Their happiness is my happiness. I do care about my happiness. I care about my life, and that's why I write this wiki. The hardwork that goes into this wiki is meant to benefit them, and thus as a means to my children as my ends, also the real, authentic me: the "me" identity which persists through time. I am here to empathize with and help that person.<<ref "7">> I need it.<<ref "8">>

Unfortunately, exactly what counts as me is still not clear (to me [lol, no but seriously: [[Know Thyself]]]). Personal identity is a very tricky set of metaphysical and metaethical problems. We all have common sense understandings of it. Of course, from an instrumental perspective, we simply must have at least some common sense intuitions about these matters to be practical and live in the world. Obviously, just because we have a common sense view doesn't mean it is correct or justified (nor have I established anything categorically normative so far). Unfortunately, [[intuitionism|Intuitionism]] is an inescapable quagmire. It is part of our [[human plight|Human Plight]].

From my research and introspection, it is my opinion that human minds are not monolithic, but rather they are the result of multiple minds (or mind-like processes) joined in cooperation with each other.<<ref "9">> In particular, our brains have a strong regional divide in them between what I call the [[Fastmind]] and the [[Slowmind]].<<ref "10">> The Slowmind is found in our frontal lobes. The Slowmind is our primary CPU. That's where the grind happens. The Fastmind is the storage unit of our intuition data (where we store the rainbow tables of our Slowmind's grind). It is where we store, habituate, and train our fastest deep learning neural networks; it is where virtue-data is stored.<<ref "11">> This is the place in the human brain that virtuous experts rely upon; it is the [[submind]] they query to intuitively come up with the right answers in the blink of an eye. We all do this, and I believe I rely heavily upon intuition as an INTJ. 

I am convinced that the Fastmind is composed of different [[Intuition networks]] which may themselves be minds of sorts (or at least contain the content of our reality maps, the gutteral data input to our Slowmind algorithm). These intuition networks can sit in conflict with each other, and I believe at least two of mine are at war. I refer to one of my intuition networks as the [[Redpilled Intuition Network]] (RPIN) and the other as the [[Kantian Intuition Network]] (KIN). My intuitions are deeply incompatible with each other: it's why I feel ripped in half. The cataclysm between RPIN and KIN has been the epicenter of my existential crisis.

I can see the collision between my competing intuition networks; they are the tectonic plates colliding on my reality map. I must find the answer. I must find the antidote. I am in a race with myself to diffuse the bomb inside me before I self-destruct. The core of my computer network is crashing, and I have to hack it back together in this space. I must compatibilize them. I must find peace and agreement between them. Hopefully, I will be able to meet myselves halfway in this wiki. I must find the anchors to which both intuition networks can tether. I need to let the collisions between my competing intuition networks happen on the pages of this wiki rather than in myself. I can feel detached from it, at least a smidgen. I need that space to solve the problem. This wiki is a scaffold around myself, an operating room. Paradoxically, I am the operator(s) and operatee(s). Through self-surgery ("scalpel!"), I must unify myself. I must rewrite my lifestory and stitch together who I was and who I will be with someone I can accept and empathize with.

I hope that having a conversation with myself will be the real fix. In addition to the standard evolving pages of this wiki (and hopefully myself), there will be a unique dialogue in this wiki. I will have an overt philosophical and practical dialogue between myselves; I will engage in the Platonic tradition by animating my [[RPIN the Psychopathic Pragmatist|RPIN]] and [[KIN the Empathic Idealist|KIN]] selves as characters. RPIN and KIN will engage in an existential [[dialectic|Dialectic]]. It is a kind of roleplaying with or in myself, a way to offload myselves into a hypothetical social sphere to inspect. RPIN and KIN are virtual machines that I'm hosting, and I am the penetration tester (I realize the analogy is far from perfect). Sometimes I may need to be an observer, like I would watching a movie or reading a book, and think about these characters from a dissociated standpoint where I learn to empathize with myselves (sounds dangerous, [[Operatoree]]). 

Sometimes I feel like RPIN and KIN are on my shoulders; RPIN is the devil, and KIN is the angel. When I can't resolve the conflict, when they don't agree, then I must choose one. How do I know which one is actually correct though? I don't know. I have to try to find an answer. It is an awful, weird feeling to be so unable to trust yourself. I must identify and empathize with my persisting identity, then I must empathize with these characters, and maybe help them empathize with each other. If I cannot convince them, then I have to empathize with the need for the conflict in myself. I'm hoping this is how I can heal myself.

In my self-reflection, I hope to engage in a process of respectful internal adversarialism which will help me logically, rationally, kindly, and empathically resolve my internal conflict. My competing intuition networks must find peace with each other. My mother says that one mark of a genius is the ability to simultaneously hold two diametrically opposed ideas (despite the irrationality of a literal interpretation, there seems to be a ring of intuitive truth to the spirit of her claim). Unfortunately, I can't hold on much longer (I'm just not that smart). My only hope is to weld these opposing ideas, the //Doxa// of //doxa// and the //Doxa// of //praxis//, together inside the crucible of this wiki. I don't want to be a genius (or even half of one). I just want peace and happiness. Please. So, paradoxically, this is me throwing my gauntlet down at everything, including myselves. I'm going to unify myself or die trying. This is the empathization of my internal war for the sake of self-peace. 

I hope that by mirroring my reality map onto this wiki, I will be able to coordinate my opposing [[intuition networks|Intuition Networks]], find compromises between them, and make them compatible with each other. My goal is to hierarchically re-intregate myself. I must decisively align my many orders of desires and beliefs in a resounding commitment, securing conformity between them, and wisely synchronizing and unifying them. I'm reprogramming myself. I seek to be an authentic, autonomous, unified, and whole person. I hope this wiki is a reforming, healing, cleansing, therapeutic, reifying, rationalizing, and vindicating existential programming instrument or development environment through which I resolve conflicts in myself,<<ref "12">> clear my vision, discover fitting lifepaths over time, and hopefully find happiness. 

Essentially, in my analysis of my first existential axioms, those truisms: [[Know Thyself]] and [[Virtue is Knowledge]], I hope I have taken up two other axioms, namely: [[Empathize with Yourself]] and [[Program Yourself]]. [[Empathize with Yourself]] is the means to employing the [[Categorical Imperative]], a necessary decision procedure engine we rely upon to know what is virtuous. Further, [[Program Yourself]] is the means to long-term happiness. Both my starting axioms are clearly deeply related to these two new ones.

<<<
[[RPIN]]: Whoa. Hold up. By implementing the Categorical Imperative [[Our Dear Programmer]] [[(h0p3)|h0p3]] is clearly begging the question in favor of [[KIN]].
<<<
<<<
[[KIN]]: You get to call me out when I'm being a hypocrite though. We aren't in the liar's paradox; you're facing the opposite. You know that if I'm following the method (can I actually directly hide anything from you, from myself? I'm not talking about denial through indirect doxastic voluntarism either), that I must empathize with you. Even if you are psychopathic, I'd need to empathize with you. We have established nothing in the Categorical Imperative otherwise. You know I have to give you a fair shake. I'm worth trusting because you can see how I really feel: you know me. You have to trust me; you have to trust yourself.
<<<
<<<
[[RPIN]]: Call me paranoid. Fine. I have seen true Kant scholars, and not one can clearly defend empathizing with psychopaths. I do not have reasons to believe you will empathize with me. How will you [[Empathize with a Psychopath]]? I will at least admit this: it seems very logical to empathize with yourself. That is clearly what it means to care about your persistent identity. It is clear to me that I am a persisting identity. I buy the [[Program Yourself]] axiom. We can't afford to be impulsive. We must maximize the scope of our utility calculation; we must yet again ("Pinky") engage in long-term planning. 
<<<
<<<
[[KIN]]: It seems obvious to me that you cannot [[Program Yourself]] if you don't at least [[Know Thyself]]. It seems further obvious that to [[Know Thyself]] just is to [[Empathize with Yourself]]. 
<<<
<<<
[[RPIN]]: I am not foolish enough to assume knowledge of a mind is empathizing with that mind. Some psychopaths can have excellent theories of mind but elect to empathize only when it benefits them (because they are empathizing with their future selves). Ultimately, I agree to [[Know Thyself]], of course, but that does not mean we can logically derive [[Empathize with Yourself]]. That is to say to say: you have not established the categorical claim that we ought to feel the emotions and consequent motivations which go along with our knowledge. That is not obviously utility maximizing. Also, don't you know our [[Slowmind]] love's utilitarianism (that's where it is found)? Face it: Kantianism only exists in the Fastmind. You are a slave, you are not the rational, you are epiphenomal, you are not the most rational part of ourselves.
<<<
<<<
[[KIN]]: It is true that I don't care about utility maximizing until after the [[Good Will]]. This is not an accident. It is the only thing which is unconditionally good. But, you are right: the Frontal Lobes problem is huge. I do not know how to answer that. See? I am empathizing with you. You know we agree on the metaethical inferences, you just don't agree to the axioms. 
<<<
<<<
[[RPIN]]: That is correct. So, how about this: [[Program Yourself]] is talking about the only kind of freedom we have. You have seen the neuroscience behind what you call freedom. It doesn't exist.  Your freedom is unjustified faith. It is an axiom, and not obviously one I must take up.
<<<
<<<
[[KIN]]: Ugh, yes. The Categorical Imperative, if it is truly rational, must resolve the problem of freedom to make it axiomatic for you. I grant you that is at least one of the fundamental axioms we must show. I think it is the only way to convince you that [[Empathize with Yourself]] is the logical consequence of [[Know Thyself]].
<<<
<<<
[[RPIN]]: Here's the other half of this deep problem: I'm the one who actually agrees to the axiom [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. Your stutterstepped denial of Hanlon's razor shows  you only kind of do. More problematically, knowledge is not empathy, and virtue just means excellence. It doesn't mean CI-based moral excellence (again, utility seems an obvious possibility).
<<<
<<<
[[KIN]]: We are trying to program each other. I'm glad we are doing it publicly.
<<<

At this point, I feel compelled to explain what may seem like an odd inconsistency in my approach to privacy throughout this wiki. Namely, I care so much about privacy (as an ethical and political right) and yet I am obviously oversharing so absurdly publicly (it is perhaps cringeworthy). Well, this is my outlet, an effective conduit between myselves, and there is a method to the madness. This is me putting my money where my mouth is. There is a reason for transparently and openly shaping myself: sunlight is the best disinfectant.

Of course, I'm not saying anyone but me really cares about this wiki. Importantly, even if I might be speaking out in the dark with nobody there to listen, it would still be a good thing that I'm speaking out in the dark. Whether I'm talking to a void, myself, or other, acting as if someone is reading this or may be reading this somehow puts me in the right mindset. It feels like I'm addressing an audience instead of myself, and that helps me better realize how and when I need to be clearer, more rational, and more empathic. It forces me into a mode of public reasoning where I hopefully more fairly and objectively negotiate, integrate, and reprogram myself. Even if nobody is listening to me, I should listen to myself. I need to empathize with myself.

Essentially, this wiki is an accountability-based, high-transparency, cryptographically verifiable implementation of the [[Categorical Imperative]].<<ref "13">> I have to ask myself in a space of actual public reasoning (not merely the hypothetical possible world or moral courtroom we enter into in our internal implementations of the Categorical Imperative) if this is who I ought to be, if this is what I ought to do, if rational persons //in my position //would agree to my claims, acts, and intentions. Think about it: if we all wrote our journals and shaped ourselves in public, wouldn't the world be a better place and wouldn't people in general be better people? I am no exception. So, while I respect privacy rights (and find them exceedingly necessary for our world), I'm electing to relinquish mine because I feel compelled by practical wisdom.

The practical point is this: I want to construct my narrative, edit my reality map, and shape my personality in a public setting directly because it's much harder to confabulate "reasons" to selfishness (or other mistakes) when people are paying attention.<<ref "14">> Intellectual and moral integrity is all about trying to apply standards we believe rational people independent of us would accept and use.<<ref "15">> This is an application of the golden rule, and essentially, of empathizing with the rational, and of loving wisdom ([[Virtue is Knowledge]]).

Even if only for myself, ''I h0p3'':

*I hope this wiki develops into an evolving internet rabbithole, a grounds for me to explore and adapt.
*I hope this self-dialectic blooms into insight porn and footnote paradise.
* I hope I can "get it out of me" here.
*I hope this is a place to get to know me (even if only for me to accept myself).
*I hope this is a place to explicitly see my reality map in words and to see that landscape improve (and my life with it).
*I hope I effectively communicate with myself in open, curious, charitable, and humble self-reflection.
*I hope this wiki is a Living Document.
*I hope this is the place where I wisely mediate and reconcile the differences between my practical ([[RPIN]]) and idealistic ([[KIN]]) [[intuition networks|Intuition Networks]].
*I hope I re-invent myself and plan my grind through life and cognitive dissonance in this existential laboratory. 
* I hope to be a jedi metagamer of my life, to be practically "meta" about my existence, to play the game of life like a video game I'm obsessed with, and to more successfully engage in the practice of [[metaliving]]; thus perhaps I want this to be a Metaliving Document.
*I hope I can become a [[eudaimonic lifehacker|Eudaimonic Lifehacker]] who is existentially fulfilled (perhaps in seeking the Dao of Gödel).
*I hope that one day this [[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]] page is happier in both appearance and //telos//.
*I hope I am [[h0p3]].

Wherever this hermeneutic circle (or spiral) takes me, as part of this continual existential process of rebirthing and reawakening, I will engage in the practice of programming myself and my reality. My goal is to be [[autonomous|Autonomy]] and authentic. I want to be my own programmer. I want to be the author of my life. I want to be the legislator of my own laws (literally what autonomy means). I want to be free and happy. I'm here to fight for that freedom and to stoically accept in empathy what I can't control. 

Needless to say, this wiki is currently (and hopefully often and always) under construction. Expect wiki-pages to be created, edited, and removed.<<ref "16">> This wiki is a living document (and a document for metaliving; I suppose it sounds weird to call it a Living Metaliving Document). Since I change, so will my wiki. The organization of this wiki is constantly in flux as I try to reposition the jigsaw pieces of my reality map. 

Problematically, I am often wrong. Do you hear me? //''__Listen__''//: ''I am going to be wrong on this wiki because I am often wrong IRL.'' The whole point of the wiki is to help me distinguish what is right from what is wrong. Be gracious! Be empathic! Be understanding! You can't be perfect (no one can), even though you should strive to be. Please understand the wiki as an //evolving// thing (just like our lives). Do your best (paradoxically, who doesn't?).

To only add confusion to the problem: I often fail to say what I really mean, and much of my work looks like a jumble (I'm sorry). I'd like to warn you in advance: I am prone to employ and develop a jargony personal language on this wiki in order to be laconic, unambiguous, and maximize the space and detail of my expressivity (even if only with and for myself). Sometimes I need to be as exacting with myself as I can be.

However, it became clear to me that part of my deep conflict with them is also a deep conflict within myself. This wiki could and should be much more than a letter to my parents. After more reflection, I have realized this wiki was inspired by some other lifetools I've used, e.g. my <a href='h-book.7z'>H-book</a> (with <a href='h-book.sum'>checksum</a> and <a href='h-book.sum.sig'>sig</a>).

<<footnotes "2" "That sounds ridiculously narcissistic. I really don't mean it that way. Unfortunately, journals have to be egocentric in a way, but that doesn't make them narcissistic tools. Really, my statement is an aspiration, not a claim that I've achieved anything worth reading. I'm well aware of the fact that writing an autobiography borders on outrageous lunacy. Admittedly, I want to steer away from that //icky//, ludicrous, lack of humility. I must say it up front: of course, I run the risk of going off the deep end here. At the very least, I don't want this wiki to be a:  rambling vanity trap, public masturbation session, absurd pile of emo-bullshit, diatribe, agitprop, manipulative virtue-signal, popularity contestant, newage holytext, self-defeating piece of self-help, mere language game, delusional confabulation, useless maze, descent into madness, or a tool used for evil things. But, ultimately, I need to take my life seriously at some level. Unfortunately, because I'm a 'quirky' (or insane) mama-jama, I need a very low-level, detailed, highly structured, hierarchical understanding of life and myself, from the ground up. So, I'm not here to convince anyone but myself, but I also don't think I'm doing anything morally wrong by taking my life so seriously.">>

<<footnotes "3" "I am not a Heidegger scholar. I am fascinated by what he is doing though. To be as precise as I can (with the caveat of my poor and corrupted understanding of Heidegger), I see this wiki as a unique kind of equipment that serves as a portal between [[ready-to-hand|[[Ready-to-Hand]] and [[present-at-hand|Present-at-Hand]] modes for me, i.e. a [[RtH-PaH-portal]]. Some things jerk us out of the ready-to-hand into the present-at-hand mode (and some the other direction, and perhaps some in both directions). Not all [[RtH-PaH-portals|RtH-PaH-portal]] have the same destinations (there may be many different instances, aspects, or points of view one can 'arrive at' in either mode). I suspect what things count as portals (and the function-rules which map their destinations) are different for everyone, but there may also be natural portal patterns that arise in a species of creatures with very similar brain structures. In any case, some of those portals bring us into a present-at-hand mode in which Dasein is [[thinking about thinking|Thinking About Thinking]] and [[thinking about existence|Thinking About Existence]]. This wiki is one of those more existentially focused/destined  [[RtH-PaH-portals|RtH-PaH-portal]] which I'm purposely trying to use. I must heighten my self-awareness like Goku with his martial art (/cringe). I need equipment for bringing me into a scientifically (because we can't get Husserl's core: certainty) philosophical mindset about my existentence. I need equipment when I arrive at that destination to do my work in there. There is a ready-to-handedness (RtHness) I'm trying to cultivate in my present-at-handedness (PaHness) towards my existence. I need to make it easier to be self-reflective and existential, to the point that it is a reflex. I need to be a master of it (10,000 hours, they say) to the point that it becomes unproblematic, fundamental, ingrained, and the natural way of doing it for me. I need that RtHness, being 'in the zone,' while I'm being existential. I hope this wiki is that special equipment, acting as an existential portal for me.">>
