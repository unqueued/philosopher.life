!! About:

Here I talk about the computational technical aspects and existence of my wiki. This is less to do with {[[Principles]]} of construction for the semantics and more to do with the infrastructure of this distributed computer.

!! Principles:

* Engage in the scientific method.
* Make it easy to reconstruct and improve this infrastructure.

!! Focus:

* [[lighttpd.conf for this Wiki's Host]]
* [[Wiki: Scripts]]
* [[ATL: Crontabs]]
* [[Tiddlywiki Google Group Forum]]
