* Stunning!
** https://tinyletter.com/thealiporepost/letters/1054
*** I've run across this more than once now. It still has me by the balls.
*** Linked in [[hope]]. Will think more on it.
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs
*** Holy shit! It's real. I've been waiting for a long time. I don't like how he didn't get to play against the same agent for multiple games. I don't like how the optics are so clearly managed here. The same happened with the other different games as well. Still, this was amazing.
** https://libraryofbabel.info/
*** There are other such thought-experiments I've seen for compressed images and music. This is one of the reasons I'm radically opposed to intellectual property.

* Preach, yo!
** https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49238/the-quiet-world
*** God damn. It's killing me. Thank you, Sir [[kicks]].

* Confirm My Bias
** http://www.coconutpoetry.org/lin1.htm
*** On the daring assumption that I have understood this.

* Think About It
** https://href.cool/Games/Cards/
*** "every hand is like a new world unfolding before you. I don’t know."
**** Insofar as domains can be limited, yes. It may just be a combinatoric doorway into a larger world of worlds. There are many stories which cardboard can tell.
** https://href.cool/Games/Strategy
*** "I fear that a section like this will come off as selling products—because I’ll inevitably link to elaborate commercial games. No, no, not so—I expect you to fashion your own bootleg versions from index cards and acorn caps."
**** Either use a sharpie or print out extremely high-quality magic forgeries to play with. Digital life has made it much better.
** https://math.uchicago.edu/~wald/
*** Hardcore. I am reminded of a book my donors bought me a long time ago when they saw I stopped caring about mathematics (which was my best subject for the longest time). It's painful to see this.
** https://href.cool/Real/Alphanumerics
*** "A digit is tiny and invisible. But we think it’s the realest thing."
**** Regardless of the [[dok]] I agree or disagree (or understand at all), I adore this claim. Of course, I would. Signs are my plight.
** https://href.cool/Stories/Poems/
*** I have no business here. I'll do my best.
*** I still cannot define poetry well enough. I'm all ears.
*** http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=69217
**** Where my verbal and social reasoning becomes true garbage, imho.
*** https://interstellar-superunknown.blogspot.com/2018/06/bil-sabab-power-hour-cant-translate.html
**** I have pissed off a number of philosophers with my opinion on the nature of translation; poetry and jokes are the first thing we point to. I'm a pure heathen.
** https://kottke.org/16/08/kanye-wests-poem-about-mcdonalds
*** Yet another Kottke. Kanye keeps showing up too. =)
** https://aekstionnahhruohten.wordpress.com
*** The blood on page 10 drives the point home. Gorgeously paranoic "encrypted" textart. I cannot say I understand it the real story (without irony).
*** https://old.reddit.com/user/CZ3A1T
**** Reminds me of sorcery of the spectacle territory too.
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDnSGnl29vo
*** I don't see why I should care. I don't understand why [[K]] thinks this counts as a good story. Good writers tend to be good readers, and I'm not seeing it here.
** https://href.cool/Supernatural/Mischief/
*** "There is something bizarre and curious or repellant about these things that shocks you into and out of reality. (I think of virtual realities as supernatural places."
**** Do you mean ontologically, epistemically, or phenomenologically supernatural?
** https://www.youtube.com/user/TheScariestMovieEver/
*** Almost no reddit posts referencing with these YT view numbers. Seems odd to me, but that channel is all kinds of odd.

* Interesting
