title: E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial

//My brother [[JRE]] likes to tease me about this film. Most people think I'm profoundly mistaken. Yall's crazy. This movie's fucked up!//

Hear ye, hear ye:

//E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial// is a ''horror'' film, E.T. is a malevolent creature, and we've been conditioned to perceive it otherwise. This movie also scared the shit out of plenty of people; although, I don't think they fully understood why.<<ref "x">> Clearly, large sections of the movie exist to persuade you (or even manipulate you) into believing he's not evil.<<ref "r">> I suggest this movie was so profitable because it was advertised as and warped into seeming like a "family" film. Appearances can be deceiving. I'm not the only ~~conspiracy theorist~~ woke individual here: there are dozens of us! 

Quick reminder: an agent is psychopathic at least to the degree to which they consistently and purposely turn off their empathy and thus elect to not appropriately factor in [[The Other]] in their reasoning in order to violate [[The Golden Rule]].<<ref "ps">> Very poorly-integrated psychopaths are capable of only the minimal empathy necessary to subsist (and sometimes not even that), often to the point that they fail to empathize with their own [[4DID]]s to extrema.<<ref "p">> Highly-integrated psychopaths (often called sociopaths), either by birth or conditioning, abuse the ability to conveniently turn their empathy on and off like a switch in their heads to violate [[The Golden Rule]] (making them exceptionally effective egoistic manipulators). On these grounds, E.T. is significantly psychopathic and, given his non-trivial planning for the future within the film, a highly-integrated one.

Preliminary E.T. lore is a valuable starting point. The movie was originally slated to be a hostile alien film entitled //Night Skies//.<<ref "n">> That was Spielberg's initial development, and I think pieces of it are leftover in this film. He clearly modified the narrative and tried to soften this alien.<<ref "u">> Public perception has missed the underlying notions and initial vision which are still present in (and not fully revised out of) the final product. Listen to an autist; I know what empathy looks like from the outside. I think it's also serendipitous that the original //Night Skies// main character was autistic, and I doubt "Buddy" was benign. E.T.'s species was intended to be xenomorphic predator mad-scientists in clumsy turd penis costumes. 

It's important to see that E.T. is not stupid. The brainwashing you've received about this film will enable you to rationalize away appearances of malice as ignorance through a biased, confabulatory implementation of Hanlon's razor. Make no mistake: E.T.'s prowess is a shining example of Arthur C. Clarke's third law: 

<<<
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
<<<

Don't let his clumsiness fool you: E.T. is extraordinarily powerful to the point that it's almost magical. Throughout the film, we come to see E.T.'s powers, which include: psychic surgery (the flower), psychokinesis (even large objects like the bike scene), possibly remote viewing but definitely telepathy (Elliott in the classroom), and possibly psychometry or clairsentience (it understands the nature of some technology too quickly).  Are we to believe this creature is magic or abusing physics itself? If by magical fantasy or metaphysics, then E.T. is a demon; if by physics, then E.T. is an evil scientist. 

Furthermore, this creature is a member of an extremely advanced species that travel at or near the speed of light. E.T. can even walk up to alien (for it) technology to MacGyver on-the-fly a device constructed from mostly garbage which can send intergalactic messages back to its homies. Clearly, E.T. is intelligent.

When E.T.'s crew returns to rescue it, it starts getting better. Its proximity through spacetime to its fellow species or its spaceship matters to its health. Its species is going to know that fact. This means that E.T. knows it's going to die if it doesn't get rescued, and that's why it builds the transmitter. Even with the knowledge that it may die, it still goes on to non-consensually bond Elliott's lifeforce to itself: almost killing Elliott in the process. Throughout the film, E.T. bonds, manipulates, and releases Elliott's mind and body at will; it vampirically and parasitically uses Elliott as a disposable tool. Elliott does not consent to E.T.'s psychic and physical connection with it, and E.T. knows that.

This movie is a portrayal of slavery, literal manipulation, and possibly an attempt at premeditated murder. E.T. is puppeteering, mind-raping, and slowly torturing this child to the brink of death. It is also clear that E.T. is capable of developing a non-trivial theory of Elliott's mind. It can interpret, react to, and overtly manipulate Elliott's emotional and cognitive states. E.T. is radically capable of empathy, and it turns off its empathy to attempt a rescue for itself without respecting Elliott's dignity. In other words, E.T. overtly and non-consensually uses Elliott as mere means, subverts Elliott's autonomy, objectifies Elliott as a psychically-controlled limb, callously spends Elliott's life, and elects not to follow [[The Golden Rule]]. Thus, to that extent, E.T. is a psychopath.

Scenes need to be reinterpreted in light of this fact: 

* E.T. is harvesting Earth for plant life, and we are just annoying creatures in the way or play things.
* Elliott is gaslit and experiencing something like Stockholm Syndrome.
* The autonomy of every character must be brought into doubt.
* Elliott is psychically forced to take E.T. to the forest.
* Drunk E.T. causes Elliott to free the frogs and sexually assault a classmate for funsies.
* E.T. enjoys fingering children.

Unexplained:

* Why does E.T. release Elliott before they both die?
* Why don't E.T. and its homies harness their powers far more radically from the beginning?
* If E.T. can heal flowers, why can't it heal itself (homies got too far away maybe)? Why even have Elliott get sick in the first place?
* Why does E.T. appear scared of anyone? He can just force push them away, dissolve their matter, or control their minds.

I suggest many things which are incoherent about the film are a result of Spielberg's failure to de-psychopathologize his horror story into a modern alien-fairy tale. Some folks made a lot of money while fooling the public into normalizing this behavior in our fictional characters.<<ref "d">>

But, wait, there's more. Spielberg spoke of a sequel upon the release of this film, and I think it's because he didn't get to implement his original vision clearly enough.<<ref "a">> The sequel, //E.T. 2: Nocturnal Fears//,<<ref "e">> never saw the light of day because it would ruin this cash cow. It is my contention that the evil, hypnotizing, carnivorous, mutilating, enslaving, child-~~enhanced-interrogating~~-torturing, albino E.T.s of the sequel were much more in line with what Spielberg had in mind all along from the initial concept with //Night Skies//.<<ref "s">>

Thus, at the very least, the onus is on you to show why //E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial// isn't a horror film about a psychopathic alien exploiting children. It seems obvious to me.
