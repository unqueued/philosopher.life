title: 2019.03.11 - Afterschool Teaching: Again

Whitney showed up half an hour early. We talked about her classes. It's interesting to see someone who says she doesn't like school work to become a teacher.

I enjoy giving food to the kids, but I despise the insanity of a billion things going on in the cafeteria. I have a hard time tuning everything down.

Matt came early. He looks exhausted. =/ He took 3 kids, and I took the rest. When I see him speak, I usually only see his mask now. He sent 6CM back to me. He really doesn't like the poor kids. When 7Jm call him bro, he went aggro. Looks like his spoons are spent. Matt has come in to discipline my children for me more than once.

My young rap crew talked about their rap names with me. I told them my rap name would be [[h0p3]]. We talked about why we write.

I was going to the lab, but Delp said the kids have lost their privileges because they didn't stay on the whitelist. He fumbled to lie to me about Matt pressuring him. I've seen him do this with parents too. He asked me to be rougher and more authoritarian with them. "Step on their necks" if you have to. This sucks. I'm willing to do what is morally obligated. Not this one though. The kids will pay the price.

I took them to the gym instead. 

Matt continues to target 5NP. =/ I mean, more than just behavior. 

Delp had a meeting at the end. Sonya gave him a heads up about inspections. He doesn't think there's enough order in general. He wants it to be a prison.
