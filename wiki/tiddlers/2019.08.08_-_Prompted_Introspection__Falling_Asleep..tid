title: 2019.08.08 - Prompted Introspection: Falling Asleep.

!! What do you think about when you can't fall asleep?

It's been over a year since I answered this one: [[2018.04.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Thinking While Falling Asleep]]. This past year has been a partial improvement, but my schedule has been relaxed. If I can't sleep, that's okay. Furthermore, I fall asleep on the couch with great consistency and wake up to head to bed.

My sleeping mask is practically a requirement, and my two pillows are arranged to force a comfortable recovery position. I listen to my cartoons, usually Rick & Morty, and then drift off. It's a habit at this point. A bit of reading before sometimes helps.

If I'm not thinking but just barely seeing, that's when I can usually fall asleep. I have little control over what I'm thinking about when I'm trying not to think so I can fall asleep.
