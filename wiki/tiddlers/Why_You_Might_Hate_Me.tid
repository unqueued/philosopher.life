title: Why You Might Hate Me

//`#AMITHEASSHOLE?` My head is so far up my own ass that I have recursively become my own asshat on an asshat. Who doesn't love their own puns, idioms, and malaphors? I'm an ego wrapped in skin. Yes, I am forced to often seek the salience in the zoo of myself, blindly desensitized to my own odor. My shit stinks, and I am my own brain vomit. Yes, I am salty about the world, but that's what [[The Salience]] does. I'm convinced, given enough time, most people grow to dislike me enough to dis[[love]] me. My honesty, even when articulated kindly, is often socially unacceptable. Everyone believes they are the hero of their own self-authored story. Everyone believes they are right because it's impractical (and sometimes too selfless) to act on the supposition they are not. I do not hope to cast pearls before swine, especially not to the pig inside my human mind. If we must throw stones instead pearls, then so be it. Only wisdom can define wisdom; and I am not wise in the totalitizing dialectic. I [[hope]] not to be a hypocrite. Do you have a charitable beef with me? Are you sure you aren't shooting the messenger? Do you think this is all bullshit (perhaps this fertilizer will be used to cultivate something valuable)? Must we wrestle? Perhaps you are trying to kindly call me out on my bullshit (of which there is plenty!). [[Are you ready to wander the vindicating, excruciating, and invidious rabbithole with this milkshake duck?|Wiki Litmus Test]]//

As long as people are going to call you a lunatic anyway, why not get the benefit of it? It liberates you from convention.
