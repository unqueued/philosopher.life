title: My Depression

Dark Thoughts. Some of them are ideally justified, some of them practically justified, and some of them entirely unjustified.

I'm suffering from existential depression. It's warranted. You probably can't help me directly with it; I don't think anyone else can either. Assuming it actually has a solution is also misguided. There really might not be one. 

Why I'm depressed:

The internal struggled to continually debate between:

[[PTSD]]

[[Positive Disintegration]]

[[My Fundamental Internal Conflict]]


 [[Who Am I?]] and [[Who I Am?]]

[[Freedom]]

[[The Red Pill]]

[[The End of Humanity]]

[[The "Whine like a Baby" Section]]

[[Why Are People Stupid?]]

[[Practical life]]

[[My Cynicism]]

[[Your Parenting]]
