title: 2018.06.08 - Wiki Audit Log: Voting

I worked my buns off on [[The Original Position]] and voting today. It's congealing into something I like. It's better than what I had. I still need to pour a couple more days of work into it. I'm on the cusp of having the initial draft of a strong point of view. I'd like to have that in my pocket, to have a draft to revise and develop (perhaps evolve into something radically different). 

I have to tell you, I'm super happy to feel energized about something, to feel like I'm working on something that actually matters to our lives. How often do I get to do that?
