title: 2019.07.02 - Prompted Introspection: Yuss, Fav Holiday, Best Question Ever

!! What is your favorite holiday? Why?

Yuss, in less than a month I have to answer this again: [[2019.06.10 - Prompted Introspection: Holiday Question, Again.]]. I'm such an eruditard of unimpeachable moral integrity for answering these questions. Okay, since then, I've completely changed my gaslitic schizo mind. I'm trying not to be reductive, stereotyping, inauthentic, unoriginal, elitist, overtroped, or dabitudinous about it.

Since it is coming up, my new favorite holiday in my flitting butterfly life is the 4th of July. You see, I think the United States is the best nation to have ever existed. We are ordained by God, and our leaders and businessmen are men of honor chosen by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to be in charge.<<ref "c">> I respect them as persons and their office; and, I hope one day to be worthy enough to lick the shit off their boots. Also, I would like to shout out to our vets (upvote, crosspost across your social media, spread my forced #TAG maymay, and share dis if u as virtuous as I am in zealous nationalism [make sure to give me credit too]): thank you so much for your profound service. I just wouldn't be me without you all, and I wouldn't have all the freedoms I have without your sacrifices either. You know, it's a good thing for the savages and poors around the world (especially those illegals in my nation) that they obey us, and it's their fault that we have to go to war with them in everything. Never forgetti, if you are poor or (((one of them))), you deserve it; if you are mentally ill or addicted, then you are garbage; lift yourself up by your own bootstraps in capitalism; and, reading is for pussies. Basically, when I say I own myself as a person, I mean I don't owe you anything unless it makes me feel good or is the kind of personal identity or disposition my brand of confabulated morally relativized desires makes it convenient for me to pursue. Intellectuals scare me, and my amygdala can't handle the possibility I'm wrong deep down about anything in the world; John Locke was the OG American, and I think [[Ayn Rand]]'s only fault is that she was a woman who didn't respect my religion enough. Also, reality makes me sad so I try not to think about it, and I'm not really responsible for anything I do in my life. Oh, fireworks, shiny! Guys, I'm having such a good time; this is living a life of merit.

I am grateful to the tiny percentage of altruistic radical Leftists who live in this world. You are my only hope, Obi-wan. Have the shirt off my back, my drugs, my ears, muh calculators, and my moaning bussy.

<<footnotes "c" "Conversely, I'm like so above that standard blue/red tribalism because I'm a privileged, apathetic, crypto-tradcon Democratic pseudo-enlightened-centrist reactionary who believes neoliberal or demsoc safety net policies under the guise of pluralism are the only possible moral options. No, no, see: there's so much more nuance to my point of view, and these are the only possibilities in the world: you just need to learn2econ or be more humble otherwise. My liberal-guilt-itis requires me to carefully curate my media experiences so as not to accidentally empathize with the plight of billions of people in the world, and I need to lie to myself in just the right way so that I can feel morally superior or sufficient without actually sacrificing my time and energy for others (bonus point: other people buy these lies and play a language game with me which validates the narrative and personality I'm shaping). Look, it's not really my fault, and it can't be. Guis, there's definitely a way to justify the overall basic structures of society which enable the wealth, income, and consumption of someone in my brackets, and there's no possibility I could ever be a bad person (I'm like, totally in favor of idpol and restricting freespeech, plus I recycle, people like me, and I shop at Wholefoods; you just need to learn how to be more civil in discourse...also, it's so gross that you would ever call someone evil. That's like, evil.). To be clear, I'm totally in favor of socialism as an idea even though I don't really know it means and I have no intention of really wrestling to understand or implement such a thing (it just looks good and makes me good that I say I support it). Oh, wait, I know what I really am: I'm an atheist anarcho-capitalist egoistic follower of the Rand-Locke Memeplex who wholly embraces our corporate overlords that make America so great for me.">>
