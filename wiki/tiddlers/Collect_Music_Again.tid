title: Collect Music Again

Collect, catalog, organize, and listen to music you care about. Even if relativism is true, it is prudent to activate the parts of your brain which care about //what// music you are listening to. Care about your aural experiences. Don't rely upon Pandora. That's lazy. That's not what curation should be. Do not put yourself in that bubble. Escape it! You've gotta earn it.
