** Definitely happy. He got to play with his friends a lot this week.
*** That's because he finished his school work more often.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** You did a great job focusing on your work this week.
** You've been more willing to do projects this week, like working on Minecraft and stuff. You've been patient working out the problems. 
** You've done a good job not melting down this week. You kept your composure, even when you were upset. 
* j3d1h
** You were honest with yourself this week. You had the integrity to say what you did right and what you did wrong. 
** You were really kind, and you avoided getting into fights. 
** You did a good job running your wire. The measurement was good. You ran it nicely, and you mounted it nicely.
* k0sh3k
** You have been lighter on us. 
** You have very good ideas, and you are good at sticking to the plans you formulate around the ideas.
** After reading your wiki, I realized that you could have passed the buck, and you didn't. You took the initiative and responsibility for a difficult social problem which I wouldn't have had the gumption or willpower to fix. I think you were a good manager and people problem solver, and the world desperately needs those.
* h0p3
** I've been kinder to my chilluns.
** I appreciate that you focus on the details, like your wiki's favicon.
** You've been focusing on positive things in your wiki, and it shows. Also, thank you for my presents.
