title: 2019.09.05 - Prompted Introspection: State of Mind

!! What is your current state of mind?

Blurry, disappointed in my choices not to read and write more, surprisingly okay with the state of [[m16]], falling behind in my responsibilities, trying to catchup in the whirlwind with my offspring and public children, feeling quite guilty about not having completed a response to [[DeathOfRobinhood]], feeling worried about my brothers, losing my mind about the state of the affairs as nightmares unfold, drugging myself out of reality like a hypocrite, but enjoying life (I can't say I have a right to do so). I'm confused, and I think I'm not being reflective enough.
