Hey, how goes it?
TUE 11:28 AM
Thought  you might laugh: https://philosopher.life/#2019.02.24%20-%20TLDR%3A%20A%20Car%20Ride
TUE 11:29 AM
I did.
TUE 11:29 AM
She called you a pussy? Lol
TUE 12:15 PM
Lol
TUE 12:15 PM
Yeah.
TUE 12:15 PM
It was hilarious. It was a gothic, sarcastic, smiling moment.
TUE 12:15 PM
Lol
TUE 12:16 PM
Not sure i understand how  she jumped from "sanity requires you to accept the illogical" to "your a pussy for doing something insane"
TUE 12:17 PM
She was calling me a pussy for not pursuing certainty.
TUE 12:19 PM
How's your day going?
TUE 12:22 PM
Cut my hand and smashed my pinky, otherwise okay :sunglasses:
TUE 12:22 PM
Pix!
TUE 12:23 PM
I'm sorry about your hand.
TUE 12:23 PM
How'd that go?
TUE 12:23 PM
Tiny cut, wasnt wearing glove and did something stupid.  Pipe was stuck on something so i jerked it backwards, caught my pinky between the end of the pipe and a gangbox.  Pinky hurt like a mofo
TUE 12:25 PM
=(
TUE 12:25 PM
I bet.
TUE 12:25 PM
I think fingers have more nerve endings in them.
TUE 12:26 PM
I finally got the miter bar tight in the table saw after my new taps arrived.  Then found out there is additional play in the handle, not sure how to make it any tighter
TUE 12:27 PM
Gonna go see K and L sunday, looking forward to it.
TUE 12:27 PM
Mom sent email after we drove down there, asking if im still on meds and if im ok
TUE 12:28 PM
Guess im not giving off great vibes
TUE 12:28 PM
Ever wish you were someone else?
TUE 12:29 PM
(I would like to see pics of the miter bar.)
TUE 12:30 PM
That is a fascinating claim.
TUE 12:30 PM
Yes, all the time.
TUE 12:30 PM
I have been worried about you since our last phone conversation. Sometimes felt off.
TUE 12:30 PM
something*
TUE 12:30 PM
Who do you wish you were?
TUE 12:31 PM
(it's awesome that you get to see L and K this Sunday)
TUE 12:32 PM
I had a crazy dream last night.  I was at college heights, lots of people in medieval garb.  Suddenly we all sprang into crazy gallops, weaving between one another, tearing each other to pieces with razor sharp claws.  I was one step ahead of everyone, eviscerating any in my path, constantly evading my pursuers. I ran down the dark hallway to the sunday schools rooms... and woke myself up by the sound of my own heavy snoring (breathing as if I had actually been running)
TUE 12:36 PM
I wish I was that dream version of me...
TUE 12:36 PM
Jk
TUE 12:36 PM
Rofl!
TUE 12:37 PM
I guess I really just want to be someone that doesn't want to be someone else (might as well ask what is virtuous...)
TUE 12:37 PM
You want to be someone who wants to be themselves.
TUE 12:38 PM
I will argue that even virtuous agents will find  themselves in contexts in which they wish they weren't there.
TUE 12:38 PM
I meant that virtue ethics becomes tautological sometimes-- the virtuous thing to do is what a virtuous agent would do in that situation)
TUE 12:40 PM
Similarly, Im not giving a great description of what kind of person i wish i were
TUE 12:40 PM
That is true.
TUE 12:40 PM
The virtuous agent can both want not to suffer, but also override that desire and ultimately want to do it because they find it virtuous. There are some virtue theorists who deny it (Hursthouse will call them "marred"). Your point is excellent.
TUE 12:41 PM
I can't give an apt description for myself even.
TUE 12:42 PM

My brother was feeling down, but he seemed better today. I wonder how the anti-depressants and the THC are mixing for him. I should have asked him what he thought about it.

My brother had some insanely violent dreams. He also had a lucid dream where he knew he was lucid dreaming. I'm envious. Mine was post-facto recognition. I thought I was up just thinking to myself with my eyes shut (which is what I like to do anyway), and I didn't realize I was dreaming.

Rebecca is despairing without a child. =( I think they are growing convinced again that not having a marriage certificate is held against them. That sucks because they are wildly saner than most people I know.

They didn't have a good time at my donors, but it wasn't bad. They did get to see [[AG]], which was cool. 

I can tell my brother doesn't look at my wiki much. That's so weird to me. I'm always looking for anything from him. He did read the link I sent him about my daughter calling me a //pussy//. He said he didn't get why, but he thought it was funny. 

His work is okayish. They are making everyone jump through some foolish hoops from the sounds of it. Eh. It's work. Hotdog sounds hilarious. Weird to see vidyas like that but he's never even heard of 4chan. Kids these days...<<ref "a">>

<<footnotes "a" "Why is it that my wife and I seem to connect more effectively with people about a decade younger than we are? What the hell does that even mean? Are we incompetent or something? Whatever. I want to talk to people that make sense or are willing to try to 
make sense (which makes sense to me).">>
