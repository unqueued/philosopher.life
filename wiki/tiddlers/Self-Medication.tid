title: Self-Medication

I have seen several doctors, only two of which understood that I have mental health problems and gave me any help. I have tried SSRI's and anti-anxiety prescription medicines. They did not work.<<ref "1">> Although, I've been reading a lot of books by psychologists and researching online, I have not paid to see a professional psychologist. 

I don't fully trust psychiatry or psychology (as science moreso, but as industries far less so), and I tend to extend even less trust to what I will brand as "counseling folklore" in most cases. Relatedly, I can't afford to see a qualified psychiatrist/psychologist.

Anyone who has seen the history of how "crazy" people (many of whom weren't crazy) have been treated by psychologists would at least be very cautious. The history of mistreatment and mistreating is legion. Beyond the history of abuses of power in the psychology industry, from a scientific perspective, the human mind is not nearly as understood as many other physical objects and phenomena in the world. This doesn't mean psychology is useless or not to be trusted //tout court//. Far from it. 

It is obvious that psychiatrists, psychologists, and even counselors help many, many people. They don't help all people though, and I do not have excellent evidence that they can or would help me. They have made the lives of many people much worse as well. Overall, I believe psychology is a force for good in the world though.

We are making progress in understanding the human mind. I'm convinced that cognitive science, neuroscience, phil. of psych., and other scientifically oriented psychological studies are making most of the progress. That said, I think folklore-psychology sometimes provides important hypotheses and anecdotes that are ripe for scientific study; it is obvious they can be onto something important about human nature, even though they can't quantify it or provide fitting conceptual analysis. In any case, the more we understand our brains as computers in a biosack we call human bodies, the closer we get to unraveling the mystery of human psychology. We might say that the fields of computing and psychology are rapidly closing in on and overlapping each other. Psychology is a specific kind of computer science,<<ref "2">> and human psychology is a kind of medical psychology.

While science progresses, that doesn't mean it is sufficient. More problematically, I think the medical industry in my nation is a machine used to extract capital from the working class. I've known a lot of med and psych students. They are not brilliant people (no offense), and the vast majority are there to make money (the administrative, middle-man, bureaucracy of capitalists above them are even more psychopathic in my experience). It is not a vocation for them. Ironically, the least qualified (counselors) are the ones who take it to be their vocation. It is obvious that we either cannot trust their motives or their credentials. We cannot trust the architecture of the industry.<<ref "3">> I think the pharmaceutical industry (and our twisted intellectual property regime) only further hamstrings the possibility of having access to the right tools.

Crucially, I do not trust others to help me at this level because no one has actually succeeded in guiding or healing my life in this respect. Why would I leave this up to anyone else? Why would I willingly give up my freedom to someone who doesn't know me as well as I know myself? Why would I think they can solve or give me the tools to solve the conflict in my reality map? All the evidence points to the fact that they can't actually help me. Call it paranoia if you want. Call it being a control freak. Call it unwise. //Oh Virtuous One, you have not been in my shoes. //I'm mentally unstable, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

Someone who understands what I understand should feel the way that I feel; I think it is only rational. People are too //certain// that life is worth living. They have shallow reality maps. Evolutionary memetic denial of the dark areas of existentialism, morality, and epistemology leads to a mass delusion in our population that enables most humans to survive longer based upon unjustified assumptions. Just because you feel life is worth living doesn't mean you are right. If I had access to affordable doctor that really understood that crucial fact and also had the necessary credentials to deal with a freak like me, I'd go to them.

I think someone who fully understood the problem I see in my reality map would want to kill themselves too. Fortunately for you, you can't just be handed my intuitions. You have to cultivate them (and no offense, you probably aren't weird enough to do it). No amount of behavioral therapy is going to fix my existential rift (although it may help me generate the space to do it). I am the only who who can fix the real problem. That doesn't mean I don't need support, but the problem is ultimately mine to deal with.

I run a very high risk of not finding a qualified psychologist. Vanishingly few have the practical experience and toolset to help gifted, autistic, existentially depressed people correctly. If I get an unqualified psychologist, they really could steer in me drastically wrong ways. It isn't just that they might not fix the problem, but they really can make it worse (far worse when you consider their physical power over you). I've not found any in my area (a somewhat rural region) that come even close to what I need. Even if there were qualified psychologists in my area, I don't have the money to afford it. 

You might think "getting some help is better than no help." That is obviously not true. This isn't like hiring a part-time maid to help clean your house. The maid might not clean everything, but they at least help get your house in the right direction. Treating your mind isn't like that. The analogy is about as foolish as trying to compare your house's financial principles to a nation's monetary policy.

Anyways, I don't have the resources to get the help I need. More importantly, my family needs me right now, broken or not. 

So, I have to be my own health advocate; I have to make my own diagnoses. It's the only practical option available to me. Throw out my opinion right here if you need to. I totally understand that I'm not an expert, that I'm not a doctor, and that I'm not qualified to answer these questions for my self in a medical sense.<<ref "4">> I think you will have a hard time showing me why I shouldn't do this though.

I realize I'm in a high-stakes learning, existential crisis resolution, and behavior modification process. In being both the undereducated operator and mentally unstable operatee, I'm in trouble. There is a non-trivial chance I will fail to heal myself. I have to have hope that I can fix this though. It's really my only option. It's theoretically and practically the best thing I can do. 

Frankly, I'm proud of the job I've done so far. If you could step into my shoes, I think you would think so too. It isn't perfect, but I am making progress. I regularly have my wife and children give me assessments. I keep records. I try to give a data-driven approach to handling my own treatment. I'm engaging in the science of making myself (and my family) happy, even though I am a very shitty scientist. On top of that, this wiki is a tool for the philosophical and possibly for social problems I'm experiencing. I've been increasingly motivated to solve the problem, and I've been working hard on it. It may be a sign that I'm emerging from from my problem (/fingers-crossed), and that I'm being successful in my self-treatment. I could be wrong. I cannot give up. My children need me.

Here's my self-diagnosis:

* I am extremely confident that I am [[depressed|My Depression]], specifically suffering from existential depression.
* I am extremely confident that I suffer from an [[anxiety disorder|Anxiety]], which previously included panic attacks.
* I am fairly confident that I am suffering from [[autism|Autism]] (despite some positive effects).
* I am fairly confident that I am suffering from [[being extremely intelligent]].<<ref "5">>
* I am not confident, but feel justified in believing I am suffering from [[PTSD]]
* I am not confident, but feel justified in believing I am experiencing [[positive disintegration|Positive Disintegration]].
* I am not confident, but feel justified in believing I am psychologically dependent upon, but not suffering from addiction to two substances: [[Cannabis]] and [[Deschloroketamine]].
**That is to say, these are acting as medicines rather than as abused drugs in my life. They improve my functionality and allow me to make progress on the causes of my pain. They are a net positive force in my life. While there are definitely negative consequences to using any mind altering substance (prescribed medicine included), the positive consequences far outweigh the negative. 
***Ask my immediate family. They can see the difference.
***See the thinking and work that has gone into this wiki. Parts of it would not be possible without cannabis. 
**Cannabis use ranges up to .5ml of [[Cannabutter|Cannabutter Recipe]], or 30mg (60mg/ml) of cannabis plant, or 3-6mg THC and 0.3-0.9mg CBD for 6 days a week on a [2 months on, 2 weeks off] rotation.
*** ~10-20% THC and 0.1-.3% CBD is a fairly standard range. Obviously, this can vary with your strain, batch, and how you cook. Unfortunately, I did not have my batch tested (at the time, there weren't any good ways available to me).
*** 10mg of THC (not plant, but THC) is the commonly recommended dose for experienced edible users. 
**** I have tried high doses. Unless I'm with friends/family (which is rare), it isn't fun for me. I don't find being that high very appealing. 
**** I dose well below the recommended range. I'm not quite microdosing, but I'm trying to find the right average amount. My goal is only to use what I need. I want sanity and productivity. 
***Cannabis temporarily helps me with my anxiety and depression.
**** Overall, it greatly increases my functionality. It is worlds more effective than the prescription meds I took. 
**** In particular, while using this medicine, I find that I have the emotional energy to deal with the causes of my anxiety. 
*** I am very wary of cannibinoid tolerance.
****My two week abstinences eliminate my tolerance buildup.
*** My break every two months allows me to make sure I'm not physically dependent.
*** My break every two months allows me to see what life is like without cannabis.
**** I hope to eventually just stop during a rotation, to see my life is better without it.
*** The overall cost per daily use is ~$1.58 (cost per hour of effect is fairly efficient).
**Deschloroketamine use is 20mg every Sunday. 
*** Deschloroketamine (DCK) helps my depression (it's a miracle!), but doesn't seem to affect my anxiety much. After DCK, I at least have hope during my anxiety though, and that is tremendous.
***Very little is known about this particular substance. I'm forced to rely heavily upon the standard drug-user sites, such as:
****http://www.bluelight.org/
****https://psychonautwiki.org/
****https://www.erowid.org/
****https://tripsit.me/
****https://clinicaltrials.gov/
****https://reddit.com/
***Ketamine is an unpatentable (because it has been around for so long) dissociative used to treat burn victims and people suffering treatment-resistant depression (legal treatments cost $700 a week).
****It's hard to get clinical trials for a substance that no one can make money from. It doesn't matter how effective it is (70% success rate against treatment resistant depression) to those in power. Pharma exists to extract capital from you. They don't want a cure, and it is obvious they do not want to compete with this medicine.
***I can't afford ketamine, and deschloroketamine is a highly similar analog. It tends to have lower "high" effects than regular ketamine (or MXE, or many other diss. RCs), but it has a long duration (4-6 hours, with up to a 12 hour afterglow, and it generally suppresses my depression for 1-3 days) for extremely low doses (which is excellent for tolerance and a couple other health factors). 
***20mg deschloroketamine is considered to be roughly equivalent to 50mg of ketamine. 50mg ketamine through IV is fairly standard for treatment. I use enteral administration since I needed to dissolve it in propylene glycol for volumetric dosing.
***I did not and do not take this substance lightly. I am quite aware of the dangers of dissociatives, and I am without a doubt at risk. However, this shit works. It's a miracle.
*** The overall cost per weekly use is ~$2.65  (considering the afterglow and following days, the cost per hour of effect is absurdly efficient). 
* I am not confident, but feel justified in believing I am not psychologically dependent upon [[Alcohol]].
**I have binge drunk many times in the past 10 years.
*** Sometimes, drinking has been the only numbing agent that allowed me to survive the night. I did need it those nights.
*** I drink way less this year than the year before, and hopefully I can continue that trend.
**I consider alcohol to be the most dangerous substance I use. My goal is to eliminate it entirely.
*** Deschloroketamine entirely removes any thoughts of alcohol from my mind. On Sundays I find even the thought of alcohol disturbing. 
* I am not confident, but feel justified in believing I no longer must experiment with substances (since I believe I found the two I need to fix my problem). 
** The last new substance I tried was in January 2016 (Deschloroketamine). 
** In the past 4 years I've experimented with kava extract, kratom, nutmeg extract, morning glory seed extract, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD (which was most likely 1P-LSD), methamnetamine, and a handful of nootropics (like caffeine). 
***Methamnetamine (MNA) is NOT methamphetamine. MNA is much closer to MDMA. 
* I am not confident, but feel justified in believing I am not physiologically dependent upon any substances. 
**I monitor usage patterns in my records and have controlled administration of my substances (with harm reduction practices).

But seriously, I am convinced that I have long been closer to the upper limits of the human IQ bell curve than the average (at least before this crisis, including alcohol and cannabis use).">>
