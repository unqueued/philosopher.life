title: The Solitude of Prime Numbers

I adore prime numbers. I've been interested in prime number theory since I was a kid. Great analogy for me. I suggest I'm not well-read or intelligent enough to appreciate important aspects of this book (and that's okay!).

[[Sphygmus]]'s bookchoice is powerful. I am hesitant to ask this question, and I need to first answer it about myself publicly before asking (indeed, this is so fucking crazy personal that I haven't earned the right to ask it): does [[Sphygmus]] harm herself? Self-harm comes in many varieties. Part of the issue here is that I'm having a hard time understanding why anyone wouldn't immediately love [[Sphygmus]]. I'm not saying she's perfect, and I don't mean to hold her up on a pedestal.

!! //Alright, [[h0p3]], how do you self-harm?//

* Binge-drinking, over-eating...hell, experience machines and augmentation. [[Cypher's Choice]] here I come.
* Psychosis generated and generating self-criticism.
* Not planning ahead.
* Not taking myself seriously [[irwartfrr]].
* Not getting enough sleep.
* A complete lack of aerobic exercise.
* Failing to build relationships [[irwartfrr]] (though indirect, I suppose).

You know, I am most ashamed of how I harm [[others]]. The shame of being a shitty father especially makes me not want to live (though, ironically, that is being an even shittier father, and yes, that recurs).

I hope to [[FTO]] in myself? Sign away and transcend, sir.

Her father sounds like an asshole (ofc, I sound like an asshole too).

Visceral and brief.

The older I get, the riskier my ~~farts~~ possible sharts become. Humiliation is a powerful force in our eyes. Often, it is not due.

It's interesting to see what someone is thinking about when they assume they are dying.

The difference between the siblings is stark. I am reminded of my son in some respects, and I feel like we have been so lucky to come as far as we have.

Heartbreaking scene (with foreshadowing); this is the stuff of my nightmares.

Stigmata.

The bully scene is infuriating.

Tons of sexual content here. Coming of age story is strong. I remember aspects of it.

Rachel is a girl that we took in (my age) when I was 15ish? She had eating disorders, was a cutter, and engage in self-harm quite a bit. This is brings me back.

Name drop is what I expect. I'd like to know if the oft quote passage is something the author wrote before the rest of the story.

The jump to university is abrupt. The pursuit of certainty in mathematics is clear. Apodicticity is comforting.

I certainly faced interpersonal problems in graduate school, but I don't think I had this kind of trouble. Philosophy must just be different than other disciplines/departments.

Interesting to see the lack of interest in graduation. Been there, done that.

The adult relationship is tough. I am reminded of //Hills Like White Elephants// talking past each other.

This book reminds me how I still felt like a kid in my 20's (less so in my 30's). Frontal lobes, yeah, yeah.

This book is sad (surprise!).
