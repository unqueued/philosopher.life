title: 2019.02.07 - Computer Musings: Git Performance

Git has ~~twice~~ thrice ballooned up to 4.5GB of memory (slowly accumulating with no end in sight after the initial burst). Working to find out why. Minutely to two? Is this a race? Killing Wiki-Everything git. Troubleshooting by stripping it down. So far, I think killing the Everything is just fine. I suppose it is a failed experiment. Cool. You win some, you lose some. This is anecdata, not science.
