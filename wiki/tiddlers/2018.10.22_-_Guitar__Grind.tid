title: 2018.10.22 - Guitar: Grind

My son and I played Minuet in G. We worked on the second page. It's sounding pretty good. There are sections here where the chording is actually more difficult than the fingerpicking. I'm trying to show him how to relax the requirements of the music without losing much. 

My daughter continued to grind her on her piece.

Got drunk. Kids and I spent hours until midnight listening and talking about the music collection my son is building. Walked through it. Powerful experience to me. It's a damned good day when you get to spend hours with your chillun just thinking about music. I don't know much about it in too many respects, but I know we're talking about [[The Beautiful]], /bow.
