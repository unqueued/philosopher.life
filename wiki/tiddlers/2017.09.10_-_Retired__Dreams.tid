All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.

-- T.E. Lawrence

I need to dream. I need to hope. In a sense, to some degree, dreaming is what my name means.<<ref "1">> 

I have a section devoted to who I was. I have many sections devoted to who I am. I need to have sections devoted to who I will be.<<ref "2">> I need a place where I get to be joyful. I need a place that can be practical or impractical. It doesn't matter. I'm just dreaming here. Some of it may come about, and some may not. I'll enjoy the feeling, the possibility, or even the remote experience.

I dreamt a lot about video games, about how to improve my character, about progress and possibilities. I need to do that for my life!
