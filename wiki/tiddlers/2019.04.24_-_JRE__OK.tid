So, obviously we both have personalities, and they have to comprised of something. I think that we both love //The Office// and weed while also enjoying making fun of crossfit is part of who we are. But, even the sum total of these desires doesn't seem sufficient (or if it does, why can't we call the person who centers their life around weed or being LGBQT?). Personality, as a value, has to been compared to some external standard.

My brother made laugh a bunch tonight. We talked about the "OK" masturbation hold, he goes for the "Tea for Strumpets" tweezer rapid-glide, and mine is the full-handed economy of motion. It's a good thing our dicks are tiny. Pocket pussies have made our hands obsolete.

We talked about farting and shitting for a good while, especially regarding our betters halves. Life is good. Also, my brother's fake puke sound is outstanding. I need it for notifications on my phone.

I talked to him about my job. He's offered to help 5CM.

He wrote a letter to an old friend. He felt it was TMI, or at least too much up front in the oscillation of reconnecting. It was a thankyou letter. I hope my brother keeps connecting with people and spilling his guts with them. I wish he had a dozen friends who were as good to him as he is to me.

His description of restless leg syndrome sounds almost terrifying to me. I hope his new meds will help.
