title: The Ring of h0p3

As far as I am concerned, the Golden Rule (the CI itself) is //the// classic thought experiment in metaethics. Right behind it, the Ring of Gyges is the next most important thought experiment in metaethics because it shows us what perfection itself is like in practice. It was meant to describe Justice, but I think it describes normativity in general with the simplicity and beauty of no other device (the Veil of Ignorance emerged as a distributed Ring of Gyges, but it still rests upon that atomic notion). The Ring of Gyges speaks to the concept of Moral Virtue, Virtue of the Moral Practice directly. The Golden Rule is only more beautiful because it is the contents of morality, even if it applies Utility. The Ring of Gyges is an ancient tale from the genius of geniuses of geniuses himself, Plato:<<ref "1">>

Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a god among men.

Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust.

For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.<<ref "2">>

Tolkien obviously came when he read this, all over his book. Unfortunately, even Plato was wrong about The Ring of Gyges. Socrates claims justice can't be reduced to this notion since the unjust man is enslaved to his appetites, and thus not rational and free, and therefore not an agent, and therefore he isn't happy.<<ref "3">> Yeah. That argument sucks. The Ring of Gyges is a false device because "it doesn't make us happy." Wrong. That argument cannot be why it is conceptually flawed. Not being an agent means we can't be happy? Wrong. Eudaimonia is achievable, whether we are free or not. Rationality can make us happier (it doesn't always; we have to wield the instrument virtuously); we just have to try really hard. Of course, we are slaves to our appetites. It's the redpilled truth. We aren't free like we thought we were. And it doesn't matter, my nihilist friend. 

We aren't moral agents; there are no objective moral truths. Yes, the transcendental still exists, but normativity in itself, the Greatest of all things in itself, The Good, etc. can never be touched or fully seen. As mortals in this realm, it cannot be real for us. We will only ever see shadows. We must be content with the shadows on the wall. There is a place where we cannot be philosophers because, in a way, it just doesn't and cannot exist for us, with us, in us, or because of us. Perhaps it is faith. Perhaps it is our plight. Perhaps it is axiomatic to us and constitutive of the appearance of unified agency. 

The stoic must accept the inability to see into the [[Transcendental Gateway]]. It's okay, it's not your fault. It's not up to you, and in a way, nothing really is. That's okay though. Enjoy the epiphenomenal experience of freedom and consciousness. Why not? It's not like you can do anything about it anyways. This is your chance to take that spark of h0p3 and do something with it. Make life meaningful for yourself. There is no authority on meaning outside of yourself (and you know that you aren't really an authority either, but so what? Who has the authority to say you shouldn't? No one. Exactly). 

The nihilist is the ultimate wielder of The Ring of Gyges. Allow me to profane the sacredness of the highest saints and gods among men before me and call that phenomenon: The Ring of h0p3. The "just" wielder of the Ring of h0p3 is the positive nihilistic state of being moral because you want to be moral without feeling it to be a burden. To be clear, you define morality for yourself. That doesn't mean you'll always find yourself to be perfect or justified (that would be a confabulation we couldn't accept). It's okay that you don't like who you are sometimes, and it's okay that you strive to be better. Who makes the rules? Well. You do. Of course, if it is too unbearable, just remember: it doesn't matter anyways, but don't dwell there too long. You really do want stuff to matter. Remember:

Program yourself.

It's your plight to desire The Good. Go for it. Be wise about it. Be practical and ideal. Do your best. Forgive yourself when you don't. You probably can't program yourself out of that, and you probably wouldn't want to. That isn't the kind of life you want to lead, and you don't need to worry about someone else approving of your moral theory. Do it because you approve of it. That doesn't mean don't listen to people, but it means that you need to be the ultimate law giver for yourself. It's the only Good thing to do. And thus, Right and Good were collapsed. There is only normativity: your normativity. 

They may call it relativism. You used to. You still might. Does it matter? No, not really. Nihilist! Lol. For whatever it's worth (which is ultimately nothing, ha), 

The person who is wearing the Ring of h0p3 is the ultimate wielder of The Ring of Gyges because they not only knew they could get away with anything, because nothing actually matters, because they aren't moral realists, and yet they still try to act as the person whose actions are no different with or without the Ring of Gyges. The Ring of Gyges burns brightly on the nihilist. It transforms into its true form: the Ring of h0p3. It is one thing to not be immoral even when there are no consequences, but it is entirely more profound to not be immoral when there are no objective reasons not to do so. 

There are nihilists who wear the Ring of h0p3 and feel it is a heavy burden to them, as though our plight should not be celebrated or enjoyed. Their existence is a challenge without the love of challenge. They seem to lack hope in the face of being a moral-realist-ish nihilist. Be the nihilist who loves wearing the Ring of h0p3. Have hope with that ring. Find a life worth living, that you enjoy, that is meaningful, that is the best you can do with it. Be a [[eudaimonic lifehacker]].

Unfortunately, the successful wielder of the Ring of h0p3, the eudaimonic lifehacker, must be on the road to eudaimonia. You have to let your skepticism go. It's the only way to get happy. Be a skeptic about humans, but don't be a skeptic about the transcendent or your reasons for getting up in the morning. Plato, hilariously, is right about the problem of happiness and its connection to the ring. He just didn't account for moral luck. Some of us can only be so happy. It's luck of the draw what life we get. Let's make the best of it. We cannot assume that everyone has a chance of successfully wielding the Ring of h0p3. We aren't free agents by definition. You've got to hope you are part of the lucky few who have the chance to be a eudaimonic lifehacker.<<ref "5">>
