title: 2019.06.08 - TDL: Lentils

* Family Time!
** I hope it goes better this time.
* You've not been reading books. You should. =)
* The carpet needs mowing, especially since the cats go outside so much.
* Perhaps finish those leftovers of lentil soup. You should make sure they aren't wasted.
* Keep trying to connect with your brother.
* Finish //Good Omens// with your wife.
