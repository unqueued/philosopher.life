I've switched to AoKL and +2 Necro prismatic necro shield. I've dropped down to 220mf, and I'm lacking the 35% DR, block rate, and defense I had before. In trade, I pick up 12 minions and +7 Mastery. That's a lot of damage.

Also, I tried, Boneshade Wand with 20 BS + 7ish Golem Mastery with Insight runeword Iron Golem. It's very unobvious that the damage is worth it. It's a more complicated playstyle, spammy. I think maxing out on Skeleton Mastery is just clearly better.
