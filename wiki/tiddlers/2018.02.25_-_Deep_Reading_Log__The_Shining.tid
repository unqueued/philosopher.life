title: 2018.02.25 - Deep Reading Log: The Shining

My wife asked me about whether or not I had seen the bathroom scene. I said I did, but I thought she was talking about the wasps. Then she talked about the mirror and red rum, looking at me like I was an idiot for not seeing that it talked about murder. Apparently, that scene happens later in the book. And, King flatly tells you it says Murder! I would have gotten it, but only because he slaps you in the face with it.

I can't tell how much King aims for symbolism. The boiler is no joke, but does it mean something more?

King is clearly an alcoholic. He writes about it so strongly.

The telepathy hack to understand a character's stream of consciousness is not abused to the point of me hating it.

One striking thing about the way in which the will of the persons of these stories are supernaturally controlled is that, well...you can kind of see how this would happen (at least some of the ugly parts) without having had a supernatural cause in the first place.
