title: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Alright, so if you are an accomplished occlumens, why not just kill "The Dark Lord" when he's got his back turned? We know he can make the kill. This is ridiculous. God, I hate to have the redemption of Snape ruined even one iota.

I have to compare my 2.314" wand with Voldemort's footlong pringles can horsecock of a wand. I am surprised that truth detection isn't more revelatory and powerful. The power over minds is not well-used in this series.

Also, I fucking love duels!

Cloak and dagger against ~~the ministry~~ Voldemort is outstanding. Unfortunately, this shit feels pretty real these days.

Sadly, the escape feels so forced. =(

Why can't the whole order do it again? Wait, why does it have to be Harry?

I remember reading a first draft of this book before it was published. It was far more adult; there is a literal sex scene at the end. This series needed way more boning in it.

Love Hermione so much. #rekin' 

Why the fuck does he not take Lupin's help? Clearly, he needs it.

Umbridge the Nazi is back. Love to hate her. Dementor SS. As usual, I love the reverse "witch" hunt, lol. What I like about the focus on magic is that it's clearly a focus on power!

I think the names of the spells could have been done in a way that wasn't silly. =(

Gotta admit, the Ron leaving scene feels completely forced. The comeback is fine. This reminds me of the opposite of the mirror from book 1.

I wish we understood more about the Horcrux and Voldemort's experiences (even in the destruction of these devices).

If a Ron were beating on Hermione, this would have been unacceptable. Fuck that sexism.

Love the name Jynx. That shit is 1984 all over.

Posthoc reasoning about Dumbledore and Hallows makes no sense.

OOO notion in how we deal with other species.

Why don't they just explain to Griphook that he can have the sword AFTER they destroy Voldemort? Seems pretty obvious to me.

Fascinating to see The Imperius curse wielded by those who otherwise would not. The moral/legal distinction is bright.

Dumbledore is [[fff]].

This book has way too much corn in it.

I do not understand Snape's escape or reasoning.

No, I fear I have been wrong about Snape's redemption. This was poorly planned. The story doesn't make sense at all, but it is still moving. The memory scene makes no sense. Actually, the end of the book doesn't at all. =(

How Dumbledore "knew" this shit would happen is irrational. He couldn't even reason about the ring correctly.

The end duel sucks. =(

Letting go of the elder wand is stupid. Lots of corn at the end.

This series was not as good as I remembered. Nostalgia corrected is a bitch.
