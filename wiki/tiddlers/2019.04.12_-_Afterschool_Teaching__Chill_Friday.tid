title: 2019.04.12 - Afterschool Teaching: Chill Friday

We had a conversation about one of my gay students. Matt sent the student to a counselor; this was fascinating considering the discussion which occurred yesterday (the student talked with other students about it in the library). The folks in the office talked shit. Delp noted my silence and asked me for my opinion for the sake of census building or for warning the others I'm not one of them. He's not actually looking for my opinion though, and if he were, I'd help him fix his identity as painlessly as I could. Thus, I said my brother was gay, and I related to the issue. Of course, everyone else in the room thinks it is a sin. They don't want gay people to die, but they think homosexuals deserve to suffer social stigmas.

5NP continues to be absent. Hm.

Oh, 8Hf and 8MY might be flirting with boys in the hallway again (RED ALERT EVERYONE, ZOMG), and now we must trap them from the possibility. It still kills me that it's taken for granted the girls should be imprisoned, but never the guys in question. Matt, Delp, and Whitney are maddened by the need to control the situation, plan, and gossip about irrelevance. It is a world of appearances, and I'm morally obligated to fight fire with fire here.

Mitchell and Delp are both gone. Matt is in charge. He continues to come in to inspect how my library time goes. Lol. He was hesitant about allowing us to use the library, even for homework. He then changed his mind and requires them to stay with me until 4:15 (rather than being free to head to the gym). Micro-management is sad. I am pleased to see he's cutting some of the rougher kids more slack though.

This is actually the reason he doesn't like teaching high school. He doesn't like how they are too familiar with him. His understanding of respect branches into authoritarian rhetoric and social domination. Don't get me wrong: coercion can be justified, but that's not what he's after. This is power tripping for him, status in a community, and the safety of being one of them.

I continue to preach the realpolitik [[Straussian]] phone gospel.

Some folks read. I lurv you. 5:24f and I talked about her biology book.

5KB played chess with me, and I helped some of the others play too. I had lots of stragglers come and go. Mostly small conversations. 6CM and 7Jm freestyled for us. I keep trying to give them spaces for it.

I had several students tell me I'm their favorite teacher. That is nice of them.

One of my goals is to give kids the space to speak with each other in respectful manners without censoring. I continue to draw the lines. Physical violence against yourself and others is not okay. Telling me you are suicidal, even jokingly, will always elicit action from me. Verbal abuse which is not playfully in jest in symmetric power dynamics will be intervened upon. Do not destroy the library or computer lab. Disrupt my children from doing their homework, and I'll rapidly escalate into quarantining you. I will attempt to convince you not to get in trouble with the prison guards, especially when it affects everyone, and I'll offer you approaches to flying under the radar and fighting surveillance against almost any authority in your life. If you lie to me, I'm going to tell you I think you're lying or that I don't trust you. You can't play until your homework is done either. However, having met those conditions, go on, play on your phones, swear away, no topics are off limits, read whatever you want to read, use the resources we have, and I'm not here to dominate. I am blind and deaf wherever I can, unless you make me laugh (it's often the case they will look to me for reactions in this game of feeling out where my lines are drawn). I will hand your ass to you in dialectics and games. If you actually need me to play pretend with you, young child, I will. I am listening, and if you are in trouble, you need to tell me.

The janitor and I talked about ghost-hunting, his upcoming trip, his granddaughter and family, philosophy, and our lives. He is shockingly tolerant for being so conservative, and I do not understand his optimism (it is joyous). He is the only man there who knows me and my direct respect. He comes from nothing, and he is a man of great honor. He is the only man in the entire building to whom I bow. It is my privilege. You are real to me, sir.
