title: 2017.05.23 - Link Log

I had some links ready for yesterday, but I didn't log them. Today may be a bit longer for it, we'll see.<<ref "2018.11.21">>

* https://www.salon.com/2017/05/22/president-cuck-trump-supporters-are-freaking-out-over-the-presidents-tone-change-on-islam/
** Give it time. I believe the vast majority will eventually flip. Many already have. The diehard fucktards require more evidence. This, of course, may be forgotten. Let us hope they finally see it.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6cp23n/president_cuck_trump_supporters_are_freaking_out/dhwb5z9/
** Connected to the previous. I found this to be an interesting post.
* http://www.continentcontinent.cc/index.php/continent/article/viewArticle/48
** I must admit, I'm growing too stupid, tired, and perhaps lazy to even attempt to answer the question anymore. Maybe it is just stoicism. I have enormous sympathy for object-oriented ontology at times (particularly on DCK).

** Surprisingly reasonable socialist "propaganda"
* https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/05/21/young-men-falling-bottom-income-ladder/ncYhOoItuoqdlApn6qZRSL/story.html
** We've not hit peak unrest. I believe these young men will eventually erupt.
* https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/22/the-white-house-is-trying-to-dupe-the-new-york-times-with-phony-leaks/?wprss=rss_the-fix&tid=sm_tw_pp
** I'm shocked! Lots of reasons for it, it appears.

** I weep. The stupidity infects us all.

** I guess it must be our fault that we don't have jobs. That's honestly the next move a conversative would make from this argument (which is hardly true).
* https://github.com/chaosbot/chaos
** A beautiful, democratized social experiment (like the publicly played Pokemon game, or the international Chess tournament (World vs. Kasparov, or whatever)). 
* https://qz.com/987557/the-inevitable-future-of-slack-is-your-boss-using-it-to-spy-on-you/
** I did not like Slack before. I really don't like it now that I understand what it really is.
* https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-19/unemployment-in-the-u-s-is-falling-so-why-isn-t-pay-rising
** Employers have absolutely all the power in this relationship. There is no bargaining power. Workers are fundamentally enslaved to this system. They half-heartedly appear open to the possibility.
** U3 Unemployment looks better, but it is not the fitting measurement of true unemployment. Get it out of your heads. You've missed the boat. There is a glut of overqualified workers available to employers. Underemployment is extremely common. Babyboomers keeping their jobs because they never saved for retirement (or gave a shit about the future in the first place, psychopaths) continues to be part of it. 
** They are right that the Phillips curve is effectively dead.
** Your savvy capitalists know why, but they aren't going to be open about it. They have too much to gain from your ignorance. This article's bottomline is half-assed blarney, on purpose.
** Talk about predictive powers: Marx has it fucking pegged, assholes.

** IPFS may eventually take off. Godspeed, good people.

*** A great quote: There's also the premise of global superpowers locked into a theater of permanent economic conflict and the implicit balance of power perpetually threatening to break open and destabilize into massive full-spectrum conflict...Given the state of nature that exists between large industrialized nations, each in incentivized to foment dysfunction in their rivals to slow them down economically. The more infighting in any given country, the more headaches present among citizens, the slower and more reluctant their economy becomes...There's a slow, glacial, permanent grind that never goes away, because the world at large is trying to make you call in sick to work, so that they can gain some breathing room, and pump up their own economy...Meanwhile, uncompetitive personality flaws get classified as mental illness, so that there's medical justification to ply you with productivity drugs. Take prescribed speed to perform for the economy. Take mood stabilizers so you don't snap at your co-workers. Take anti-anxiety meds for your impostor syndrome, and stop worrying about whether everyone hates you. They're all just cranky from the speed and psychological operations of global superpowers trying to slow us down.
**** I don't agree with it all, but some of it is obviously correct.

** Fuck Comcast

** Offloading more of our computing to centralized servers. 
** I can't imagine not typing. There are too many quirks that a computer just can't capture at this point. There are too many times where my writing something down is exactly what jogs my memory, allows me to see what my thinking visually, or changes how I think about something. Perhaps it will change. We will see.

** Thank you yet again, Babyboomers.

<<footnotes "2018.11.21" "ROFL! OMG. I really do set the bar ridiculously high for myself. At this point, I feel accomplished for pushing out a single [[Link Log]] every week. I feel like I'm drowning, and clearly, I didn't feel like I was drowning back then. That said, I consumed a lot more braincandy, IIRC. I allow links to just stew and digest in my firehose of tabs and windows, and now I select [[the salience]] of the practice differently. I am glad I have moved toward this pragmatic approach.">>
