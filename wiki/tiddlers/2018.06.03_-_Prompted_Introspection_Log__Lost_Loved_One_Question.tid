title: 2018.06.03 - Prompted Introspection Log: Lost Loved One Question

!! Think of a loved one that you have lost. If you could ask this person one question, what would you ask, and what do you think they would say?

Tell me about how I ask them this question. That I could ask them at all answers crucial kinds of questions for me. To ask, "is there a life after death?" (which I'm generally unworried about) would already be answered, depending on how it would be answered. If we somehow just animated their corpse, built an AI of them from their diaries, or we reverse engineer the lightcone around them and physics itself (and somehow impossibly the metaphysics necessary to answer this question), we'd have done far more important things. Somehow, in trying to answer how this loved one might answer this question we've answered questions far more important than what I might ask them (or at least equivalently important ones).

I suppose that's not what you wanted me to think about. Fine, here's your brutal Sunday school answer, Samwise:

I've lost my parents. They are now my donor-exploiters. The false-images/models/theories of who they were (and are) have been ripped away from me. I'd ask these idealized imaginary persons, those whom I thought were real, who they really are. I'd want them to explain themselves to themselves by having to explain it to me.

I suspect these creatures, possessing intelligence and knowledge beyond what we can have, would be able to explain the story of who we are in a powerful. The gap is incommensurable by my part, at this point. I cast pearls before swine.

You continue to fail the [[T42T]]-based [[Wiki Litmus Test]] in my [[Find The Others]] [[axiom|Axioms of h0p3]]. It takes two to tango. My bridge is epic; there has never been anything like it in the history of humankind. The burden of fault, ultimately, does not rest on my shoulders.
