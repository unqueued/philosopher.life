title: 2018.09.28 - BAGD: To Paper

Computers are drugs, and if you can't control that habit, then it controls you. We have to try paper now. That is hugely limiting.

I don't have CS hardcover books, though I can get them. Unfortunately, despite the arguments I've seen against it, I'm still convinced that practical CS is still best done ON the computer. We'll keep trying!

The computer-based learning is now off the table. They still will have to graft at the end of the day.
