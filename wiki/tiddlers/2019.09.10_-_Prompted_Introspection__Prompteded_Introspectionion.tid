title: 2019.09.10 - Prompted Introspection: Prompteded Introspectionion

!! What is your most treasured possession?

Holy Reredundancy Batmanmanmanmanman, I've answered this before:

* [[2017.05.15 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
* [[2018.10.13 - Prompted Introspection: Prized Possession]]
* [[2018.12.29 - Prompted Introspection: Most Important Possession]]

They do tell a story, don't they, Samwise? Hrm. Now I offer one which would make [[Saint Kant]] and [[Saint Oliver Sensen]] proud: my autonomy. That thing which makes me the me-iest me of all the me's connected to the possibly infinitely splintered and rhizomatically enmeshed (perhaps even schizophrenically unified into all other perspectives) Transworld Identity. My freedom is my essence. My choices define who I am. My motivation of my acts, my actions, in my circumstances are what I really really am. I can't say I always enjoy this self-possession which only I can own and wield (though many can twist or destroy). It's that Korsgaardian Plight, yo.

Of course, my answer on 2018.10.13 is considered the same by some hardcore Kantians (not that they would appreciate my phrasing). What a move! Wow! It's a shame I'm an incompatibilist going straight into mysticism. Yeah, that still may be right, but I have no idea how it works.
