Remember: 10am on July 10th. That's when you need to be there.

I called today at 3. I should have called earlier, I guess. My boss, Ben, did not understand what I was asking for. He thought he just needed to approve it (and I didn't receive any word back of approval on it either, lol). I couldn't have been clearer in my explanation. I take this to be a bad sign.

He went back over the letter and called me back. He apologized for dropping the ball. He said he couldn't do it since we were already away from the office. He was hoping he didn't need to the letterhead, else he could have done it while away. I explained the problem. His solution was to have another worker at the office do it Monday. He clearly did not understand what I had said to him. Today was the deadline. I think he might be partially illiterate. That's okay. He's taking a chance on me, and I need this to work. 

That said, even if I don't have my tools immediately, I can wait. I'll have an excuse. I'll see what I can do. He did just rubberstamp my awesome list though. Woot!
