title: 2018.01.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Ideal Pet

!! What is your ideal pet?

I'm going to stray away from the ideal of ideal pets, the kind that are genies and wish-granters, etc. I am also unsure what counts as a pet, so I cannot quite give you The Good of it. That standard just isn't obvious to me. 

What is the purpose of a pet? I suppose it is to provide us company, to give us something to care for, to enable us to empathize, and perhaps to fulfill some primal needs in ourselves.

I can't quite say what would be ideal for me. In a way, I don't know myself well enough to be able to answer what it is that I need in a pet. If I did, I think I would pursue it. I can tell you my guttural thought is to have pets with the lowest cost requirements. I like fish, for example. I have always wanted a jellyfish. I think they are really cool.
