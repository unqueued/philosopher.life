title: 2018.02.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Doing Something Wrong

!! How do you feel when you do something wrong?

Well, guilty, of course. Allow me to at least talk a bit about I mean by //wrong//. 

I don't think the moral law is well understood or followed by humanity in general. Social expectations are often very poor indications of what is morally right and wrong. There are social rights and wrongs, legal rights and wrongs, and essentially mores and norms for a variety of contexts. These are mere rules without any true normative bite outside of hypothetical imperatives. I seek only that which is fundamentally moral and nothing else. Essentially, I'm willing to bet that your opinion on the matter is likely wrong itself. 

Unfortunately, I am only left with the law I have constructed in my own mind as a shadow of the moral law itself. I do my best. Sometimes I know I have violated the very principles to which I bound myself. Sometimes, I improve my shadow and realize that what I thought before (and how I acted before) was wrong. I am guilty on both accounts. I attempt to apologize to the person(s) I have wronged, restore the victim, and figure out a way to avoid the problem. Usually, if I've done something wrong, there was a reason for it. I search for the reason, wrestle with it, and attempt to fix the tension. Lately, particularly since I've started this wiki, I've also been trying to forgive myself.
