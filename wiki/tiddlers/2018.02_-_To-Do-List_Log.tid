* Weekly
** I'm pretty unhappy with what I accomplished in [[Employment]] over the course of a month. I need to keep trucking. It's okay that I failed, and I need to stand back up to try even harder. It's okay. Be compassionate with yourself while steering yourself in the right direction. You aren't perfect; never give up.
** I am really glad I contacted the electrician union and went through the process. I need to contact them again.
** I'm pleased with having acquired digital transcripts. I'll always be able to provide them easily now. I like that. I've already had to use them twice now.
** Milligan didn't work out, and that's okay. It's weird that he sent me an official letter with a hand-written portion. I'm not sure what to make of that. 
*** The cynic in me thinks it is mere social signaling and nothing else (and that is ultimately likely correct). Exactly what is meant by this social signal, I do not know. There are different interpretations available to me.
** I did a lot of work reaching out to my family.
** I've been learning more about what exactly it is I'm trying to even build as a machine in [[Employment]], and I can say I'm pleased about that. There are particular aspects which have been developing well.
** I clearly need drugs to perform well in the week. Dependence, yes. Addiction? I'm not convinced.
** I'm really pleased we have specifically set time aside each time for eating and talking together. It's not always smooth, and it can be emotionally draining, but I'm glad we do it.
** Ugh, I can see I failed a lot.
** I also worry I'm not good at setting expectations.

* Daily
** I got a lot of technical work done.
** These all seem very simple.
** I did a reasonable job finishing what I set out to do each day.
** I feel bad about my failings.
** I'm impressed with my attempt to construct principles which guide and constitute me.
** I thoroughly enjoyed FBZlam. I was too worried about it. I'm glad, however, that I've been extremely cautious about it. It is clearly a dangerous substance when not handled with the utmost control.
** I'm really proud of where we've come as a family in making our meals and eating together. I will always remember these times, and I'm so happy we have had the opportunity.
** None of the shows seem to be sticking with us.
** I worked hard on [[Interviewing]] and it shows!
** I'm glad I drew up a list for my children on Saturday. I need to continue doing that.
** I have mixed feelings about how I do this log. I wish I was more specific in my workload, what exactly I hoped to accomplish.
