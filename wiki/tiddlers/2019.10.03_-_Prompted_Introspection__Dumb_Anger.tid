title: 2019.10.03 - Prompted Introspection: Dumb Anger

!! What is something that really makes you angry?

I thoroughly answer this question throughout the wiki. My anger builds, but I also do my best to compartmentalize and channel it. This is such a common topic, I'm going to move to say something interesting instead.

Here's a dumb one: I get angry with games or sometimes developers for poor ludological construction in game balance, fairness, and arbitrarily or avoidably eliminating the value of investing myself into anything. I think most gamers younger than me prefer the constantly updating, patched, tweaked, DLCed, and capriciously evolving metagames (get off my lawn!). It may be the case I have a different approach to interpreting the kinds of stories my vidja games  generate about who I am. I have left plenty of games over this, and it's one of the few things which breaks my addiction. All this said, I don't think this is why I have been gaming less, on average, each year (or, the games I find interesting aren't so virtual).
