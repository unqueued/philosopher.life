title: The End of Humanity

//I dedicate this page to Immanuel Kant and Morpheus.//

If I ever was a prophet, this is my prophecy: 

* The end of humanity is coming in the next 100 years. Our extinction is coming, whether we admit it to ourselves or not.<<ref "1">>
* Variations in the current wars on the planet will only escalate until the end. We will be drowned in violence and the guttural cruelty quietly embedded in all animals. As a species, we will attempt to migrate and flee, but there will be nowhere to go.
* The wealthy, powerful, kleptocratic elite will continue to enslave the poor and disenfranchised, bit by bit, until the end. We have been all functionally commodified and reduced to mere flesh-sacks of human capital having our economic value extracted from us by the layer of people above us in a giant human pyramid scheme. Wealth and power will continue to centralize, privatize, and crystallize toward the top, while the material position, mobility, freedom, and happiness of the masses below will shrink each year. We are in for the last, most epic tragedy of the commons, a bitter human-eat-human world where we hungrily use and destroy each other for the remaining resources on this planet. The elite (who already see and accept the end, who have thrown away any plans for the future and instead enjoy whatever pleasure they can, while they still can) will watch us suffer and die, consuming each layer of the pyramid below them until it is their turn to suffer and die.
* The Great Famine is coming. At least hundreds of millions will starve, but billions will die for a lack of clean water, the new commodity. 
* Global warming seals our fate. It accelerates and accelerates. We are past the point of saving. Even in my lifetime, I will be transplanted and crippled by this force of justice we created.

It's the truth.<<ref "2">> It's the awful fucking truth that we all secretly try to deny and hide from ourselves. Admittedly, it isn't much of a prophecy. After all, this is the description of the world which every mildly-informed realist can see. We generally lack the balls, brutal honesty, and raw intellectual integrity to openly admit this is the most likely (and perhaps inevitable) outcome and allow that fact to descend upon our reality maps. Everyone knows it, and yet they have the capacity and will to turn their gaze away from the truth. We run from this truth. We block and bracket it from our minds. The truth is too painful. Lying to ourselves is the only practical option. 

Fuck those who turn away from idealism; we have cost ourselves everything. We are stupid, selfish, short-sighted, and evil. Malice and ignorance are all too often two sides of the same coin (our ignorance has a causal story which eventually demonstrates that it was willed).<<ref "3">> 

Every person has their price. Deep down, as part of the core of our animal selves, we are all psychopaths who, when put to The Test, will eventually turn a blind eye to the pain of the other; all it takes is the right context to flip the switch inside us that turns off our empathy for humanity. We all already do it. It is who we are. We are able to blind ourselves to the enslavement and pain of others, to the way our choices and actions rest upon a causal chain of treating humans around the world as mere means, to the brutal use of others as instruments rather than respecting them as ends in themselves. "Out of sight, out of mind," we tell ourselves, lies. We have no integrity. Our altruism is a confabulation. We are mere animals who delude ourselves into thinking we are more, that we are exceptional, that we really can overcome our evil nature. 

Maybe we deserve this. If we don't, then why am I born into this world only to helplessly watch it die? Why did I bring children into this world only to watch them suffer? I'm a fool. I love them with everything I have. I will give them what little happiness I can. I will shield them and train them for as long as I can. It is my duty as their creator and the only reason I have left to live.

Why have empathy for my future self when I know that end is so painful? It is better to distance him from myself. It is better to not feel his pain because there is nothing I can do about it. This is the stoic, pragmatic move, the rationalization to impulsivity.

I have little hope for humanity, and I hate this world. I hate who we are. It makes me wish there was an agential God so I could tell that psychopathic piece of shit to go fuck Himself. Reason led me to faith, and reason destroyed it. I don't think there is a God to wrestle with anymore, there is only myself and the pursuit of [[Humanity]].

Here's the real truth: we are not free to be happy; we are slaves to suffering. My new [[hope]] is to accept these facts, to let the pieces fall where they may on my reality map, to move on, and to try and find peace and happiness in the midst of this farcical nightmare we call life. I need to move the goalposts, to restructure my perspective, to stop seeking reason in important ways. Finding constructive delusion and ignorance, a new faith, may be the only practical path.<<ref "s">>
