!! Audit:

* Fascinating to look at another game as I'm addicted to WoW.
* You know, our relationships with our neighbors continue to be at arms length.
* I have been drifting, going with the flow, and it shows in my lax attitude toward my responsibilities.
* The thought of violence coming as we plunge again has been overwhelming me.
** I am not opposed to it. It is morally obligated. It just kills me inside.
* I'm lucky to have the people in my life who put up with my insanity.
* You know, this month feels way more off the cuff than usual. 
* While we have not connected in a while, I'm really happy for [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. He gives me hope.
* It's been a masturbatory month.
* I need to temper my expectations further.
