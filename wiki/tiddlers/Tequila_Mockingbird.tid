title: Tequila Mockingbird

I'm a cheap, brainless alcoholic. Sure, I like cocktails, but my palate is simply uncultured. I aim to keep it that way too, god damnit. Why the fuck would you habituate a fine-grained perception of this practice? That's retarded. I can give no moral justification beyond the contrived (e.g. doomsday device will go off unless you become an expert in the next month). Of course, plenty of academic philosophers I know are hipsters who dig this shit. My jazz musician friend in NO likes to play bartender. Hell, plenty of my peers have bartended for a living. I don't know jack shit about it, and this book was a confirmation that I've not wasted my life as wastefully as I could have (oops). I've never been to a bar to drink, but I have peed in one before (the bathroom, ofc). Needless to say, I have no use for a cocktail book, especially since I can search the interwebs for these exact recipes (these were nothing special).

No, the book's real purpose is to be a cute, giftable, kitschy toy, and that it does. It's a pretty book, and some of the jokes are clever. You should drink as you read it. The graphics were generated through an optimized photoshop script, and it's basically a good blog disguised as a book. I suppose I'm supposed to make fun of the inauthenticity of this object; my dissent has been commodified (hrmm, I wish I could have picked the books it glosses over, rofl). The book is like a dick joke, butt for boo~~b~~ze. In reality, it's a home-bar talking piece for people who have nothing better to discuss. Fuck [[smalltalk]]; let's just think about who we are together while getting hammered and/or [[show me your genitalia|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqXi8WmQ_WM]].

The drinking games in the back will get you killed (I need to play these games with some people I've met).
