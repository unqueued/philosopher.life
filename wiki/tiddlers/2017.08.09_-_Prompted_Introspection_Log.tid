!! What was the most recent compliment youâ€™ve received and savoured?

Today. My journeyman co-worker explicitly asked for me to tell him my opinions, thoughts, and ideas because I came up with solutions he wasn't able to. He realized I'm good at thinking about pipefitting, even though I have very little experience. He's worried about looking stupid in front of the foreman (as he pointed out), and my insights benefit him. I like being listened to based upon merit. I think a lot of my opinions and ideas have merit, but few listen.
