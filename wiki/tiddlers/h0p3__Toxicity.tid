title: h0p3: Toxicity

//Am I the asshole? Am I subjectively a bad person to you? Am I objectively a bad person to you?//

Subjective toxicity and objective toxicity are not conceptually identical, and it is possible to distinguish justified and unjustified toxicity. Thus, handling fundamental disagreement and outgrouping is hard!

To say the least, a toxic person has an unappealing personality and negative interactions with others. Toxic people are subjectively rude, fail to fit our predictive models of what counts as being conventionally nice, and they are displeasurable to be around. It's true that many toxic people I've met are immorally so. I've also met people I considered toxic, unappealing, and draining who ultimately changed my life in a good, right, and justified way, even if it was extremely painful. Sometimes I really am the asshole, and I'm blind to it. I've been wrong about justified and unjustified toxicity in myself and others many times. Much like how easy it can be to fail to distinguish between kindness and niceness, it is often convenient to generalize toxicity as conceptually wrong. Who doesn't initially wish to dismiss out of hand those who make us feel bad? Objectively, however, sometimes we are bad, and we should feel bad. If we do not accept objective normativity, there is no coherent case to make against apparently unjustifiable toxicity.

Godwin's Law counterpoint: what does a toxic person phenomenologically look and feel like to Nazis? Just because someone is outgrouped to us doesn't mean we have a right to maintain that outgrouping. Indeed, we cannot exclusively trust our feelings all the way down. This is why we rely upon reason. In virtue theory, we would say that the vicious agent lacks the virtuous perception to recognize the virtue of the virtuous agent; in fact, the vicious agent will viciously claim virtue to be vice in many cases. 

It has been proven to me time and time again: not everyone who has called the validity of my identity into question has been wrong. They have, even to a minor [[dok]], been validly toxic to me in the retaliatory moves of [[T42T]]. Indeed, dialectical integrity, humility, and constructing ourselves with the [[other]] is sacrificially expensive, existential-crisis-inducing, terrifyingly painful, and wildly easier said than done.

Moral outrage is not conceptually immoral. We will suffer the paradox of tolerance to be morally outraged by all possible instances of moral outrage. Toxicity, similarly, is not always normatively as it appears. Cleanser looks and feels toxic to toxicity. If there is justification at all, some toxicity is justified. This is the [[gfwiwcgws]] problem. Just because something isn't //good for// an agent doesn't mean it's not [[good]] or [[right]] more generally. Indeed, even the majority can be wrong! This is a serious problem in understanding the nature of cooperation. It is likely a fideistic problem.

I'm not perfect. Here I will attempt to defend myself against the variations of the claim that I am unjustifiably toxic most of the time. You be the judge.

!! Toxic people like to be heard rather than listening to themselves-only through being heard can they access source energy.

This is the vampire argument. Obviously, I want to be heard. I often think I have the right to be heard. Do I only thrive upon being heard? Not exactly. I usually find it painful to make myself heard. Given the people around me, I am classically introverted. Most people are incredibly draining to me, and I derive most of my energy being with and by myself.<<ref "c">>

I suggest I speak to myself at great length even when nobody is paying attention. I consider myself a non-trivial source of my own energy in my [[self-dialectic]]. I value who I am to a significant [[dok]], and I listen to myself and others extensively. 

The charge gets one kind of vice correct but does not specify enough about the other side of the spectrum. I admit, codifiable precision is difficult here. It is my contention that part of the energy which drives me //should// be external to me.<<ref "g">> If I only ever derived my value and energy from myself, then I really haven't seriously taken [[others]] into account. That itself is unacceptably vicious as well, and demonstrably vampiric in the material dialectic. All things being equal, we should often feel bad when others don't listen to us, and we should empathically derive some of our energy based upon our interactions with others.

Virtue is a golden mean between two vices in a given context. In most cases, I think the moral answer requires a fair mix of energy sources. [[The Golden Rule]] means taking both myself and [[others]] to be equal sources of energy in my autonomous computation. The goal of [[The Moral Law]] is to not make an exception of myself, and that becomes radically complicated when we universalize particulars of our context. This is why people naively think Kant is wrong, but they simply haven't been charitable enough to fill in the computational gaps.


---
!! A toxic person is generally a negative person.

That is probably a correct statement with a powerful philosophical lense. It depends on how we interpret it. From a parsec-high view, negation appears to be half of construction in the dialectic. There is no positive without the negative and vv. It's a conceptually necessary concept. There's no construction without deconstruction either, and hence my {[[axiom]]}: [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]]. Post-modernism can be understood as deconstruction taken to such an extreme degree that it reduces everything to relative meaninglessness. On this account, I take most living people to lean toward being a negative person in terms of how they see us constructing together; that's part of why I consider us to still be living in a postmodern ideological era.

The negation of negation is positive, right?<<ref "d">> It appears being negative about the negative is how we cultivate something positive. I cannot escape it. Thus, I cannot simply accept the charge above at face value. Negative to whom, in what respect, regarding what? The [[agi]] considerations are a huge problem in addressing justification in the dialectic. Negativity is a perspective, and sometimes being a generally negative person in a world is being negative [[irwartfrr]]!

Indeed, I'm usually a skeptical, cynical, negative, unhappy, depressed, and anxious person. Is an agent always unjustifiably toxic for having a negative disposition in any possible world? Surely not. You are free to call me an arrogant asshole for saying this: I believe there are contexts in which I am prodigiously skilled in deconstruction (and that's in part because I've taken modernism so seriously). Clearly, I have a disposition toward one vice here.

In my defense, I aim to be highly constructive in my relationships and in this wiki. I work incredibly hard to build something meaningful to us. I put my money where my mouth is. When I question someone's Bob Turtle, I'm putting mine on the line too. I seek to play fairly in the ante of the dialectic. I'm certainly not perfect though.

!! Toxic people are judgmental.

It sounds like we must judge toxic people. Go on: you be the judge, stonecaster. This is another standard postmodern critique which subverts itself.

Indeed, I'm going to need to "play semantics" with you here. Exactly what it means to be too judgmental in a context is something we must judge wisely. This is an [[infinigress]]ive problem at the heart of philosophy. I cannot resolve it for you, but I will do my best to make progress.

Long have I judged "judgment" to be conceptually necessary to wisdom (i.e. [[salient]] knowledge). Do I have a disposition to think too highly of the accuracy of my own judgment? Yes. As do we all! That's just what it means to be unwise [[irwrongfrr]]. 

Being too judgmental is lacking judgment [[irwartfrr]]. Conversely, not being judgmental enough is being too judgmental in a different way as well. Thus, I judge the claim above to be the following truism: unjustifiably toxic people are unjustified in their judgment. Yes, that is true, but like virtue theory: it circularly and unpragmatically lacks the particularistic computational content of [[The Moral Law]] (even while logically implying it).

As a contextualist, I judge it be false-humility to say I know nothing, lack any virtue whatsoever, or never have the right to make a judgment. Do I think my judgment tends to be more sound than others? Objectively, yes, but I also think radically more is expected of someone in a subjective position like mine. While I'm obviously [[fff]] (and always will be), I have not half-assed my pursuit of wisdom. Of course, my claim is cause for concern. Putting people in their place [[irwrongfrr]] is also a guttural reaction homo sapiens have in their languages games; we're built to punish people who do not cooperate with us in agreeing to the validity of our identities. Our amygdalas are the catalysts to the emotionally-driven self-defense of our identities in the dialectic. But, again, not all identities are valid to various [[dok]], and not all judgments of unjustified judgmentality are justified. 

When they get to know me: I am toxically judgmental to most humans, but I am not convinced unjustifiably so. This is yet another case in which Aristotelian-magnanimity is a requirement of unified moral virtue. 


---
!! Toxic people use love as a weapon and manipulation tactic.

Using other people's love as a weapon against them is immoral. I am not convinced you can use your own love as a weapon against the one you love: that isn't love. It is, of course, possible to signal love in many contexts without actually loving someone. That is extremely manipulative. 

One profound difficulty is the identity problem of //who// is being loved. For example, there are parts of myself that should not be. To really love that part of myself requires changing it. What is being loved in this case? It isn't the identity at face value; it is the dignity of that identity in virtue of what it ought to be. To really love Hitler correctly is to help him become not himself in some respect. This is one of the difficulties in handling Kantian autonomy: it's metaethically perfectionistic (with permissible ranges for we [[fff]]) in defining valid identities. 

Make no mistake: I am strategic in my communications with myself and others. I think my transparency, however, clearly reinforces my accountability. Argumentation, both philosophical and rhetorical, are dialectical weapons. There is such a thing as morally justified influence; otherwise human interaction would not be morally permissible. Do I manipulate others as //mere// means? I radically trying to do the opposite. This is yet another reason I painstakingly make argument after argument, line by line. 


---
!! Toxic people are selfish.

I would have previously argued that selfishness is conceptually immoral, but I've had to modify that claim. As I've said before, it turns out that [[The Golden Rule]] requires us to treat ourselves as having the dignity of [[others]]. Sometimes selfishness to some degree is morally required. I wouldn't say that is our usual inclination, but it is clearly possible to be viciously humble, failing to recognize one's self-worth, or not appropriately prioritizing or accounting for one's identity in the weighing of our competing beliefs and desires in the [[CI]]. We're morally obligated to strike the fitting balance between individualism and collectivism in our contexts. 

Alright, so presumably the claim is that //toxic people are unjustifiably selfish//. That's probably right, as long as we recognize how not all instances of toxicity are unjustified. 

I will agree: I'm combative, deny the validity of many aspects of most of the identities I face, and I often think I'm right in a way that people will call selfish. Why should I think my point of view has so much merit that I have the right to force other people to wrestle with it? Indeed, I am concerned about what I'm justifiably entitled to in my dialectics with others and myself! It is clear that I am wrong all the time, and unjustifiably wrong all the time as well. Insofar as I am not justified, I'm not entitled to be myself. 

I agree I am unjustifiably selfish in many contexts, and toxically so. It's not simply that I'm [[fff]]; I'm immorally so. While it may not be charged with offense most of the time, I do profoundly fail here! While I deny the charge that my toxicity is always unjustified, it is clear that I am still all-too-often unjustifiably selfish. My only defense: I am working on it.


---
!! Toxic people need to be right.

I do not trust people who say this phrase; it borders on mere rhetoric in common usage. I have had this one hypocritically wielded against me too many times. I have a problem with the way in which this phrase is ambiguously wielded. However, there appears to be a common sense interpretation or intuition embedded in the conversational implicature. The gist of it may be: the person is interested in the appearance of "winning" at face-value without appropriately pursuing truth, justification, or kindness. That behavior, of course, isn't right by definition!

Who doesn't need to be right? Toxic or non-toxic, justified or unjustified, need or want, consciously or unconsciously, we are all obligated to be right. It's self-deceptive to think you aren't aiming to be right. It's incoherent to say you ought not need to be right. You have no right not to rightly pursue what is right as righteously as you can.

When the phrase is meaningfully a criticism, it is in terms of whether or not we are justified in our dialectical behaviors. The claim is probably most fitting when we are pointing out how someone desperately clings to the belief they are justified when they aren't. Toxic people can be justified in desperately clinging to the belief they are right (the anti-nazi who is toxic to nazis [[irwartfrr]]). This is, again, a question of individual and collective wisdom and what we objectively owe to each other.

I'm not perfect, obviously, but I think it's fair to say I obsessively seek to hold up my end of the bargain in dialectics. It is not my experience that most of the time this criticism of me is valid, but I will agree the criticism fits me in many cases.


---
!! Toxic people are surrounded by drama.

There's a lot of connotation and meaning embedded in //drama//. Not all dramatic events or people are unjustifiably so, but many are. Drama is an experience machine, a rhetorical tool, and an emotional device; like all tools, it must be used wisely. Drama can be a good thing; simulated narratives and theatre can be instrumentally valuable, beautiful, and even morally obligated. Life is sometimes surrounded by drama. That's not what is intended by the above claim.

Drama which exists only virtue of deception or making claims without attempting to provide sufficient evidence is clearly unjustified. We might think of a Drama Queen as someone who is attention seeking. Starting drama may be out of boredom, treating others as mere means. I am hesitant to say someone who experiences a series of problems is definitionally unjustified (in fact, it appears that in many contexts, everyone should be handling one problem after another), but we my find some people who always seem to have one problem after another as being melodramatic. Some people really do have problems they should talk about; it depends on why you are telling your problems to someone else. Moral motivation is key to disentangling justified and unjustified drama.

It appears some people find neuroticism to be unjustifiably dramatic. I think that depends on the context. Intense emotions and high variability in emotional states can be morally required of us. Here we must define rationality. Insofar as drama is artificially couched as irrationality, then it must be unjustified. Experiencing and emoting appropriate reactions is another way to talk about virtue.

Many unjustifiably toxic people are unjustifiably dramatic. I'm not convinced toxic people are always surrounded by unjustified drama though. I agree, however, that toxicity is definitionally dramatic to some audience (though it need not necessarily be recognized by the target of the toxicity).

I don't consider myself dramatic on average, though surely there are dramatic parts of my identity, behavior, and interactions with others. I would rather the attention were on what mattered rather than on me; unfortunately, sometimes I'm the only person who can point out what matters. I strongly prefer trying to solve problems without unnecessary emotional costs. I don't think I have drama in most of my relationships even though I have strong feelings about people. I can be dramatic and I do stir up controversy in some cases though. Most of the time, what I find dramatically interesting most people don't care about at all. The shoe doesn't fit in this case. 


---
!! Toxic people lie.

There's too much ambiguity here. It is obvious that not all toxic people lie, especially since this includes justifiably toxic folks. It may be the case that to be unjustified is conceptually always a form of self-deception, in which case unjustified choices of any kind, including toxicity, will always be the result of at least lying to oneself.

I suggest the above claim is usually concerned with not just lying to oneself but also others. More specifically, I think it is concerned with many [[dok]] of deception in general rather than lying simpliciter. The kind of deception which uses others as mere means is a profound moral problem. Obviously, I'm not talking about the deception necessary to tell justified jokes or the surprise or privation of information necessary for some kinds of gift-giving; I assume it is already agreed that some kinds of deception are treating others as ends in themselves. My line-drawing becomes more complicated in that I am convinced we must lie to the axe-murderer at our doorstep. In a sense, I should be toxic and deceptive [[irwartfrr]] in that context.

The wrongness in question has less to do with toxicity than it does about the immorality of unjustified deception. That is the real issue.

In my experience, most people prefer I were less honest. We're heavily socialized to lie to each other. Deception is the norm, hence why most people care most about what you may be hiding than what you say. I aim to provide a non-trivial metaethical account of justified deception. As always, I'm not perfect, but I work really hard to keep myself honest.


---
!! Toxic people are always the victim.

That isn't carefully stated. Presumably, the intended claim is: unjustifiably toxic people always take themselves to be the innocent victim and never the guilty agent. That's not obviously true either; some people are openly evil. I can see that it's meant to be a rule-of-thumb, but I've seen this phrase used gaslitically and immorally-dismissively! 

I take it to be truism that one is unjustified in failing to appropriately take responsibility for oneself. That is often one of the issues at stake here. Sadly, I think many unjustifiably toxic people often have been profound victims. Breaking that cycle is not easy.

This is an area I work hard on: I aim to hold myself accountable. I talk about my failures pretty often, and this is something my children and I discuss often. This is a complex topic for me because I believe I see far more possibility in the world than most people. I hold us all far more responsible than is generally considered sane, thus many of my perspectives on the victims of capitalism and dark-triadic behavior are rejected out of hand. I'm going to point out victimhood, and I think I point it out fairly broadly.


---
!! Toxic people never have a nice word to say about others.

This phrase is almost ironic to me in how toxically overgeneralized it defines toxic people. I'm a fan of absolutist language [[irwartfrr]], but that's in virtue of how difficult it can be to use it wisely.

I will also point out how there is a difference between kindness and niceness. It is true I have an extremely high standard. I am convinced most people live invalid lives. That said: I reguarly compliment people, and I go out of my way to do so because I know my gut instinct is to pessimistically see what's wrong with who we are at the expense of what we do right. This is an area I aim to grow in.

I would argue that the most unjustified toxic people I know are profoundly effective at using compliments, back-handed compliments, sarcasm, and niceness lacking kindness to manipulate others and engineer social situations to suit them. 


---
!! Toxic people take no responsibility for their own feelings.

Again, we have a disagreement about the difference between unjustified and justified toxicity. In many cases, toxic people aren't justified. 

I am, of course, worried about how we take responsibility for ourselves. There are limits to how we can control our feelings. Usually, I don't take us to have immediate control of //what// we are feeling, but we do have control over how we do with it to a signficant degree. How we habituate ourselves does give us indirect control (and thus responsibility) for our feelings. That appears to be the point of this claim.

I work hard to manage my feelings and pursue the causes of them. I'm certainly not perfect at it, but I don't think this claim can effectively target me.


---
!! Toxic people do not apologize.

This is a fallacious claim. Plenty of toxic people, both justified and unjustified, apologize. Some even mean it! It's really hard to be someone who doesn't apologize at all under any circumstances whatsoever.

I apologize. Sometimes it's for small things, sometimes it's for big things. Meaningfully apologizing is something I have to do as an abrasive person. Apologizing when I'm obviously the only person at fault is easier than when both parties at fault. It's especially difficult and recursive when I'm in disagreement about what we should be apologizing for.

I think a better criticism of me is that I'm too slow to recognize when I'm at fault. 


---
!! Toxic people like to complain rather than finding solutions to their problems.

Toxicity can take the form of complaining. I think some people have every right to complain as much as they do. In fact, I'm blown away by some people who don't even recognize their own victimhood appropriately. I take it that unjustified toxic people are seeking attention rather than restoration.

I'm definitely a complainer, but I'm definitely working to find solutions. I realize many people don't find my solutions realistic, but I also don't think they recognize my complaints as being realistic either. I defer to the concept of justification, yet again. 


---
!! Toxic people make you feel drained.

I'm a fan of talking about dark-triadicism in terms of vampiric draining. I'll agree that both justified and unjustified toxic people are draining. Babies are draining. Helpless people can be draining. Non-toxic people are draining to some people too. Almost all homo sapiens are draining to me, and I believe I'm incredibly draining to speak with in depth.

This reminds me of the fact that extroversion and introversion are relative to a context. Rewarding the acquisition of energy from dealing with others can be a two-edged sword; capitalism generates vampires. Drainingness, however, is not conceptually wrong. The issue to my eyes is: when do you have a moral right to cause others to spend emotional energy?

This is [[T42T]] territory to me. It is usually the discussion of morality itself that people find so draining with me, imho. I think topic is worth the emotional sacrifice and spending my social capital with others.


---
!! Toxic people are inconsistent.

I take it you mean unjustifiably toxic people do not tell consistent stories about themselves and the world. Honesty and coherence is fundamental to integrity. However, I must point out that evil agency exists, and that highly-integrated psychopaths can tell fairly consistent stories. Their goal is to lie to themselves and others at just the right moments.

I'm fairly consistent, and I am radically transparent. I'm practically paranoid about my lack of consistency too. 


---
!! Toxic people make you prove yourself to them.

I consider it toxic behavior not to hold people accountable; that's not [[The Golden Rule]] either. I think the real issue is being the guilty party in the asymmetry of these signaling dynamics. I do not ask proof of others that I'm not willing to give myself. In fact, I aim to make myself vulnerable in providing proof in a radical way up front. [[fff]] though I may be, I put my money where my mouth is.


---
!! Toxic people are not supportive of what is important to you.

I am definitely toxic to people who don't have valid identities. Just because you value something doesn't mean it is valuable. I do not support evil. Again, we are dealing with the notion of justification; toxicity is sometimes morally obligated of us in the dialectic.

One of the problems people face with me is that I have an enriched conception of human flourishing to the point that most people will accuse me of ludicrous moral perfectionistism (I suggest they are quite uncharitable to the notion of particularism in my case). 

This is one of the radical theses in my wiki. I strongly care about why others believe what they do, and I'm trying to demonstrate my best understanding of what objectively matters. My dialectics are incredibly personal.


---
!! Toxic people nitpick your successes and efforts.

I assume the claim is that unjustified toxic people won't praise you [[irwartfrr]]. Obviously, nobody is perfect, and we should aim to encourage others. Of course, we should at the same time think about [[The End]]s of our efforts. I won't praise success toward something immoral. Motivation and the goal matters even more than the instrumental means which bring them about.

I should also point out that some of the most successful dark-triads I've met are profoundly skilled flatterers. Compliments are often cheap and shallow. Substance and taking people seriously is a much more complex commitment. 

I think empathy and practicing [[The Golden Rule]] is fundamentally concerned about constructing yourself with the other, including the details. Weighing becomes far harder to do in disagreement. I aim to show my integrity here.


---
!! Toxic people regress with age rather than mature.

I suppose a lot is packed into "mature" here. From my perspective, after your frontal lobes are crystallized, after your personality begins to tighten and be stripped down, and your predictive coding becomes streamlined: most people begin to lose conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness. I find most people tend to become increasingly politically conservative, selfish, dark-triadic, and uninterested what they owe to others. Perhaps that will change; it's not like I have enough anecdata, nor have we enough generations and variation in our contexts to know.

I don't think I'm regressing, but I see evidence of losing memories and significant psychological disorders in me. I'm probably losing my mind.


---
!! Toxic people are manipulative.

That is often true. Plenty of toxic people aren't manipulative as well. Of course, we're back to justification. I will lie to the axe-murderer at my doorstep. I think many people are forced to wear makeup to be treated with the respect they merited even without it. I believe we have to fight against biases in a society that won't be doubleblind in how it evaluates us. Justice against the unjust requires memetic retaliation, but obviously, only with powerful justification. Sometimes it is our moral duty to be toxic to dark-triadicism.

All of that said, I rail against manipulation which treats others as mere means. It is true that many people have no idea who they are dealing with when they talk to me, but I aim to make that as clear to them as I can. My reasoning is as open as I know how to make it.


---
!! Toxic people are more interested in what you can give them rather than adding to your life.

Unjustified toxicity is dark-triadically egoistic and individualistically selfish. I am still learning how best to serve others. I think if I wanted to be evil, I would. That doesn't mean I don't do anything wrong, but if this is about my average interest, it's pretty clear I'm not looking to take more than I give. In the same way that I see a fairly expansive set of possibilities for what the world ought to be, I see the possibilities for how I could climb the human pyramid too. That's not who I want to be.


---
!! Toxic people make everything in life seem complex and difficult.

We're back to justification. Some of the teachers who I've learned from the most were toxic to my identity. They were even mean about it on purpose! They made my life far more complex and difficult, and I'm glad they did. Of course, I've had plenty of toxic people in my life who were unjustified in the way in which they made my life harder.

I definitely make the lives of people more complex and difficult in many cases. I often make it easier or even possible for some people to transition too. Am I unjustified in my interactions with others? I'm doing my best not to be! I desperately don't want to be a hypocrite.
