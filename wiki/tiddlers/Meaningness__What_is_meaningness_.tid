title: Meaningness: What is meaningness?

* https://meaningness.com/what-is-meaningness

<<<
The word “meaning” has two quite different meanings in English. It can refer to the meaning of symbols, such as words and road signs. This book is not about that kind of meaning. 
<<<

I think we have a different understanding of consciousness as it relates to language. Are you absolutely sure you want to say this? I fear you've already failed right here.

<<<
Meaningness is a quality, not a thing. I don’t think there is a definite meaning of life. Meaningness is always nebulous: indefinite, uncertain, ambiguous. 
<<<

For it to be a thing would be eternalist or nihilistic, I take it? You mean to say that it is a predicate, a property, a quality, a relationship of one or more things. Moreover, you wish to say these aren't set in stone, and that many things are devoid of them at different times, from different perspective, etc.

What gives it those qualities? 

Ah, surely cannot agree there isn't a definite meaning...isn't that meaningness, in a sense, is trying to address. The "middle way" you think you are paving for us is that definite meaning, right? Why do you get to help yourself to it?

I think you are trying to sweep existential semiotics out of the way here, or you aren't being careful enough.

<<<
The suffix -ness constantly reminds one of this nebulosity. 
<<<

I can tell you lack the hallmarks and signs of someone with formal philosophical education. F-ness screams out Platonism to me. I literally see you trying to help yourself to it throughout this work so far. You are aiming for the //essential// qualities (your word) of meaning. Essentialism, unfortunately, is forever bound to eternalist paradigms.

I offer you a paradox of change, that eventually being tolerant to changing your paradigms will often eventually spiral into a paradigm that is unwilling/unable/against change. You eventually settle into a crystal, "set in your ways," eternalist perspective more and more.

<<<
 I mostly avoid the word “meaning,” because it builds in the assumption that something meaningful has one specific meaning. 
<<<

That seems like a bad argument.

<<<
I use “meaningness” in three closely-related ways, referring to:

   # the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless
   # the study of, or ideas about, this quality
   # a particular stance toward the quality: the one that acknowledges both meaninglessness and meaningfulness, avoiding both fixation and denial.

<<<

Define //quality// please. I think you are smuggling very //meaningful// content into it. I think you're trying to have your cake and eat it too here. I suggest that "quality" just is a type of meaning. Again, I think you must agree that being able to study or understand the idea of this quality just is to say it has a meaning. Are you going to infinigress into meanginesses of meaningnesses? Are you still going to hold that your point of view is correct in all cases? Do you really take yourself to be escaping eternalism, especially the univeralist and absoluteness,  completely? 

Look, introducing randomness, particularities and contexts, and contingency into this mix is hard work. Seeing how the necessary and contingent fit together is very hard from top to bottom. Your claims are incredibly sweeping, in my view.

<<<
I invented the word “meaningness” because the topic of this book seemed to have no name. There seems to be no -ology or -osophy devoted to it.
<<<

Truly an arrogant claim. 

First, the word "meaningness" was used in 1927 by Irvin Cobb in //Ladies and Gentlemen//. I suggest that in at least the past millenium, roughly the etymological age of "meaning," the word "meaningness" has been used multiple times before you "invented" it (and I doubt about inventing as opposed to discovery in more cases than most). F-ness of meaning, that could been something which any number of ancient cultures may have expressed in their particular languages. 

It's amazing that you don't think there is anything devoted to it. Your ideas are no accidents. I see the memeplex markings all over your language. I know the history of these memes. You're wrong. The notions you are talking about are not new. You are wrestling with something at the very core of //The Great Human Conversation//, at the core of philosophy from the beginning. 

You are insanely arrogant to believe that. 

Now you better deliver. So far, I think I'm shredding you a new one. I took you to be speaking from a lay-person's post-modern continental point of view. Okay, let me extra charitable: 

* I think you are wrong about these literal sentences.
* You may be absurdly exaggerating or lying. Maybe you know it's not the truth. 
* Let see if you prove me wrong.

<<<
My approach in this book is non-religious and non-philosophical. It is meant for readers who have rejected religious answers. Those who have figured out that philosophy also lacks answers may be even more intrigued.
<<<

Ruh-roh, yogi. Someone doesn't know what counts as philosophy. He's clearly convinced he has something special.

<<<
Less obviously, the book is also non-philosophical, and perhaps even anti-philosophical. It is meant as a practical manual.
<<<

It's a very bad sign when you don't realize what you are actually doing at this level. That you don't see how practical philosophy can be while espousing your point of view doesn't bode well.

<<<
Isn’t it odd that philosophy has no branch devoted to meaningness? Especially since meaningness is exactly what regular people, who haven’t studied philosophy, usually think philosophy is about? 
<<<

Strawman, and you are revealing your ignorance and lack of humility here (and that's ME saying it...arrogant asshole extraordinaire).

<<<
Nowadays, big questions are considered embarrassingly naive. The proper job of a philosopher is to make tiny technical corrections in esoteric theories that probably have no connection with reality.
<<<

Ah, you have confused academia with the actual discipline itself. I could go on and on about this topic. It's not relevant though. And, if you are paying attention, I think a non-trivial number of academic philosophers are attempting to construct something (even if they do so very poorly in many respects). It's also odd to see you talk about esoteric theories, when that's exactly what you've got on your hands here. I'm fine walking it down, are you?

<<<
In recent philosophical history, existentialism was an exception. It was willing to ask the important questions. It avoided the error of eternalism, by rejecting definite, objective meanings. However, it wrongly supposed that meaningness is merely subjective, and thereby came to an acknowledged nihilistic dead end.
<<<

Sweeping generalization, friend. Existentialism deserves our attention, no doubt. It does bring exceptional thinking to the table, but it is not the exception. I fear you know very little about the history of philosophy (and I say that know how little I know). You are generally correct though about part of this problem. Postmodernism is deconstructive to the point that it is unclear if it can construct anything, including the meaning we crave. Of course, at this point, I stand on one side of the fence: I do think there are objective meanings. You have uphill battle to fight with me now. You've not demonstrated you understand the issues, context, or the opposing views well enough.

<<<
Particular branches of current philosophy address particular dimensions of meaningness. For instance, normative moral philosophy tries to answer some questions about ethics—one dimension of meaningness.
<<<

Ah, so you were being quotably hyperbolic before. Hyperbole is easy. Being exact the first time is not.
