title: 2019.07.20 - Prompted Introspection: Best Decision

!! What is the best decision you have ever made in your life?

Getting married to my wife. EZ. I am not me without her, and I like that part of me. I don't know how I would have survived alone. She keeps me sane and helps me see straight. I adore that she knows how to speak autistic so well. It's a crazy rare experience for me.
