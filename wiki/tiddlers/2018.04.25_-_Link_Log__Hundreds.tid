* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ
*** I thought they'd move this direction, but it seems they will not be changing their proof system either. I like what [[Outopos]] is trying to do.
** https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-many-genes-do-cells-need-maybe-almost-all-of-them-20180419/
*** I stupidly thought that we had mostly useless aspects to our genes. At this scale, it seems like that should have to be a mistake. It makes sense too.

*** Some excellent points, minus the anti-communism perspective.
** https://www.nickgrossman.is/2018/cryptonetworks-and-why-tokens-are-fundamental/
*** Tokens don't have to work like that. I think decentralized networks that have stood the test of time have not demonstrated this principle. [[Outopos]] would be a good counterexample if we got there.

** https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/reinventing-america/556856/
*** Disgusting. Do you hear the DNC and DCCC talking through this mouthpiece? That is a Democratic grab for power, and it is sweeping under the rug the crises we actually are in.
