Challenge accepted, nomad. Feel free to come talk with me (anonymously if you wish): https://philosopher.life/. 

We can have an open dialogue. I'm radically in favor of political free speech rights, even for my enemies; that doesn't give us the moral right to say just anything. You've not seen bravery like mine; I will vulnerably give you the advantage of who I am in our dialectic to boot. You ready to play Tit-For-Two-Tats with me? I'll charitably take you down the rabbithole if you wish.
