What is left-libertarianism:

Left-libertarianism is a big-tent term for anti-authoritarian politics with left-wing bents. This ranges from left-leaning classical liberals to libertarian socialists. In as general terms as possible, left-libertarians value the following:

    Individual liberty

    Freedom of movement

    Social justice

    Self-ownership

    Government transparency

    Free sharing of knowledge

    Free trade

    Economic Freedom

Left-libertarianism is as much a political ideology as it is a cultural and social view. Left-libertarians tend to strongly identify with things such as the Free Software Movement, open source technology, squatting, direct democracy, D.I.Y ethics, punk music, and pirate radio.

Generally speaking, this sub is going to try and be as inclusive as possible, and serve as a hub for anybody who fits those general values. Left-libertarianism is inherently syncretic, and as such, left-libertarians need to be open to a wide range of views and beliefs. As long as your voice is positive, you're contributing to the conversation in a fair manner, and you're generally treating people well, you will fit in within this community.

I value or identify with most of your lists. Perhaps you should add some variant of free speech ("free sharing of knowledge" is likely too narrow) to it, since it seems to fit, and it may be one of the defining features of such an ethos, differentiating it from other Leftist positions.

That said, please forgive my ignorance: I'm trying to understand Left-libertarianism. To me, it's almost a contradiction. When I think of quintessential Libertarians, I think of John Locke and Robert Nozick. I think of a system with little space between its moral and legal norms based upon (poorly explained) self-ownership, a labor mixing theory for acquiring unowned objects, consent-based transfer of ownership of property to other self-owners, and minimal states (instead of a raw State of Nature) designed exclusively to protect these properties rights.

Strictly following that Libertarian notion, to say I own myself means to say that a 4-year old girl drowning in the pool next to me has neither a legal nor moral claim right on my body to save her. To say I have a duty to save the girl is to say the girl has a moral claim-right on my person (even if only temporarily). But, that violates my Libertarian self-ownership, right? If moral constraints override the Libertarian principles, what is that moral theory? Once you provide that theory, you'll find self-ownership is a much more complex and far weaker claim than Libertarianism implies. In fact, you'll find that Libertarian principles aren't the primary moral and political laws at all.

I think of the Left as being opposed to the Rand-Locke memeplex and Capitalism (which isn't to say we don't want markets at all), which is a big tent. There are clearly elements of decentralizing power in your lists (which is what I take the Left to be all about: opposition to the centralization of power). What about "the workers own the means of production" language?

All else being equal, everyone wants to maximize "Individual Liberty." To say you value that is almost vacuously true. Everyone does, even though they may define "individual" or "liberty" wildly differently. The "values" list has many of those kinds of problems. I want to see the moral theory which defines, explains, and justifies those political values. I'm not convinced Paine can do this for you.

It is likely the case I've misunderstood your point of view. Help me understand it better, please.
