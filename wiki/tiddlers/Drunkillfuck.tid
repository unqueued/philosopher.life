title: Drunkillfuck

//This was a dark time in my life. I think most people would not keep this. But, I want to remember it. Sometimes alcohol was the only option I had.//

```
This sentence, and everything which follows, is the result of being crazy drunk. On the verge (or
beyond) of puking drunk. Godspeed, faggot.

Please, God, End my life.
I don’t want any more pain.
Please end my life, painlessly.
Wouldn’t that be fair?
I’m not asking for anything more than breaking even.
End my life, with no more pain.
Please.
I’ve suffered enough.

It is all pointless.
This is all pointless.
This is absurd.
Fuck you.
Fuck me.
Who cares?

Hug it out.
Like men.
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit.
Nobody really loves anyone but themselves.

How can a person simultaneously have such a kaleidoscope of feelings?
Wrath, anguish, farcical humor, etc.
It’s not rational.
My feelings aren’t rational.
Sadly, what’s rational leads to my feelings.
This was pointless.

I have no reason to trust.
I trust k0sh3k.
I have no reason to trust her, but I do.
k0sh3k, I trust you, without reason for it.
That is part of love.

What is love?
Fuck everyone who doesn’t care about the answer or mocks attempts.
It’s an important, valuable, and epic question.
What is love?
I don’t know.

Do I know it when I see it?
Probably not.
I hope so.

Anonymous. Private.
Create. Think. Be.
I should relate.
I can’t.
There are many modes of “can.”

Poetry.
Wtf is it?
Let’s just be honest and brief.
Express what is difficult to express because you really need to express it.

The ideal epistemic agent’s experience is to be coveted.
We aren’t ideal.
Why should we care about each other’s experiences, points of view, etc.?
I don’t covet you, and you don’t covet me.
But, we don’t really even respect each other, either.
So?

Just create, h0p3.
Do something; be something; try something.
Maybe there is hope.
Hope for hope via creation.

It’s fascinating that my drunk and high notes seem elevated to my academic work.
But, life is life, and mental work is mental work.
Is it crazy to think that my phenomenal experience while high or drunk is as relevant or
important my experience while being soberly academic?
High and drunk me doesn’t think so.
What about sober me?

I am a man of defects.
I am a sinner.
I feel useless, bad, lacking merit, and being unworthy of existence.
Singer is right.
=(

Now I don’t want to end my life.

But, I am a bag of bones.
We are bags of chemicals.
We have no purpose, no telos.
ROFLMAOBBQSAWCE.
So what if I die?

Ah, you have no objective reason?
Me neither.
Forget it.

The name of this document is Drunkillfuck.
I am an angry man.
Injustice obtains.
Our state of affairs, frankly, blows.
I have a right to be angry.

What makes your thoughts better than mine?
What makes your feelings more viable, relevant, or correct?
I doubt it.
I honestly think I’m smarter than you, than I know more than you, that I’ve been exposed to
more than you, and so on.
I don’t think you are in an epistemic position to question me effectively.
Sadly, I don’t think we can relate either. =(

I love you.
Because, I’m stupid.
God, help me be stupid and happy at the same time.
Forever.
Please.

I want to be honest.
A man of integrity.
Moral.
Righteous.
Reason splinters me.
Reason gives me reason to be many things.
Reason gives me reason to be dishonest and honest.
Reason is unreasonable.
What or who can I trust to be honest?
I want to be myself again.
With certainty, I can no long be my previous self though.
I cannot be a man living from certainty.
Surd.

I hate you, h0p3.
I hate everything about you.
I hate everything, it seems.
That’s not true.
I love that part of k0sh3k.
I love that part of j3d1h and 1uxb0x.
Maybe that is enough to motivate living a life.

Surd.
Ha!
Ah, ha!
Everything follows from surd.
What do you wish?
I wish to have a sensible, practical, reasonable moral life back.
Surd elim.
Voila!
It still feels false. Fake. Absurd.
God.
Madness.

Fuck me.
I want to die.
Please.
Make this the end.
Please.
Am I talking to You, God?
Are You there?

What’s the point?
Am I supposed to make my own?
Frankly, fuck you, Frankl, neo-Kantians, etc.
Don’t you see the flaw in constructivism and “constitutivism?”
That’s just not what real objectivity is like.
Eat a dick (or pussy, whatever is least appealing to you), please.
So, What’s the point?

Selfishness is holding yourself above or beyond the moral law.
Selfishness is thinking you are the exception when you aren’t.
But, some people are the exception, right?
Particularism.
Boom.
Fuck.

Golden standard or scaling/relative standard?
Pragmatically, the scaling.
But, the cost is high.
The cost is also a form of skepticism.
It’s like I’m seeking the least skeptical position.
Skepticism being idealism with disappoint (dank memes, son I am).
I want to maintain idealism while minimizing my disappointment.
How selfish.

Denial & Isolation; Anger; Bargaining; Depression.
I would adore some Acceptance.
I would even take irrational Acceptance even.
I can’t do it though.

Human function is thought, philosophy, ethical & political life.
That might be right.
Ouch.
That sucks.
I’d prefer to deny a telos, sometimes.

There are many “fucks” given in these “poems.”
Versatile or demonstrating inarticulacy, idk.
I need the word.
It’s almost syntactically necessary at this point.
I need that shortcut.

I regret and am further saddened by my inability and/or forced isolation from my family.
We cannot connect.
I cannot understand them.
They cannot understand me.
That’s sad.

I hate that k0sh3k can’t be open with me about her religious experience.
I hate to say, I think I am smarter.
I am more learned.
But, she has different experiences and evidence.
Disagreement is complex.
I wish her luck.
Let me die.

Drunk. Kill. Fuck.
Yeah, that title sums it up.
Experience, need, desire, feeling, anger….everything.
Lol.

Why write this?
This is about therapy, or hope, or an attempt to digest.
This is just a desire to live.
This is selfish.
This is pointless.
You deserve nothing less than death.

I am alone.
Every creature dies alone.
Yeah, “every” doesn’t mean you aren’t still alone. Dipshit.

Miss no opportunity.
Be a Jew of utility.
Ha. That’s stupid.

What things am I not skeptical about, while also being rational about?
I don’t know.
Stuff. I’m sure.

Do you hate me God? *assuming you exist
I hate me.
I don’t know if I hate You.
I want to.
Only a drunken fool writes these things.
I am no better, and no one else is either.
Lol; pointless.

I assume what makes good poetry is whatever makes the general group of people who claim to
like poetry become happy by reading whatever you’ve written.
This isn’t poetry, as I’m sure my wife would love to point out
It is though.
I’m far from convinced anyone else’s experience supersedes my own.

I want the world to end.
Let it end.
Nothing deserves to live or exist.

I wish I could just enjoy the contradictions and absurdities.
What a wonderful life that would be, right?

Beware, dipshits, suicide might be rational.
Go ahead and rationally walk me through why it isn’t.
You will be disappointed.

Pressure, stress, and force.
I welcome what is due.
I despise what isn’t.
I enjoy challenge.
I do not enjoy being tasked with the impossible.
I request fairness.
Don’t tell me to “grow up,” dipshit.
You probably don’t even comprehend the problem.

Diametrically opposed ideas.
I want to live, and I want to die.
Lol. Almost Farce.
I don’t know if it is farce.
Farce implies certain moral requirements that I can’t posit.
I still have no answer or weighing tool.
Coin flip, mo’fucka’.

Can you make a life of the pointless?
Of games, narratives, music, and art.
Vision of the aesthetic sans ethics.
I hope.

Until now, there are 6 hopes in my poetry.
8 hates.
8 loves.
5 Gods.
And, 10 fucks.
Lol (4 including this one).

End.
Telos, Finish, Goal.
Please, may death be mine.

I see why k0sh3k finds poetry to be so emotional and personal.
It’s honest and lonely.
It’s brutal.
This is really only for me.
It’s not satisfying.
Why would I do this for/to myself?
Drinking + Poetry puts me in an objective-feeling mode which enables me to bleed quietly.

Whole Foods customers are a great example of people with more money than sense.
It drives me crazy that people who are dumber than me have more money than me.
I probably don’t know what counts as justice anyways.

I am in pain.
Justice does not obtain, not even close.
People suck.
I’m wildly smarter than everyone else, but we’re all fucking ignorant.
People are selfish. They aren’t ashamed of it either.
I resent people.
I despise them.
Why should I have to be moral? (Oh, because that’s just what moral reasons are?...lol)
Fuck that.
Tell me why morality isn’t just Kool-Aid.
Why are we anything more than organic sacs of chemicals and electrical signals?
Show me why we aren’t reducible.
You aren’t special, and neither am I.

I cannot sleep.
I need it.
Sleep is soothing.
Where is my sleep with reckless abandon?
Where is my comfort and safety?
Where is my happiness?
Damn right I am entitled to happiness.
At least entitled to some sleep.

If I survive this, will I have scars?
What will they be?
I’d take scars if it was worth it in the end.
Will it be worth it?
As usual, I don’t know.

Arrogance is the attitude of thinking you are better than you actually are.

It’s a vice.
On the other end of the spectrum is also a vice: humility.
Admit your limits.
Be virtuous.

I wish a personal version of you existed, God.
Fuck that guy.
I’d love to give that Faggot a piece of my mind.
Alas, you aren’t that.
You are benign and useless IRL.
Thank God?
Lol.
Funny enough, the issue of God isn’t a big one for me.
I wish it were.
I really need someone to blame.
There’s no one to blame.
It all just sucks, and it isn’t anyone’s fault.
After all, we are faultless.

“Suicide is a form of avoidance”
No shit, Sherlock.
That doesn’t mean it’s incorrect.
Infer better, please.

I grasp my rod.
I stroke my staff.
I comfort me.

Psychostruggle.
Lose it.
How do I come back?

Counselor.
You fail.
You do not understand.
You not only can’t absolve, but you can’t even comprehend.
You cannot mend or help.
Are you really a counselor?

Beer is odd.
It’s a different drug.
It puts me in a different state of mind.

I’m not sure where.

Anti-depressants make me less angry.
I’m incredibly grateful.
I appreciate the ability to cope and relate to my children more effectively.
I am more patient.
I have a long-fuse.
I am more understanding.
I am glad.

We are mere monkeys.
We are chemicals and electrical signals.
We are atoms.
We are reducible.
Who cares about us?
There is nothing but atoms (or whatever is philosophically, ontologically atomic).
All is pointless.

My poems are unorganized.
Genus, species, individual substance, organ system, organ, tissue, molecule, atom, fail.
Forget it.
Sounds like a horrible philosopher rockband song.
Please kill yourself.
It may be best to try not to care in the first place.

It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
What a show!?!
I relate and don’t.
I agree and don’t.
It’s insane and correct.
The show is paradoxical.

My parents seem to care and love.
Do they?
They cannot be happy for me, or understand, or approve.
They cannot reconsider, or be charitable, or put themselves in my shoes.
Empathy is hard.
I forgive them.

Collective agency.
That’s hilarious.
So intuitive, but obviously false and reducible.

Death.
I seek it, but I don’t want to cause it upon myself.
These meds take away my desire to act.
But, I am worthless.
That fact remains.

Flush me.
Please, end me.
Who are you, Ender?
Is this a Game, Ender?

What do I fear?
Pain.
That sucks. That’s not enough. You are a bad person for only fearing pain.
Immorality.
Ah, but, shit…after a lot of thought…that’s a mirage.
So…

Boobs partake of the Good.
So much chemical, irrational pleeeeee-aay-zure (according to my UoPitts. Epist. Prof.)
Yeah, I love boobs.
Maybe I could live for them, I hope?

Who am I talking to?
I imagine God, or some objective person judging.
Help me, please.

My chest hurts.
It pulses and pangs.
Stress, hate, sadness, and something.
My mind, “spirit,” and body all seek the END!
Telos or death, please give me.

You’re a stupid piece of shit.
Psh, psh, psh, psh.
L.
O.
L.
Fucktard.

There is no mystery.
All that was stable is fishy and objectionable.
No certainty, confidence, or hope.
Doubt is all that remains.
Be certain in doubt.
Ugh.

My face is beyond numb.
I want to hurt it.
I wish I could allow myself.
But, no. I shouldn’t, and thus can’t.
But, god damn, I want to!

I like writing poems.
I like writing my highdeas.
I enjoy it.
Shit, dude: Pleasure is pleasure.
It isn’t hurting anyone significantly or at all (I’ll entertain many conceptions of hurt).
Do it.

Drunk me seeks happiness.
God, I suck.
Happiness and morality are constantly in tension.
We are marred, as Hursthouse says (but far more than she realizes).
We suck.

I like the honesty and brutality of inebriation.
I feel unfiltered.
I feel like me.
I fucking hate everyone, including myself.
Forget(I.poem_object)

I hate everyone, including me, and whatever “God” may exist.
But!, I don’t want to hate.
I want to love and be happy.
Reason does not lead me to happiness, but rather and mainly anger and sadness.

Postmodernism.
God damn, I’m in it.
In it to win it!....uh…lol…fuck…=(

Cannot kill myself, can I.
Yoda, fucktard is he.
Me, I am also: fucktarded.
Fucktards don’t deserve life.
Why can’t I end my life?

Anti-depressants barely work.
Well, don’t drink and take meds, idiot.
--Well, Life just isn’t that simple, asshole.
Just take it; just try.
GL.

What’s important to me?
Family, morality, happiness, truth, sex, computers, pleasure, etc.
Nothing is important, but surd-elim buys me everything I want.
Just do it, be you, relax, screw it all.

Mercy-cunt.
Hate-fuck.
Relax.

Just don’t care.
I need motivation.
Nothing is valuable or worthy.

My depression is an oscillation between high and low thoughts.
Value and nothing.
Reason and nothing.
Love and hate.
Depressions sucks.

It’s weird that your dad is bi, without telling anyone.
At least, kinda’, right?
Maybe. His right to omit it, I suppose.
Forget it.

Strong words:
Abomination. Love. I. Balance.

I HAVE FAILED EVERYONE.
I AM A FAILURE.
Fuck me.
Please, end my life.

Ass, Bitch, Cunt, Damn, Fuck, Shit
Kike, Nigger, Sand-Nigger
Boob, Hell
Retard
Words and people (of all social conditions) suck.

Boobs are amazing.
They feel amazing and taste like heaven.
Boob make me dance and vibrate.
I want to fuck them.
I need to suck them.
I must view them.
I love boobs.

Asses are dirty and delicious.
I like banging my sweet spot with a prostate stimulator.
Hairy butts are gross (mine is gross).
My wife’s ass is fantastic.
Shit, female asses give me whiplash.
Fuck ALL the bitches’ asses.

Mushrooms.
Fleshy, spore-bearing fungi.
Delicate, random and yet precise.
Complex and difficult to grow.
They are detailed forms of life.
90% water? Damn.
That last 10% must be potent.
I’m excited to try.

My dissertation is pointless.
I don’t care.
I have no desire to convince anyone.
Why defend or promote anything?
This is useless.
Some of time has been wasted.

Everyone seeks happiness.
Do not delude yourself into thinking happiness is something greater than pleasure.
Eudaimonia only speaks to the complexity of pleasure-seeking.
Virtue really is aimed at selfishness.
Jesus. H. Christ.
Egoism.

Went from Bronze to Gold in my 1st season of League.
I’m actually pleased.
I really suck at that game, and I’m glad to have improved.
Improving isn’t easy.
I’m not use to that genre.
Gold is a good start.

Clitorati.
