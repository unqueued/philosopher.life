title: Introducing Aesthetics: A Graphic Guide

I'm an unrepentant whore in church. I've always been opposed to unchecked Romanticism.

What does it mean to value art for itself alone and not for any purpose or function? I'm sure that sounds completely obvious to most people. But, I'm not most people: I'm a true asshole. The admiration of [[Beauty]], particularly produced through techne, appears to be reducible to a hedonic function. I agree that pleasure is necessary for eudaimonia, but art obviously serves a purpose (and it should).

<<<
Philosophers are not yet prepared to let go of a controlling subject because their ideas are still shaped by capitalist ideology.
<<<

Roflmao. That sounds like an attempt at philosophy to me. Sounds like a pretense for anti-realism, and it's hard to point to anything which isn't shaped by capitalism. But, yes, I grant the claim that we are infected.

Art is rhetoric; it's primarily about your emotions, wherein reason is mostly a conduit. The emotivists (and their kin) come out to argue that reason is the slave of the passions, inert, missing the point, secondary, parasitic, evil, or generally meaningless; it's just subjective pointing and there's no objective point, no meaningful propositions. Our emotions have evolved long before our conscious reasoning. Sounds like a solid egoistic and even sociopathic point of view. Of course, I do not know how to balance that [[self-dialectic]] between the limbic system and the neocortex.

<<<
The only excuse for making something useless is that one admires it intensely. All art is useless.
<<<

You aren't going to be able to peel [[The Beautiful]] apart from the [[The Right]], especially not while engaging in rational dialectics. You do not get to state art as being useful for admiration and then call it useless at the same time. Note, of course, [[The Right]] objectively merits admiration by definition. I suggest [[The Beautiful]] merits admiration from a more subjective point of view, but it appears [[The Objective]] is dialectically comprised of objective aesthetics as well.

Art is not above the fray, it is not outside the dialectic, and you need an argument for why it isn't telic. First, however, you have to deliver a theory of teleology. You're boned. You don't get to help yourself to words like "useless" without being accountable to them.

<<<
So, while aesthetics began as a specialist branch of philosophy, it was actually in the right position to form the kernel for nearly all future philosophical inquiry.
<<<

Hubris. My God, I love it. Let me grant that it always been a part of the kernel!

It is hilarious that Saint Plato banned standardly conceived artists from The Republic. Yeah, he's wrong, but this is a fucking strawman of Plato. [[JHBFC]], he's fighting against emotional manipulation (which isn't to say he's correct), particularly abuses of religion as a memetic apparatus over discourse. Reason is the only thing we each can verify; it occupies a fundamental role. The author is reading the man out of context.

Mimetics play on emotions, and combating sophistry is fundamentally our duty (however painful it may be). On the virtue spectrum, we tend to be viciously emotional creatures; thus, overshoot the mean (don't worry, our emotions will drag us back).

It's crucial to see that even our experiences of the immanent are poor copies of The Forms, and hence simulacrum is a problem not just for art. The Platonists I know have much stronger points of view than is presented here.

<<<
In this context, the Other designates not simply an idea of divergency, but of an absolute difference that is by definition unknowable and, therefore, unrepresentable.

Any relation with the other is also, by implication, unrepresentable, leaving no room for a controlling subject.
<<<

It would be useful for them to define "subject" since they weasel a great deal into it (perhaps even as boogeyman). This is an ancient topic, as the author points out. I don't know why they didn't begin with ancient perspectives on the subject. Saint Aristotle usually has something valuable to start us off with.

I am interested in this problem. Do we simply deduce there is something transcendent but humbly refrain from saying or validating any experience of it given the initial definition? What say you, Saint Kant? What does it mean to speculate into and about the noumena? You appear to help yourself in some forms of transcendental deductions, homie. Cave, sun, and noumena may still be the wrong metaphors in the end, but I have no other (ha) way to talk about that Otherness.

Absolute difference cannot be correct. They must share something in common, even if it is only a commensurability for even one of them to perceive a semblance of the other, even if only mediated through probabilistic and simulated mediums. The object is revealed, uncovered, discovered (maybe sometimes recovered) to the subject. The object, to some extent, must inhere in the subject for perception to occur. I feel like I'm virtualizing Aristotle's sense-organ theory now. 

When I think of absolute difference, I'm in Hegelian territory. I'm thinking of dialectical opposition, and yet even these things are sublated. Their "isness" alone, their conceivability via higher-ordered minds, their processability via higher-ordered objects, are a form of sameness and relatability. To call something //absolutely different// is definitionally inconceivable, unfortunately, [[ITS]]. I'm not even sure it makes sense to talk about absolute difference since the words themselves point to the concepts which point to the objects of which I surely, by definition, cannot be the subject. 

Idealism and Kantian skepticism pose a problem here. Do you really, really mean to say you never inch closer to the thing-in-itself? Yes, it requires faith, but to deny that faith is going to mean there is nothing you experience which is real. We may even have a Xenoic kind of problem of reaching and attending to our own observed experience, but I'm sure many phenomenologists would deny this. 

What does it mean for the transcendent to become immanent to us? It is equivalent to problem of knowledge in general. What does it mean to come to know what you don't know? I don't know all the way down, but I know some of it. Perhaps there is some moral luck to where we place our tentpegs. 

To say the other is unrepresentable is itself a representation. Truly, you can't truthfully say you have the truth of there being no truth. To claim all is absurd allows one to surdElim that not all is absurd. Relativity leads to intolerance in the paradox as well.

---

That is not my understanding of Hegel, but the author gave a reasonable rundown of Kant. There's a disconnect here.

---

I suggest the author is [[Straussian]] about Nietzsche, offering the absurdly rosey account of anti-realism and the claim of misappropriation by Nazis. The author appears to think to deny the logical possibility of "maintaining and defining a subject in relation to what is unknown (the other)...since the unknown provides no point of comparison or frame of reference." What the fuck do you think you are referring to in that sentence? 

I can agree Nietzsche is attempting to deny fixed representations, metaphysics, opposition between truth and falsity, and [[The Dialectic]]. 

<<<
"Beauty" in Nietzsche's revised terms signalled the collapse of all conceptually and morally determined oppositions..."Beauty" exists outside all orders of rank, because in beauty opposite are tamed, moreover without tension. That violence is no longer needed, that everything follows, obeys, so easily and so pleasantly - that is what delights the artist's will to power.
<<<

Ah, there we go. Nietzsche thinks [[The Beautiful]] is the ultimate sublator. It's the only [[Good]] to him. He thinks he has risen above [[The Right]] so as to make it an illusion. He correctly predicted a catastrophe in [[The Great Human Conversation]] when people decided god is dead, but he is the exemplar of the catastrophe. 

I appreciate that he embraces change and art. He has already failed Plato's test to think [[Beauty]] isn't eternal and objective. I'm sure he's proud of his arrogance (me too!).

---

Walter Benjamin's Aura critique is right on the money. Capitalism commodifies everything, including dissent, insidiously preventing a critique of itself (even via critiques). I am worried about my own wiki having this problem. I think making it free (not merely as in beer, though sometimes as in kittens) prevents it from having elements of that aura. There's no mystical aspect which increases its value. If you didn't pay for it, you don't confabulate a belief about its value either, which is part of how that aura seems to work.

Well, I'm not surprised too much, but I am not bored. Excellent read.
