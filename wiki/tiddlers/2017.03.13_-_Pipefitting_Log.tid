title: 2017.03.13 - Pipefitting Log

I woke up late because I forgot to set my alarm clock for daylight savings time yesterday. That's okay. Nobody was required to come to class today. In fact, I was the only student to show up to the entire school today. I didn't get much done, admittedly.

My teacher wasn't there when I arrived, so I couldn't get in the tool room. I raided the welding shop for some rods, and I found some very thick hot burning rods (gaaaaaayyyyy, um...yum?). Anyways, none of my welds looked good with it. There was a ton of spatter. I tried many different heat settings. I think I just got lucky with the rods I've been using. There is clearly much to learn. 

I didn't cut my ring correctly, so that project died. Ha. 

I decided not to weld my extremely thick flat plates because they took so long to bevel. I wanted to practice my roots on thinner plates first. This was a good call. I beveled plates quickly, and I tacked the plates too close together (I did the same thing as last time). My teacher took me to the millwright shop to grab the thick wire we needed to get the appropriate distance. I cut the tacks and got the right width. I welded these plates together. I went too slowly, letting it build up far too much (no need for filler, it was that bad). My root was...not worse than last time, but not acceptable. I didn't penetrate the edges on the bottom well enough, and it wasn't very even. This is definitely a practice problem. Most importantly, I was slightly off on my angle and not nearly deep enough. I will have a better angle, be absolutely at the root, and move more quickly. My teacher told me to try different passing styles too. I was going back and forth on the keyhole. Next time, I will try circles.

Also, my teacher told me a way to practice at home. I can use a vice grip and a pencil, and I can draw the lightest most consistent circular (or otherwise) patterns possible like that. I will practice at home. 

I didn't want to waste my plates and continue going through new ones. I asked how we could reuse what I had. We couldn't cut them with saws since they are quite long. So, my teacher taught me to cut them with the torch!

So, I learned how to use the acetylene cutting torch today. It was awesome. I just want to write down the procedure here to make sure I don't forget. I may not get much practice with it, so I want a mental checklist. 

* Have the material to be cut clamped and in a safe position. I put an aluminum plate on the ground as well. Having someone to catch the piece your cutting is also damn useful. Be safe!
* Move it into a safe position.
* Make sure there is no oil anywhere on the lines, gauges, connectors, etc. Never use Teflon tape either. It will explode.
* Make sure the headpiece is cleaned. 
* The right gauge shows total tank pressure (how much is in the tank), while the left gauge shows the pressure in the hose.
* Stay away from the pressure release valve handles while turning the gases on.
* Turn the oxygen all the way on. It should go to around 40 pounds. 
* Turn the acetylene on with a quarter turn (make it easy to turn off) to around 8-10 pounds. Never go to 15 or more, that is dangerous.
* Put your shaded glasses on. I want to wear a face shield for it too. That shit flies and it's crazy hot.
* Have your igniter ready and torch in hand. Turn the oxygen knob (at the bottom of the torch, the upside) and light it. 
* Set the oxygen correctly by turn it up until the flame has a small half centimeter disconnect from the head, then turn it down until it connects (maybe a hair past it). 
* Turn the acetylene on, and keep it going up until the blue moves all the way to the head. Then pull the trigger and make sure there is still no bluer. Keep turning it up until the blue hits the head while the trigger is on.
* Make sure you are comfortable (an armrest is nice, use a stand or block of wood).
* WIthout the trigger, get to your starting edge and get it cherry red hot. 
* Pull the trigger, keep about a centimeterish distance and move at a good speed.
* You can pull off and restart but restart at a place where it doesn't matter.
* Be careful about slag. The goal is to cut while minimizing slag. Going too fast or too slow allows for slag buildup if I understand correctly.

When you are done:

* Turn off oxygen, then acetylene on the torch. 
* Turn off oxygen and acetylene on the container valves.
* Empty the oxygen in the lines with the trigger.
* Empty the acetylene in the lines with the torch knobs (and close it back again).

Having a cutting torch to use will be useful. I'm going to cut my next ring with it. 

My teacher and I shot the shit for a while. I heard there may be a 20-year job coming to Knoxville that our union might be getting. That would be sweet. In any case, despite the fact that there are long-term reasons to want to go to Chattanooga, I would much rather live in KY with the rest of my family anyways. My teacher said that either way is great. He thinks it would be really hard to turn down coming in as a 2nd or 3rd-year apprentice before I even finished this program since that is simply unheard of. It would be sick money, and we desperately need it. We are taking a huge risk, and I want to mitigate that as much as possible. 

My teacher says he doesn't blame me one bit for turning down the Eastman job. He thinks it was the right move.

I won't be going to Chattanooga tomorrow. I want my shop time. I can go Thursday. I really do need to visit though. Chattanooga is probably plan B at this point, but I need to make sure I have that plan B.
