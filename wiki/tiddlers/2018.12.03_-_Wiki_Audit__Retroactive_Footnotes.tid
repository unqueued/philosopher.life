title: 2018.12.03 - Wiki Audit: Retroactive Footnotes

I am loving the dated footnotes. First, I consider it an accountability mechanism + reward. It's awesome to prove to myself that I am thinking about who I was. {[[Vault]]} seems to come alive here.

I am obviously hesitant to change my historiography. Syntax is fine, but semantics is another issue. I still do not have an outstanding policy on how to update semantics and maintain the integrity of my past intention. I have no idea how to write those rules. 

Post facto footnotes allow me to speak with reference and in context. It's digestion and dot connecting. I love that I care about my own story. I hope these retroactive [[Footnotes]] snowball over the decades.

Also, the convention for multiple retroactive footnotes will be "YYYY.MM.DD-X" where is the standard footnote (I'm just numbering at this point).

Github-pages is throwing up an error again. =/ I really don't think it's my end either.

---

Modified $:/language/RecentChanges/DateFormat again to add █ to the ends. It pops now. =)

I forgot to mention I added ⦗ and ⦘ back into the wiki, but only for the title. I still don't know what to do about the versioning subtitle. I'm considering taking it out, but I think it celebrates [[Wiki Audit]] and {[[Vault]]}. I'll leave it for now.

Whoops, forgot [[2018.11 - Computer Musings]] for [[Monthly Auditable]]. Auditing the audit now.

---

I was reminded to make old voldy prettier. It has long looked like a dump (because it was just a dump).

I want to point out that 5.1.18 was supposed to be released today. They have no serious testing suite. I cannot afford to be an early adopter here; my work is not able to accept beta testing (beyond what it already is). I'm going to wait at least two weeks. I've never carefully examined a TW release cycle, and this will be my opportunity to think about it. I'm super tempted to jump on the train out of the gate. Lol. I haven't been this excited for the release of an update of any software in a long time.

I made it to 2017.09.04 in [[The Remodeling]]. I covered almost a month today. I'm proud.
