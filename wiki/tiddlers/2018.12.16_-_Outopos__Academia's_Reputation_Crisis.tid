title: 2018.12.16 - Outopos: Academia's Reputation Crisis

https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2017/03/academia-is-fucked-up-so-why-isnt.html

Ah, now this is an excellent example of where an automated [[T42T]] infrastructure with a filtering/trust/reputation software system built on top solves an obvious fundamental problem to me. Frankly, [[2018.03.30 - Outopos: Decentralized Reddit]] is trying to solve the same thing.

The fact is that where we calculate and store our individual preferences, opinions, and beliefs MUST reside with us, on our own machines! We must own the means of production in order for us to control of our minds and ability to communicate what's in our minds with others. Further, we must leverage our trust in each other in a decentralized manner; perhaps it is the best version of a byzantine corruption we can muster.

The blockchain fails because it aims to maintain lossless virtualized ledger, but most of our fundamental problems can be handled in a lossy, sharded, F2F, good-enough mesh manner. Furthermore, blockchain is retarded inefficient in its proof of work. Proof of work needs to actually fucking do something, from compute, to storage, to truth itself. [[T42T]] is obviously the answer; it's a proof of stake built on the proof of work given people agree to. It is, unfortunately, a market (but I cannot escape that in [[The Original Position]]).
