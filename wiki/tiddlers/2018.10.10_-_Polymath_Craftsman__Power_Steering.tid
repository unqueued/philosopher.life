title: 2018.10.10 - Polymath Craftsman: Power Steering

Vehicle is making a sound that makes me think power-steering ain't great. Fluid seems low but acceptable. Will add. This was recently checked. In the end, I don't need this vehicle if I'm not lugging tools around. Better to just fix the oldsmobile.
