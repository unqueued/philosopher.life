title: 2017.01.11 - Pipefitting Log

Much has transpired since my last log. I'm learning how little we (the students) know. Our teacher is very qualified in multiple fields, has a huge list of contacts, and a lot of experience in teaching. We talked for an hour or so. I think we will get along just fine. He can see I'm chomping at the bit, and I think he will help me get where I'm going. 

I have not yet finished all of my computer work, but I'm close. I'm finally doing some bookwork too. I aced the safety exam (the welders were vexed at the difficulty of our exam that the pipefitters take). I'm going to smash the math exam (I have to take a surprising number of these, despite already demonstrating my competency). I want to cruise through the "core" book which all tradesman must complete so that I can get onto the actual pipefitting. The teacher suggests I take electives as well, so I will. 

What I lack in practical construction experience I will make up for (at least in the beginning) with raw memory, computational skill, and intense practice. I need to build a good reputation (which, at this point, amounts to a form of manipulation that I find sufficiently morally acceptable by necessity). I'm looking for portions of the job that are worth memorizing; I do have a good memory when I'm not depressed (it used to be godly before puberty). I need to first understand where the real analysis and spatial reasoning occurs. My teacher explained that planning, measuring, and blueprint/modeling is what makes a successful pipefitter. I think these will fit me very nicely. 

Our first real shop experience (whenever it eventually comes) will be pipe threading. I've been reading through our first pipefitting book and looking through our blue books (everyday carry kind of manual for the field). Fellow students have walked me through it as well. I'm excited to try my hand. 

I spoke with a 3rd-party institution which helps fund students who need it. I do, and I have a lady who has really gone to bat for me (despite the fact that I have 10 years of postsecondary education, which is normally grounds for denial of help). She is my advocate. We've gone through testing and a lot of paperwork (and apparently she had to argue with her boss), but I think there is a reasonable chance that my second and third trimester's tuition will be paid for, and I will get a bunch of tools, work clothes/glasses, books, and possibly travel expenses paid for. This is the break I need. I find out in the next two days if my application is accepted at the state level. If not, my lady says she'll appeal the decision. She gets my predicament.

The more I understand about pipefitting, the more I like it. I think this is an excellent path.
