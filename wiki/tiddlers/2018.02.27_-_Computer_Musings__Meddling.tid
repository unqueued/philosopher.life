m10-home-h0p3 is the backup of my home directory. I keep encrypted copies of it backed up in several places. I want to be able to reconstruct my home directory very quickly, and I never want to lose what matters most to me. I keep forgetting that resilio sync has the habit of archiving everything deleted for a long time. I need to stop that for this across the devices I use.

Trackers eventually see that I'm not seeding through shadowsocks (although it appears normal for days). So, I'm going to have to kill that route.
