title: 2018.05.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Say To Missed Relative

!! What would I say to them if I could see them again?<<ref "1">>

I'd tell them I love them. I gotta say, that's in part what this wiki is for. It is a method for me to communicate who I am to them, even if it has been a while since we've connected. In a way, "seeing" me isn't about perceiving my physical features, but includes perceiving what I take to be more essential features of my identity. That sort of thing is hard to communicate for everyone. Thus, this wiki can be used a tool of empathy in such cases, and a litmus/trust test otherwise.
