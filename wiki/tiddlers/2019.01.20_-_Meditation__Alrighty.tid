title: 2019.01.20 - Meditation: Alrighty

Tried several yoga poses. It has been quite a while for me. My minimal flexibility is as minimal as ever. My fatness makes it difficult. My Osgood-Schlatter makes anything on the knees killer. My strength and balance are there though.

I'm releasing the muscle groups. My chest and shoulders tend to be fairly tense, and even my eye-socket area is something I'm not good at releasing and leaving released. I continue to try to let go. My mind races, but (per my wife's instructions) I am not kicking myself for my failure. I'll get there, eh?

My choir-breathing exercises appear to be useful in this practice. I'm gonna keep focusing on the edge of it.
