title: 2018.08.28 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

I need to stop being annoyed by how fast we are moving. This is an excellent introduction. That doesn't make it right, and I should stop asking for it to be right. It's a good thing to wish they wrote 10,000 pages instead of 100.

I like they they try to point out Aristotle's empiricism in relation to other perspectives. I actually think Aristotle's view can be reductive. I'm not in love with their explanation of Plato's view in contrast. I should not be too picky. They aren't radically wrong or uncharitable; this is a matter of systematic interpretation and not having enough space.

I do like the realism, externalism, and attempts to defeat a number of [[infinigress]]ive problems explained here. They are capturing the difference in essentialness reasonably. Obviously, the relationship between the particulars and universals that I speak of are a result of this man. Thank you, ~~sir~~ Saint!
