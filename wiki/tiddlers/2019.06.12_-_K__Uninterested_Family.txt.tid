Have a wonderful day!
JUN 12 8:53 AM
I hope you have a wonderful day too! =)
JUN 12 9:41 AM
How are you doing?*
JUN 12 9:42 AM
I’m hanging in there. Feels like a bad mental health day honestly. Just gonna take it one hour at a time.
JUN 12 9:43 AM
How are you?
JUN 12 9:43 AM
I'm sorry. =/
JUN 12 9:44 AM
You feeling anxious, depressed, or something else?
JUN 12 9:47 AM
Yeah. Those things pretty much. And I’m just super tired.
JUN 12 9:56 AM
Actually that sounds more like depression lol
JUN 12 9:56 AM
That sucks.
JUN 12 10:00 AM
Yeah. Ill be okay though.
JUN 12 10:02 AM
They can be particularly insidious because they slowdown finding their own treatment.
JUN 12 10:02 AM
One hour at a time works.
JUN 12 10:02 AM
We're doing okay over here. Kids are working on their Clicker Heroes bots. I'm applying to more jobs. [[k0sh3k]]'s doing ILL.
JUN 12 10:03 AM
Poor [[k0sh3k]] :(
JUN 12 10:34 AM
Lol.
JUN 12 10:34 AM
She works hard.
JUN 12 10:35 AM
I'm usually previous envious. She loves her job; it's actually fulfilling to her.
JUN 12 10:35 AM
She might be applying to a job in Japan for funsies.
JUN 12 10:36 AM
She could probably figure out how to navigate that. I'm a dumb Gaijin though.
JUN 12 10:36 AM
Are you guys wanting to move?
JUN 12 10:41 AM
We're open to it.
JUN 12 10:44 AM
I'm having a hard time finding a job out here.
JUN 12 10:44 AM
[[k0sh3k]] gets paid below average for her position (and that won't be changing at this school).
JUN 12 10:44 AM
We moved out here to be closer to her family; she was raised in this area. It turns out that none of her family have an interest in having a significant relationship with her (or us).
JUN 12 10:45 AM
That’s super sucky. :(
