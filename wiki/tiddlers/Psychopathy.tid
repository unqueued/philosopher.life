title: Psychopathy

//Psychopathy, unfortunately, is highly adaptive, particularly in near-perfect competition.//

I use this word a lot. I have a technical meaning for it which comes my graduate work in moral psychology. 

Psychopathy is the "choice" to not empathize. A person, P, is psychopathic towards X to the extent that P chooses not to empathize with X.

This is an incredibly broad definition. You may have learned about psychopathy from a TV show or hearing stories about serial killers. Those aren't accurate depictions of the neurological and moral issues at play though. Here's a scary fact: we all sit on the dark-triad spectrum. We are all, to some degree, psychopathic.

Note that autism and psychopathy are distinct. Autistic people lack the gutteral, faster-acting abilities to develop standard theories of mind. It is an impairment or at least a deviance in the activations of their right temporoparietal junction that prevents them from developing theories of mind in the ways that neurotypical humans do. Autistic people, therefore, often lack empathy in cases where neurotypicals do. The reason for this lack of empathy, however, is due to lacking a fitting theory of mind. One's mirror neurons cannot fire off, one cannot feel the pain of another, if one doesn't at least understand how the other person is thinking (having accurate beliefs about what the target believes, infers, desires, feels, etc.). Essentially, it wasn't a choice for the autistic person (although, there are definitely cases where autistic people can be psychopathic). Psychopathy, however, is very much about choosing not to empathize; they are capable of empathizing (seriously), they just don't. 

I see two kinds of psychopathy, direct and indirect.

Direct:

Choosing not to empathize. It is literally a switch in a psychopath's mind. Those further along the spectrum may be born with it, others conditioned (and some a bit in between). This is exactly what makes a psychopath so excellent in social situations, at manipulating, at being so charming, etc. They have the empathy skills and at times the inhuman objectivity (we are aliens to them, the other) to develop deep theories of our minds, make good inferences about our reactions, and to use us. 

Lower IQ psychopaths tend to be level 1 in the Positive Disintegration scale because they systematically and consistently aren't intelligent enough to recognize the need to empathize with themselves at all. Being able to plan for the future, to not be impulsive, to employ their frontal lobes at the right time in the right way, stems from their inability to develop the right kinds of intuitions and practices for empathizing with themselves in their Fastmind. 

Higher IQ psychopaths are called sociopaths. They are so high-functioning that they literally blend in. They appear so normal to us. They are smart about their egoistic selfish pursuits. They empathize with themselves to their benefit and no one else's (although, they capable of empathizing with their family [among others]; it depends on the degree to which they are psychopathic). They have learned when and where to turn the empathy switch on and off. My grandfather is clearly a highly psychopathic sociopath. 

Indirect:

Choosing not to become the kind of person who empathizes. This is very much related to [[Indirect doxastic voluntarism]]. This is  where Hanlon's Razor is wrong (and Socrates is right). Willful ignorance of theories of mind and habituating psychopathic dispositions are the core causes of indirect psychopathy. 

Finally, I should point out that "choice" is concerned with freedom (which I'm not sure anyone actually has). The entire issue may be moot in a way. Moral responsibility could easily be an illusion (again, this is legit moral psychology).
