!! Audit:

* Like pulling teeth getting myself to write at all, especially letters.
* Maybe up 30% with offspring and down 70%. My son doesn't worry me nearly as much as my daughter on the effort scale.
* Rolling and asynchronous, and I'm arguing. It's not always the next day, and some of these target larger scopes than a day.
* It captures primarily pieces of my day that I don't predict.
* Mixture of first and second person. I do not understand the rules.
* Post-It Notes, disposable, my thoughts are just passing through. 
* Nothing makes me question my own sanity and [[phenomenology]] of free will more than watching the clusterfuck that is my executive functioning. 
** Lawdy, where is your practical wisdom?
* "Wake Up: Get 2 Sleep" is cute, kitschy, and perfectly stupid. 
** I'll take two whole sleeps, please.
* I have plenty of "Continue" language.
** Am I encouraging myself?
*** YOU FUCKING SICKO ;P
* Chicken or egg problems all over the place here. I cannot speak to any causal efficacy.
** Still worth it even just for the blather. Take your shit and check it twice to see if you've been naughty or nice.
* This is so ~~raven~~ meta:
** You should play more philosofrisbee.
* There's not nearly as much call and response from [[TDL]] to [[CTS]] as I had planned, but I like the kind of work they are doing. Some of the stuff I ask myself to do in [[TDL]] don't seem important enough to write about in [[CTS]]. Doesn't that seem odd? Is that really right?
** You only have so much time in the day, of course.
* [[GB]] and I seem to have much larger timelapses, but I feel like he is standing right there in front of me, clear as day. 
* Doesn't it feel like you've taken a giant step back, like everything is at a standstill in the wiki (and even other parts of life), despite the whirlwind of it? 
** This place feels to be part of that, but I can't put my finger on it well enough. I don't even know what it really means.
* Make no mistake: you are a shit rolemodel.
* I feel like such an asshole for planning fun and dumb things. Am I misdirecting myself?
** I think it's fair to have those things to look forward to. You still get shit done. This is muthafuckin' {[[Dreams]]}, dude.
