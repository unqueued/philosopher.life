title: 2019.07.19 - Prompted Introspection: Offspring Success

!! What do you feel is your greatest success?

Clearly, I don't feel confident in any of my answers to this. Answering this question in a highly generalized way is going to require understanding what is objectively valuable about the choices I've made, and likely in virtue of how difficult they were for me. Contextualized like this, I would argue my offspring are my greatest success. There are few projects I've spent so much time and energy working on and with. I feel like I've done an okay job (and they've put up with an insane person).

Sending my offspring to their uncle [[JRE]]'s for two weeks was a kind of test and confirmation for me. It was a fascinating vacuum I've not experienced before, and I think it cleared it up for a bit.
