!! Write out your life mission statement (or at least start)

I can't tell you how satisfying it is to have some giant pile of shit to hand to you, Samwise. Alright, go look at [[Root]]. It's outstandingly telic. [[Computational Existentialism]] here we go, biznatch.<<ref "b">> I'm still narrowing it down, it's messy, and this is a ridiculously hard problem. My purpose is to find one, right? =) Hey, this is better than what it was before I could admit that a purpose was necessary to this extent once again in my life. I might feel lost, but...like, in a good way.<<ref "r">> 

This might sound a bit dumb, but I'm living on gravy in the apocalypse (that doesn't make any sense). You see, what is dead may never die, and I'm not really living except on a prayer of [[hope]]. It's a wild ride in which I predictably blather in this language game about my life's mission.<<ref "s">> Call me retarded and idealistic, but I actually believe I might make a difference in the lives of my children and [[other]] people. I'm trying to make it a [[good]] and [[right]] one.
