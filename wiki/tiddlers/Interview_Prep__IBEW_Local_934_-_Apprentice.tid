title: Interview Prep: IBEW Local 934 - Apprentice

* Why the move away from pipefitting?
** //First, I think the electrician industry is fascinating. It's huge. There are lot of directions to go, and I'm interested eventually (long-term) in PLCs, solar, and data work. Additionally, there is some overlap between pipefitting and electrician trades. Installing conduit, pipebending, and thread pipe is right up my alley. I've also noticed there's more local work for electricians than pipefitters. Pipefitters have to travel more, and there's not as much maintenance opportunity. Some of the pipe I've laid is going to stay, largely untouched, for the next 100 years. Lastly, on the jobs I've been on, I've also been impressed with the electricians I've met; they are smart people who work on site from start to finish, and I've enjoyed working with them.//


!! Common Questions/Responses:

* __Tell me about yourself.__
** //When I was a teenager, I worked as a commercial construction worker putting up insulation. I've built computers and networks for a long time. I've always been fascinated with electronics; you have to especially careful around them, and it's taught me to pay attention to detail. Safety matters, making sure my materials become the product I need is important, but I also love making it look good. Shipbuilding runs in my family, so I became a pipefitter who also welds on the side. I've worked commercial and industrial sites. I like working with my hands, and actually building something I can look and see at the end of day. It's satisfying to see how my craft and hard work creates something valuable and useful.//

* __Why do you want to work at our company?__
** //I want to be an electrician, but not just any electrician. I want to work with The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who represent 750,000 other electricians on this continent.

* __What was the toughest decision you ever had to make?__
** "//In life, my toughest decision has been choosing not to pursue academic philosophy. I'm good at it, and I enjoy it. But, academia doesn't pay well, acquiring a tenure-track position is like winning a small lottery, and I didn't appreciate the publish or perish model. I had to make the practical decision to leave a vocation I loved.//"

* __What changes would you make if you came on board?__

** "//My management approach is to hire the best people I can find, train them thoroughly and well, get them excited and proud to be part of our team, and then work with them to achieve our goals together. If you do all of that right, especially hiring the right people, I've found you don't have to fire very often. Firing is a last resort. But when it's got to be done, it's got to be done, and the faster and cleaner, the better. A poor employee can wreak terrible damage in undermining the morale of an entire team of good people.//"
** "//I don't have any experience firing anyone. But, I have had to fail many students in classes. Sometimes this would set a student back an entire year of work. I do not do so lightly, and I make sure I've excellent reasons and evidence for it.//"

* __What would you do if a fellow executive on your own corporate level wasn't pulling his/her weight…and this was hurting your department?__
** "//I would speak to them directly, explain the issue, and work together to solve the problem. If they don't change their mind, then I keep trying again and again, involving wider and wider circles of people until we can solve the problem.//"

* __May I contact your present employer for a reference?__
** "//My present employer is not aware of my job search and, for obvious reasons; I'd prefer to keep it that way. I'd be most appreciative if we kept our discussion confidential right now. Of course, when we both agree the time is right, then by all means you should contact them. I'm very proud of my record there.//"

*# "//Well, a good salesman must know both his product and his prospect before he sells anything. If I were selling this, I'd first get to know everything I could about it, all its features and benefits. Then, if my goal were to sell it you, I would do some research on how you might use a fine stapler like this. The best way to do that is by asking some questions. May I ask you a few questions?//"
*# "//Just out of curiosity, if you didn't already have a stapler like this, why would you want one? And in addition to that? Any other reason? Anything else?//"
*# "//And would you want such a stapler to be reliable?...Hold a good supply of staples?//"
*#* Ask more questions that point to the features this stapler has.
*# Make your presentation citing all the features and benefits of this stapler and why it's exactly what the interviewer just told you he's looking for.
*# Close: "//Just out of curiosity, what would you consider a reasonable price for a quality stapler like this…a stapler you could have right now and would//"
*#* Repeat all the problems the stapler would solve for him, and if he says he'll buy it, tell him: "//Ok, we've got a deal.//"
*# If your interviewer tests you by fighting every step of the way, denying that he even wants such an item, don't fight him. Take the product away from him by saying: "//Mr. Prospect, I'm delighted you've told me right upfront that there's no way you'd ever want this stapler. As you well know, the first rule of the most productive salespeople in any field is to meet the needs of people who really need and want our products, and it just wastes everyone's time if we try to force it on those who don't. And I certainly wouldn't want to waste your time. But we sell many items. Is there any product on this desk you would very much like to own…just one item?//." Then repeat the above process.

* __How much money do you want?__
*# Never bring up salary. Let the interviewer do it first. 
*# If your interviewer raises the salary question too early, postpone it: "//Money is important to me, but is not my main concern. Opportunity and growth are far more important. What I'd rather do, if you don't mind, is explore if I'm right for the position, and then talk about money. Would that be okay?//"
*# Get the employer talking about what he's willing to pay before you reveal what you're willing to accept: "//I'm sure the company has already established a salary range for this position. Could you tell me what that is?//"
*# Know beforehand what you'd accept. Look for 20-25% pay increase, and more if you're underpaid.
*# Never lie about what you currently make

* __How do you define success…and how do you measure up to your own definition?__
** "//The best definition I've come across is that success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal. I would consider myself both successful and fortunate. I've had the chance to work in academia, build fascinating computing systems, and work with my hands to construct practical physical systems.//"

* __If you won $10 million lottery, would you still work?__
** "//After I floated down from cloud nine, I would still have the need to achieve something to and give meaning to my life through being productive. Money is necessary but not sufficient for happiness; I need to work to be fulfilled.//"

* __Tell me something negative you've heard about our company.__
** "//I've not heard anything negative about the company. What are your thoughts on the company?//"

*** a.k.a. __What have you learned from your previous mistakes?__
*** "//I've been fortunate enough not to make any major mistakes. However, nobody is perfect, including me. I see mistakes as opportunities to improve upon.//" 
*** "//As an instructor, my performance was regularly evaluated by my students and other faculty. I receive high marks in my evaluations. One professor, however, offered a gentle criticism of my work. He told me that I was being too charitable and neutral to authors we read and discussed in my class. He said I needed to present my opinions more forcefully. He knew I had strong opinions because I had been his student before, and he's read my work. I took his criticism as a useful license, so presented my opinions while still being fair.//"
*** "//As a top pipefitter helper, journeyman preferred working with me because I did a good job anticipating their needs. I was critique my bevel technique on a 12" stainless pipe.

** __What do you worry about?__
*** "//I wouldn't call it worry, but I am a strongly goal-oriented person. So I keep turning over in my mind anything that seems to be keeping me from achieving those goals, until I find a solution. That's part of my tenacity, I suppose.//"

** __Why should I hire you from the outside when I could promote someone from within?__
*** "// "In general, I think it's a good policy to hire from within, but if you are looking outside, then it maybe you're not completely comfortable choosing someone from inside. You want want the strongest candidate you can find, and I fit your needs best...//"

** __Why have you been out of work so long?__
