title: McManus: What the Left Can Learn From Søren Kierkegaard

<<<
“People demand freedom of speech as compensation for the freedom of thought they seldom use.” 
<<<

Lulz. Of course, I want to tease out what kinds of freedoms these really are. There are a lot of different ways to interpret this. I suggest it is an interesting bridge between political autonomy and metaphysical/agency based autonomy. It's one of "the hard problems" in political philosophy.

<<<
I think the most important of these relates to a topic that the Left has been notably silent on: broader questions of meaning.
<<<

Preach! Thank you, McManus. It's like pulling fucking teeth with pomo-oriented Leftists to get them to put their metaethical tentpegs down. Pomo has the problem of denying metanarrative. I understand the desire to be humble about it (and, of course, you can accuse me of failing in this respect, obviously).

<<<
But what these material questions don’t sufficiently capture is the desire for a more transcendent meaning which supersedes these material concerns.
<<<

PREACH! POINT TO IT! You don't go nearly far enough here, imho.

<<<
Competing ideas about life pose a threat to the stability of this collective sense of meanings and needs to be quashed through the pressure imposed by public opinion and coercive authority. 
<<<

Oh, [[The Original Position]] is a serious problem. I'm not sure how else to heuristically practice [[The Golden Rule]].
