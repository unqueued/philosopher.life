```
[19:02:25] BDS97: home: REDACTED
[19:02:34] BDS97: home: oh, sorry, that's your key
[19:02:37] h0p3: =)
[19:02:41] BDS97: home: adding more devices
[19:02:51] BDS97: home: just finished converting my chromebook to a firefoxbook
[19:02:57] BDS97: home: so now it has a full blown galliumos on it
[19:03:04] BDS97: home: figured I could run tox on that too
[19:03:15] h0p3: indeed =)
[19:04:29] BDS97: home: weird, I can't add you without the extra bits at the end of the key
[19:04:34] BDS97: home: could you send a message to this key?
[19:04:34] BDS97: home: REDACTED
[19:04:44] BDS97: home: it's my on the go key, but the end stuff is different
[19:05:10] BDS97: home: haven't checked out the tox protocol yet, no idea why it does that
[19:08:26] BDS97: home: oh, I get it, it's the nospam part
```

```
[19:18:21] BDS97: On-The-Go: autostart seems to be working as well
[19:18:29] BDS97: On-The-Go: sorry for the almost week-long silence again btw
[19:18:49] BDS97: On-The-Go: hopefully this will help with that part
