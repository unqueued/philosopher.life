!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** You did a superb job in school with the week. You worked hard, and it was a rewarding week. I'm proud of you. Keep up that hard work because it is paying off.
** When you asked for your mother's help, you take it seriously. You actually try to learn it rather than just getting it out of the way. 
** You learned your friends' names this week. Good work.
* j3d1h
** You did not give up looking for your computer! I know it was really frustrating, and you didn't give up. You had a good attitude. Lo and behold, it was in the last place you looked. You cleaned your room after it too. You saw the reason!
** Helped fix your brother's computer
** You've done a great job on your Cat-a-logs. You've been imaginative and empathic.

** You wrote your recipes down in your wiki! Thank you!
** You've been forgiving this week. e.g. when I didn't do school work, you dealt kindly with me
