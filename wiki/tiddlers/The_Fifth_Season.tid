=( Opener is fucked.

I feel a similar protectiveness of my own children. Though we have no superpower, I know we are complete outcasts. I despise the alienation, the secrecy, the forced crypto and appearance of gnosticism. 

Fascinating rationing and eugenics. When times get tough, when the those in power must actually sacrifice, that's when you see what a society is really made of. 

I'm not sure what the Guardians remind me of. Still has plenty of the X-men vibe. I'm worried that class roles won't make sense; the supernatural always has this problem.

Obviously, I can't say this is a //human// experience, but it's a personhood experience much like ours. 

Hopefully, we'll see plenty of fucking.

10th ringer is not believable.

Turn my grunting and farting into babies.

Plenty of classism, and it's got plenty of the psychology. I love the untouchables nested in the untouchables.
