title: 2018.11.02 - Guitar: Blood

Played thrice today. My son and I practiced Canon in D together. For our second time through, it sounded not bad. I'm loving the sound, but this is one of my favorite pieces to play of all time (regardless of instrument).

My daughter continued her work. I think she is recognizing what I was talking about yesterday. I could see and hear a difference in her practicing today.

While watching House today, I played more classical and Celtic. Also, I'm using two books now, and it is much more comfortable. 

Played late into the night. Bit o blood from muh fangers.

I'm been practicing pulloffs and hammerons some. I often forego them because think they don't sound as good in many cases. But, sometimes it just flows right. I hope to become more skilled at knowing when to do what.
