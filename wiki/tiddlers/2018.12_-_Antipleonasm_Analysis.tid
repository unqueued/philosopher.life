!! Audit:

* These started out as being long responses, and in my usual form, I have quickly started offering short answers.
** Dude, any answer is better than none! Just keep writing! =)
** It's fine to start out with a bang and start normalize. This log is still in its infancy.
*** Do you remember how long it took you to get [[Prompted Introspection]] like you have it today? This is, by comparison, rapid.
* I'm loving my [[title.Title]]s for these.
* I'm wondering what kinds of [[Antipleonasms]] and [[hlexical]] terms will come out of this log (if any).
** That doesn't appear to be the purpose, but could just be gravy.
* I love dissecting particular points of view. This reminds me of a hyper-crystallized [[Meaningness]] [[Deep Reading]] approach. It's [[hyperreading]] in a sense, but it has solid depth to it.
** I am especially reminded of freewriting with prompts that I respect.
* It's fascinating to see this log might pull from all over the wiki. It's extremely biased too.
* I think this is more [[ehyeh]] than [[RPIN]].
