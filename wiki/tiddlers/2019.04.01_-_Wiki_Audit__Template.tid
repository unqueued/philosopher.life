title: 2019.04.01 - Wiki Audit: Template

Added [[Wiki Review: Template]], which works pretty well for now. I'm not sure why Antipleonasm Analysis is being doubled - it doesn't happen outside of Bob.

It didn't double today. Everything initially appears clean. I have no idea how to reproduce it.

---

I need to try Codemirror again. It might untangle the font problem. 

---

[[dziggetai]] thinks it may be a mistake to go the [[Firmcoding]] route. He thinks it artificially limits the wiki, and he's convinced I should go heavier on tag-mechanics. Though he denies it, he likely knows something I do not here; I barely understand how this tool works. I [[hope]] to see as he does.

I'm lucky to have anyone wrestle with me on this topic. I'm completely out of my league.

Nope. m14 failure without any indication again. Savetrail and fixing by hand works for now.
