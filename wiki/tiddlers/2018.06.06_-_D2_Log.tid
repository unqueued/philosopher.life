Got to A3, picked up Spider's eye. I looted some 20FRW 20MF boots with a resist on them, I think. Bye bye Vid's. I need MF so badly, and boots have the be the cheapest place to pay for them. Marrowalks don't mean shit, but the MF and resists surely do. I always loot boots because the best boots in the game are Rare.

Have a 75hp belt. That's a lot of HP for me right now. 

Entered and exited A2 Normal to buy a staff for Leaf.
