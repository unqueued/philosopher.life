*** I am SHOCKED that //The Hill// has this. It's gorgeous.

*** Indeed, it's happening.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.thegwpf.com/the-riots-over-macrons-global-warming-tax-could-end-his-career/
*** Riots make sense. This I did not anticipate.

* Think About It
** https://avc.com/2018/12/centralization-vs-decentralization/
*** But, why should I trust them? Why should I think they would create best effort APIs? Why should I think they aren't really interested in centralizing power?
** https://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2018/12/01/the-case-against-the-case-against-education-average-was-always-over/
*** I deny the claim that we shouldn't all be college educated (or to the best of our capacities). It is clear that education is the key to a functioning democracy. Still, there are excellent arguments in here otherwise.
** https://blog.tildes.net/announcing-tildes
*** I have no idea if this is going anywhere. I am always in search of reddit alternatives.
** https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31496-7
*** I think we've known something like this is the case. Those with superior memory must pose an interesting question. Looks Bayesian.
** https://escapingplatoscave.com/spinozas-ethics-and-the-reconciliation-of-spirituality-and-reason/
*** I think this Zen goal, the denial of self, the denial of evil, the denial of non-being, the denial of contingency is a copout. Sorry, Saint Spinoza.

* Fishy

*** Absolutely fascinating to see this. I have no idea what it means. I certainly don't trust their motives.
** http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/i%E2%80%99ll-believe-it-when-i-meme-it-anu-study
*** Why is there no traditional Dawkins notion being discussed here?
** https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/what-would-happen-if-everyone-truly-believed-everything-is-one/
*** The question is whether or not this is wielded to justify things like moral relativism, apathy, or reactionary positions. The sublator of capitalism can be a psychopath.
** https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/12/president-george-h-w-bush-blamed-the-fed-for-his-1992-reelection-loss-and-the-fed-is-doing-the-same-thing-to-president-trump-today/
*** Ofc, they are still defending capitalism.

* For my self:
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snR1PmvQYoY&feature=youtu.be
*** Yeah, yeah, internalism. I got it. What is tricky to me is that I don't see the horse/woman image nicely! I see the horse a bit, but mostly I just see the image as was before I saw the reveal.

* For my children:
** https://www.wired.com/story/rowhammer-ecc-memory-data-hack/
*** Fascinating hack.
** https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/11/19/the-psychopharmacology-of-everyday-life/
*** A solid narratival introduction.

* For my son:

*** Thought you might find this interesting.
