title: Modality

Definitions:

* A proposition is //necessary// just in case it is true in all [[possible worlds|Possible World]].
* A proposition is //possible// just in case it is true in some possible worlds.
* A proposition is //contingent// just in case it is true in some but not all possible worlds.
* A //rigid designator// is an expression that singles out the same thing in all possible worlds.

Ontic vs Epistemic Modality:

The ontic possibility of contingency is a fundamental //a priori// question in philosophy. Does contingency exist? Are there non-actualized states of affairs? If this is the only possible world, then it appears much of our epistemic modalized language is non-sense. 

Even if we can have a priori knowledge of other possible worlds, how can we have empirical knowledge of other possible worlds? 

All and only the a priori truths are necessary

Epistemically, i.e. in language, the semantic content of a proposition can be understood as conjunctive set of all possible worlds in which that sentence is true. In other words, propositions form virtual machines for our minds to simulate and reason about.

Can we meaningfully claim: "It's contingently possible that everything is necessary"?
