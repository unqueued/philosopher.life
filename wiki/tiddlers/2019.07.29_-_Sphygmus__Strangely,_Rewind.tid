> I hope you are doing well. What have you been up to? How's life going?

I'm not sure what I covered last time we talked, but it's been a busy and emotional few months for me, though I'm not sure I remember half of it. 

* ''April:'' I had to go back and read our discord messages to remember what I was up to. ðŸ˜… Looks like I was all about letterboxing and getting Arch Linux set up on my chrome book then.
* ''May:'' I ~~finally~~ started progress on applying to jobs -- which mostly looked like making lists of them on Indeed. I applied to a "Business Analyst Web Development" position, and also an Archive Assistant position that a coworker recommended me for. Then I stopped applying to anything else. I started working on the [[CollectScents|https://sphygm.us/#CollectScents]] web app while waiting to hear back from jobs (and trying to build my portfolio).
* ''June:'' I was feeling on average pretty down in both May and June, and generally sick of working retail at a store that felt like it was on the brink of collapsing. I had two interviews this month (for the two positions I applied for in May) and both went well, despite much anxiety on my part. I got final results at the end of the month and started the transition to a new job.<<footnote "m" "The business analyst position was 'put on hold' so I accepted the Archive Assistant position.">> I also picked Stardew Valley back up and almost all of my spare time was spent playing that. 

This month has been completing the transition from my old job to my new job! I tried to leave things in a decent state at the art store, making sure my knowledge about our email system and website got transferred as much as possible to the people taking over those roles. Really saw how much I'd been doing when having to train people on all of it. 

Now I'm starting my 5th full week at the new job - I can barely believe it's been that much time already! I've been learning and doing so much each day compared to where I was before, so the workdays go by quickly instead of dragging on.

Before college, when I was still in high school, an organization called QuestBridge got my name and sent an informational mailing about going to college as a low income student. I applied for and was awarded a spot in a college prep conference they were having, which is more relevant to the story later. I also applied early action to several colleges through them (which waived application fees) and while I wasn't matched with any schools for a full ride scholarship, that application did lead to my early acceptance from the University of Chicago and (I'm sure I've mentioned) between a very generous local scholarship and uChicago's financial aid package, I'm now on the other side with no loans. All that to say -- I don't know what your plans when you start going into that process with your kids, but I think it's definitely worth looking into the resources QuestBridge could provide. 

Because of the pre-college program I was a part of, I've been included in the Quest activities in college and since then, though I didn't really do a lot with the student organization at uChicago. Anyway, long way around, QuestBridge turned 25 this year and had a celebratory conference in San Francisco this past weekend which I just got back from! That could be the subject of a whole letter by itself! Will be?

So, now I'm back to living regular life. I was so unsure about what life would be like without the structure of school as a college senior, and between the new job and the conference I'm sitting here with that uncertainty again. It's different, because I'm actually living in it now rather than anticipating it, but still. I've essentially hit the majority of the major life milestones and from here until I'm 40, and 80, and so on is gonna be about how I choose to fill that time, rather than aiming to complete certain checkbox goals.<<footnote "well" "really the only big two left are marriage and kids and those feel generally less obligatory than everything before them. The kid question is a knotty one and idk even how to think about it, so I haven't. Right now I'm telling myself that I don't want kids b/c idk, a world dying of climate change seems like a shitty place to inherit - idk, it's a Gordian Knot if I ever saw one.">> Similarly, something that's been on my mind lately is self-perception through change, and how to think about who I've been in the past when it can feel so different from who I am now.

Oh, and of course, travel brings [[Placeness|https://sphygm.us/#Placeness]] to the forefront of my mind. I'm always a little nostalgic for public transit and it gets even stronger after spending some time in a place with subways.<<footnote "bs" "I'm really bad at using buses, though. I never got on a single bus when I studied abroad in Paris, and not in San Fran either. I was pretty competent/comfortable with them in Chicago, but that's because I had one of those tap & go cards -- it always seems like a hassle to figure out how to pay for buses when traveling, and their routes seem less straightforward than trains (whether or not that's actually true).">>

Part of me is really attached to the idea of knowing a place well -- I want to observe the intricacies of how all the moving (slow and fast) parts come together, and to form some sort of instinctual gut knowledge that comes through time and immersion. I don't think I'd actually let that get in the way of moving if moving was something I really wanted to do, but idk.

Still, I was really emotional at leaving -- there's things about cities that feel really good and that make me wish I lived in them. Like: I prefer the bustle of a really crowded city center to a smaller city center with much, much less foot traffic. I feel less exposed, and more able to just be as much me as I can -- there's so many people around that any strangeness on my part in terms of actions or dress or anything just blends in with the overall range of strangeness in cities. And I prefer the diversity -- being around so many different ways of living makes the more homogeneous places seem boring and uninteresting.

> I appreciate that you dig for it.

Ohhh man I feel so self-centered searching for myself on your wiki but I'm also super curious so I do it anyway!

I wonder what a "highlight reel" would look like? It seems to me like that's almost your rootier tiddlers anyway -- the ones with the most effort and time and writing devoted to them, yes? And then you also have to decide what is most interesting or important for you to highlight when that could quite possibly vary from what other people think are most interesting or important by a wide margin.<<footnote "UGH" "oh my god I've been sitting outside writing this letter for about a half hour and I already have 2 bug bites on my foot?!!! what the fuck is this nonsense, I haven't had any mosquito bites all season until now. :C">>

> I've slowed down recently on that log, the hoarded buildup is getting worse, lol.

You're a link dragon! Stockpiling your hoard of shiny tabs in the cave of Firefox's RAM usage. :D

I'm so glad to have inspired your dynamic wiki experimentation -- and I'm glad that it's fun! Locator seems interesting -- I'm not sure I understand how it works, but I haven't used it a lot either. Search of h0p3 definitely came in handy when I was searching myself, though, because I'd forgotten the filter text syntax, hah. And it's nifty to have it all in one spot there!

> I'll be interested to know if it is like riding a bicycle for you...

I'm not sure if this is an impulse you've ever felt, but after about 2 or 3 years of using my computers, I tend to get an itch to back up my files, delete everything, and start over with a fresh install. It was that same sort of urge I was feeling, coming back to my wiki. But, idk, I'm going forward without rebuilding it at the moment, and we'll see if I still feel that itch after spending more time in it going forward. I'd like to figure out how to evolve in place, rather than starting from scratch.

Btw - your web URLs are different when I click on tiddlers! It looks like they have link-like brackets in the actual URL? What's the story there?

> Does that go for both in your private use and public?

Yes, definitely, though slightly more for public writing than private. I don't feel it as much when I read old journals, say, but there's much more time and age difference there so I tend to approach them with gentle amusement.

I posit that it's easier to be vulnerable and open in meatspace or over voice chat than it is to be in writing, because of the more-or-less permanence of writing. Moments of vulnerability and openness can be emotionally overwhelming for me, and I go back to being less open/aware/grounded in my body in between those moments. I think that's a major part of my resistance to reading some of my own writing.

It seems this relates to the next part -- the fear of "performative" writing being a fear of vulnerability in a way that feels like an opening for mockery or denigration (regardless of whether or not that's a legitimate possibility).

Some wandering: performance holds connotations of rehearsal, recitation, editing, facades, and masks for me. Those connotations seem to be the opposite of "being oneself" or "authenticity" but -- I mean, if I am aware of my thoughts, and aware of my emotions, and aware of my awareness, and there is an open space where "I am that I am" is not collapsed into my emotions, or my thoughts, or my ego -- and if "authenticity" is synonymous with "acting from thoughts/emotions without being aware of them" then it seems authenticity is not what I want to strive for. So in a sense, performance is merely having the freedom of choice in how to act, separately from thoughts and emotions.

> How's CollectScents going? Looks like you're deep into something fun.

I haven't touched it in a while -- it was my project while I was waiting to hear back from jobs, and during the last two weeks at the art store and my first weeks at the new job, I was really diving into Stardew Valley for the emotional comfort. I'm in the middle of refactoring my query code for CollectScents, which I feel uncertain about, but which also has to get done before I start adding any new systems (like users and user data).

I also think the question of "is this just fun project for me or am I going try and launch it as an actual thing for other people to use?" is getting in my way. Some hard-core imposter syndrome worries setting in about it not being "good enough" to be released or that it's got messy code and is just hacked together blah blah. Which, true, I'm much less skilled than anyone who's been writing code for their day job for the past X number of years, and I'm sure there's a lot of code smells, but I gotta learn to walk before I can learn to drive and there's lots of falling over when you learn to walk, right?!

That aside, I'm super into Neo4j as a database -- makes the data modelling much easier than with a relational database -- and Bootstrap has actually been really great for quickly prototyping a decent looking website (though it's pretty different than doing all the CSS by hand).

TV shows, hm -- well, I can't find any results for //Killing Eve// or //Fleabag// in your wiki, so I will highly recommend those. Phoebe Waller-Bridge also was involved with //Crashing//<<footnote "C4" "not the American comedy show, but the British Channel 4 show">>, which isn't quite on the same level as the other two but I still very much enjoyed it. //Dark// is also phenomenal, and //The Handmaid's Tale//, though so far I enjoyed the first two seasons of that more than I've been enjoying the 3rd season. //Chernobyl// was fascinating! Oh, and while //Legion//'s story is good but not great, the visual design and cinematography is out of this world -- insanely well done and gorgeous. Have you seen //Hannibal//?

OH and omg, k0sh3k, so much congratulations on your interview with Yale!! I'm sending all my best thoughts and encouragement your way and I hope it goes well!

Finally -- and maybe this is a case where even asking the question changes the answer -- does my writing seem different to you in this letter? It does to me, but I can't quite put my finger on why or how or where.

Hugs to everyone from me!
