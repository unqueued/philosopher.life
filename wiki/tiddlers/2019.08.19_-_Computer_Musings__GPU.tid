Dunst, apparently, wasn't working. I do not understand why. This may have solved some of my electron problems with Dicksword and Signal.

My used RX 570 showed up. Unlike [[m10]], changing [[m16]]'s system is ridiculously easy. 10 minutes flat to install it. My vanity is boundless; I even routed the 8-pin cabling through the PSU shroud.

I thought I had already enabled virtualization, but apparently I didn't do it thoroughly enough:

`dmesg | grep -i -e DMAR -e IOMMU`

Skid into finding IOMMU group of the AMD card:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
shopt -s nullglob
for g in /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/*; do
    echo "IOMMU Group ${g##*/}:"
    for d in $g/devices/*; do
        echo -e "\t$(lspci -nns ${d##*/})"
    done;
done;

```

```
IOMMU Group 19:
	04:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Ellesmere [Radeon RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X/590] [1002:67df] (rev ef)
	04:00.1 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Ellesmere HDMI Audio [Radeon RX 470/480 / 570/580/590] [1002:aaf0]
