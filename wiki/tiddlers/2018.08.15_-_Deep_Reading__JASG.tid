Why do I make the connection between a nation, a people, and a culture? In the current climate, the political arena is fraught with language and views that are scary and disorienting.
<<<

The reason you make the connection is directly because it's an arena that scares and disorients people. You are engaged in sophistry. 

Let me grant that every effective systematic philosophy must explain what it means, how, and why we ought to interact with others. It's far from clear why your systematic perspective is the right one. You have your own specific brand of Christianity here too; what makes it the right one?

<<<
In one instance, a trail of lies makes no difference to the electorate, proving that the most valuable thing in human discourse, truth, is an expendable value if power is obtained. In another instance, even extreme and sometimes pejorative statements on people and views don’t seem to matter, and the dignity of office is replaced, once again, by the quest for power.
<<<

I see your goal is to point out a false dichotomy. This language defining the sides is vague on purpose because we can all seem to make something fit into it (even when we disagree on what/who belongs where). Obviously, I take your initial claim, "you are talking about this because it scares people" very seriously.

<<<
Candidates coming to the fore propound ideas that are creating anger and protests that make the future very fearsome. For one, “dishonest” sums it up. For the other, “disrespectful” or worse, “prejudice” is the charge. Whether these are legitimate assertions or not is secondary to the assumption that morality matters.
<<<

I grant the necessity of studying eschatology and existential threats. Are you sure this is the best way to describe or reduce it? Why should I think so? Moreover, why do you think your conception of morality is somehow better than mine, or an atheist's, or any random person's? Even your basic moral realist claim here requires significant legwork in philosophy which you've failed to provide. You are continuing to be realpolitik here.

<<<
Ironically, the protestors protesting the candidates themselves resort to injurious means. But what is obvious is that statecraft has become soulcraft, and a nation that formally wishes to deny God finds its imperatives in a deadly mix of conflicting worldviews and hate-laden words on a path to power. What has happened? The answer is clear. The discussion in the public square is now reduced to right or left, forgetting there is an up and a down.
<<<

So, statecraft as soulcraft is older than Christianity. Plato's //Republic// and //The Statesman// are solid examples (and, in fact, via St. Augustine, it defined Christianity through syncretism, and it still does). Let's be clear, it's a huge leap from the claim that "being a good citizen is conceptually linked to being a good person" all the way to "being a good citizen is conceptually linked to being a Christian" (or even a theist as you would define it). It seems like all the real work is in explaining why Christianity is definitionally better than all the other options, and you've not done that.

I'm not saying you can't make these links outright, and I'm not tone-policing here either. It's your duty in the dialectic to magnanimously state your thesis clearly, actually support it, then conclude its completion. Be prepared for the possibility of losing. You actually have to cooperate in the dialectic. Perhaps that is what you take yourself to be doing here. It's pretty obvious to your opposition that you aren't. You don't get to just claim victory here. 

I also must point out that "hate-laden" words is something you need to define. I know a lot of Christians who are going to think that even a fairly neutral, kindly explained critique of Christianity is tantamount to radical persecution, i.e. that any criticism which calls their worldview into doubt is unquestionably "hate-laden." 

I grant the dialectic is a dangerous wrestling-battlegrounds. At least one of us delusional and radically wrong about the nature of reality, and in a sense, our identities are at stake. Unfortunately, some people you take to be hateful are actually just highly effective (and more justified), even in their kindness and honor. You suggest it with lip service earlier, but it's not obvious you take that possibility seriously. 

There's also something wrong here when you imply the political landscape is dichotomized, but that we are all ignoring the false dichotomy. That's not what demographic studies show. It's way messier, and almost everyone I know believes there is more than right and left (and legitimately acts on that belief). This sweeping generalization is not accurate, and that is a redflag.

<<<
These matters alone remind us that we had better understand this philosophy called atheism and why it leads where it does.
<<<

I'm not convinced you even have a solid grasp of where atheism can possibly lead. You should not imply that it has a singular path or end either (you have an ambiguous statement here which is slippery). You agree you want to know your enemy, but it's not clear you've actually stepped in their shoes. I've yet to see your charity.

Your problem might be that you think Christians have a monopoly on fundamental wisdom. You have to give an argument for it. You have to explain and justify why articles like The Bible are universally and categorically authoritative in all contexts. So far, you've been handwaiving. 

<<<
Strange, isn’t it, that atheists in the West want the term marriage redefined while their counterparts in Russia and China will have nothing of that redefinition? Both have their own reasons, and there is no common point of reference. That’s precisely the edifice built on the bedrock of naturalism. 
<<<

This isn't just atheists, but a ton of theists as well. Look at Millenials and Gen Z; those who even remain Christian or theist still have very high rates of accepting non-traditional definitions and structures of marriage from legal, moral, and religious perspectives. You don't get to just pin this on atheists. That's patently false and misleading. You also don't just get to help yourself to even the implication that redefinition is a bad thing.

Russian and China are incredibly complex cultures, and you also don't have the right to make those statements. I'm also wondering if there is a Red Scare dogwhistle-like face to this argument. 

Do you really think we there is no common point of reference? Consider this: 

`a = a` or `P->Q, P; therefore, Q` or etc.

I think even the use of the English language is a rhizomatic set of things we hold in common. You are purposely overstating your position. 

I don't see why you get to dump this all on naturalism. Further, you continue to conflate naturalism with atheism. You also completely ignore the problem of other religious traditions here. 

<<<
Each person is a law unto himself.
<<<

Pure subjectivism and postmodernity are mind-blowingly hard problems. I doubt you have background in the problem of autonomy as well (which literally means "self-legislator"). Practicing faith really is about binding ourselves to the best axioms/laws/reasons/systems we can find. 

I'm worried you accuse anyone not Christian, but especially atheists, of automatically being relativists and naturalists who are responsible for the downfall of the political world. Christians are also responsible for the problems you're seeing here. 

<<<
Remember in the Old Testament when people wanted a king and God said that He wanted to be their ruler? The people fought back and said they wanted to be like every other nation and, in fact, have somebody else to fight their wars while they could go about their lives. They got what they wanted and found out that the greatest battles were ultimately for the rule of one’s heart. Once that becomes autonomous, culture and politics become lawless. And when those battles are lost, the war that looms is of huge proportions. This is, at best, the unintended consequence of atheism.
<<<

Why do you think atheism is fundamentally going to lead to anarchy, lawlessness, or evil? Why should we accept your conceptual conflations and unjustified causal claims? 

It appears you are arguing against autonomy only when it doesn't give you the answer you want.

The Christian Memeplex is a mental virus (like all memes) in the minds of networks of human specimens through history. It's clearly done good thing and bad things in politics. You aren't even trying to fairly reason about this; instead you foist all the presumed evil consequences onto atheism. Atheism's various memeplexes just haven't been nearly as powerful as you imply, unless you mean to say anything which isn't Christian is functionally atheism (and even then, Christianity has been very powerful).

<<<
We think atheism is some kind of newfangled thinking, that science and its bequest gave way to autonomy and our solitude in the universe. That is simply not so. The formalization of it and giving it intellectual respect may have taken time, but the question goes back to the beginning of time.
<<<

You are denying that it's newfangled thinking, but I don't know why the rest of us should be taken to have made that assumption (why agree to "we" here?). I assume atheism is much older than theism. Theism is a very complex set of beliefs that primitive primates had to take time to evolve. That memeplex had to emerge from atheism. This is the dialectic. You start with the "nothing" and build (or discover) "something." Christianity is much newer than many other formalized belief systems. The initial questions, of course, are old. 

<<<
Right from the start the question was not the origin of species but the autonomy of the species. We are more prone to quote from the Wilberforce/Huxley debate or the Galileo/Church conflict than to look back and see where such real tensions began.
<<<

Why should we agree that to that timeline? Whose question is this? The problem of autonomy, as a concept, may be just as old as the concept of the origin of species of any kind of evolution. It is obvious, however, that you need an origin of the species before you can evolve to have autonomy. I don't see why you notion of these tensions is meaningful here. You don't resolve them at all either. This line of reasoning in general seems irrelevant.

<<<
We think Darwin buried God, but in fact, in Genesis 3, the very first in the created order wished to bury Him too.
<<<

Who thinks that? Are you sure you are engaged in apologetics or confirming the bias of those who want to dismiss the opposition out of hand with a strawman? Darwin is not the end of God at all. I'll agree that science poses problems for several lines and sects of many religions, including Christianity, but I know plenty of Christians, non-Christians, and atheists who can see the above is poor reasoning.

Furthermore, you don't get to invoke the Bible as authoritative until after you justified why it's authoritative. You don't get to use itself as the reason for its own authority.

<<<
All the way to Calvary, the first attempt at death was the death of God. The killing of God was followed by the killing by Cain of his brother, Abel. The Bible addresses this conflict from the pre-Mosaic era. After all, the battle in Genesis was really based on two questions. The battle between theism and atheism is the oldest philosophical debate.
<<<

Why should I think it's the oldest philosophical debate? It's among them, related to them, and perhaps even the most fundamental of them. That's not the claim it's the oldest philosophical debate though. You are overreaching. I don't see why I have to buy the Christian metanarrative here either. You are telling a specific group of Christians what they want to hear, but you aren't making a good argument in general.

<<<
What are the two questions that existed for humanity from the beginning of creation? The first salvo hurled against God in the Garden was “Did God really say?” In the gospel story, the temptation of Jesus resurrects the same question, either by questioning a text or by wrenching it free from its context. The test brought to Jesus in the desert, the same test brought in the Garden, was “Has God said?” and “Is it true?” Those questions implicitly asked whether there was an up and a down. Is there a prescriptive backdrop to life? Can I not be my own definer of good and evil? Am I subject to some higher non-tangible authority?
<<<

Why should we agree these are the questions from the beginning of creation? Why can't it be the "implicitly asked" questions which are obviously more fundamental in the epistemic foundation? It seems to me you have a serious uphill battle. Again, you have not provided evidence for the Christian metanarrative.

<<<
The key here is that he simply does not believe God would reveal Himself in propositional truth. Paine didn’t invent that predicament. It existed from the beginning. Revelation was not in a vacuum of belief. Revelation was sustained by evidence and propelled by a reality check, time and again. The very means by which we ascertain truth is not merely an inner voice but the rationale of why we are here in the first place.
<<<

I can agree that Reason is at the core justifying itself as an axiom. Why should we think Christianity or any religion is that? You don't get to just help yourself to this either. Again, it appears that which cannot be doubted by definition is immutably constitutive of Reason. What is mutability built on top of that may also be constitutive, but you have to start arguing for your other axioms through at least coherentist perspectives (if not externalist as well). 

<<<
The question should really be why we even think of a supreme being. Why do we ask if there is a sovereign power over the universe?
<<<

What makes you think all cultures do ask those questions? It's pretty obvious they don't ask or answer like the Christians in many cases as well. Why should we assume God is a sovereign agent or has power? You don't get to just help yourselves to stuffing arguments into our mouths here, unless you really are just preaching to the choir who wants to be told they were right all along without any argumentation. 

Even if they did, should that count as an argument in favor of it? 

<<<
Is it because we are deluded into thinking there should be, or is it because reason demands a cause and a purpose?
<<<

You don't get to assume that the Principle of Sufficient Reason (where you are driving at, I believe) results in Christian belief, or even a belief in the theist's God. Telic reasoning does not require it. You've swept the alternatives under the rug and attempted to force a conceptual relationship here that isn't necessarily true. That is deceptive.

<<<
Is it possible that deep within our hungers is this quest to know why we are here in the first place, and the naturalist’s cavalier dismissal of that question falls upon questing souls that search for a reason as much as the body yearns for water?
<<<

Again, atheist != naturalist. You also have to resolve the problem of other religions and establish the authority of Bible (good luck) as well. You are trying to compress your opponents into a strawman here. 

You aren't being fair to naturalists either. You don't have sufficient reasons to stereotype them as cavalierly dismissing that question. Many just answer it differently than you do. Let be me clear, I think naturalism is an utter failure too, but your reasoning is unacceptable.

<<<
There were no professors of science in the original created order to question revelation.
<<<

I suppose it depends on what you mean by "original created order," and that is not something you get to help yourself to without justification either.

Many intelligent people think the Bayesian method of empirically reasoning is fundamental to any kind of intelligence. Responding to Kant is what we are still doing today. Induction is a process of modeling, and that's really what scientists are doing. I don't see how we aren't scientists who also rely upon axioms. 

Questioning revelation is also at the heart of orthodox Christianity.

Your claim appears to have a lot of emotional content to it. I see a lot of Christians who hate academia. This plays nicely as emotional appeal, but it's not an argument.

<<<
From deep within the human soul arose the challenge for autonomy over against a boundary within which to live. So let’s get over two blunders—the one that thinks this is modern man in revolt, and the other that thinks intellectuals disbelieve in God and only the naïve or stupid continue to believe in God. I have met intellectuals on both sides of the issue, and it is not merely an intellectual struggle. It is a struggle of bridge building, of trying to tie theoretical structures to heartfelt and heart-hungering realities.
<<<

I agree to several of the moves you make here. However, I don't see why those two blunders are truly blunders. Insofar as emotional reasoning from our limbic system is fundamental to our ability to engage in the dialectic, I agree there is a unification process in our reasoning which isn't reducible to mere cognition. It is, ultimately, a struggle to be wise. Belief in [[The Telos]] is belief in some kind of God, imho. I see no reason to think it's the Christian one.

Your arguments have been an emotional rallying cry. I don't see the bridge-building here.

<<<
The second question that originated in Genesis came in the form of a challenge: “You will not surely die! You will be as God, defining good and evil.”
<<<

I think you misrepresent your opposition, including the non-Christians (and even some Christians). Maybe this is how one ought to interpret Genesis (debatable), but this isn't a charitable representation of your opposition. Again, see the various problems surrounding the Biblical authority problem.

<<<
For Darwin, as for our polite modern thinkers, hell is anathema.
<<<

Well, hell is supposed to be anathema, right? We shouldn't want it. You mean the possibility of it. Well, the vast majority of humanity doesn't believe in the Christian's notion of hell (plenty of Christians don't either!). Why should we agree to your particular beliefs? Don't you need to give us public reasons?

<<<
Why would any self-respecting human being think up hell?
<<<

Traditionally, the social Darwinian story tells a story about primitive humans started a rumor/belief-system in hell as a method to subdue other humans, to prevent "might makes right," and to make moral or religious reasoning play a bigger role in how we interacted with each other. It may be a plausible story, and I'd like to see why it's wrong. Regardless, that people don't like the idea of hell isn't an argument against the belief there is no hell.

You have to give reasons for your construction here. Why does it represent reality more clearly than the other models?

<<<
Interestingly, these who challenge the existence of God are the very ones who are willing to punish others for their beliefs.
<<<

It seems pretty obvious to me that the Abrahamic faiths have been notoriously wielded to punish others for their beliefs. In fact, I can see persecution caused by almost all parties here, theist, atheist, or other. You aren't even attempting to see the truth here. This is pure ideology.

<<<
“Destroy the livelihood of those who believe in the sanctity of marriage!” 
<<<

This is scaremongering. Those who are destroying our livelihoods often include Christians as reactionaries and Capitalists. The notion this is connected to the sanctity of marriage is a non-sequitur. This is not logical; it's designed to generate anger to blind someone into thinking it's a justification. When the merit of your argument only exists in virtue of the emotions it causes, you have an argument which bears much closer scrutiny.

<<<
“Don’t give them a place in academia if they really believe God exists!”
<<<

Belief in God is not the same as belief in the Christian God. It's clearly not an accident that you continually make this error. It's not a slip of the tongue.

Many academics do believe in God, even the Christian God. And, you should be worried that many of the smartest people on the planet have profound disagreements with your perspective on God. It's time to cough up a real argument.
