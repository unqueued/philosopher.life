!! Audit:

* I wrote quite a bit. It's not much of a story, but it helps me reason and remember.
* I think speaking with individual students has become one of my clearer objectives.
** As usual, I'm much more useful 1-on-1 than I am in group settings (unless everyone is voluntarily there).
* I'm trying to connect, but I'm failing fairly often.
* I'm not a fan of my shitty students, but I aim to help them. 
* I <3 The Janitor
* Fascinating: I like more than 3% of the people there (though I wouldn't want to hang out with a single one of them).
* Everyone is stressed.
* Some of these kids experience insanity. I have no idea how they aren't insane themselves.
* I have a broad range of escalation, up into being a brutal figure to some of the kids, cutting them off mid-sentence over and over with the rebuttal to what they were about to finish saying, up in their grill, demanding they do what is required.
** Otherwise, I am the most chillaxed human there.
* The adults despise that I don't enforce technology and book censorship rules. 
** They can fuck off.
** They would be horrified that I attempt to help these children protect their privacy and control their devices.
* I have good jokes in here, but I've barely begun to push the envelope. 
* I wish I worked with a bunch of Mitchell's.
* Chess has been good.
* I have my geek squad. I love them.
* I'm enjoying my job. That is wonderful.
