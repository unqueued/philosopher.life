* Stunning!
** https://www.topic.com/the-limits-of-empathy
*** This is the second article from Topic.com that has blown me away.

* Preach, yo!
** https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7qh3dr/im_a_republican_what_on_earth_is_wrong_with_my/dsp7177/

* Confirm My Bias
** http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jssr.12365/abstract
*** Time to dig up a Mark Twain quote.
** https://blog.keep.network/miners-arent-your-friends-cde9b6e0e9ac
*** Not my treadmill.
** http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/01/15/decentralization-bitcoin-ethereum/
*** I prefer going for the network protocol itself!
** http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-biden-will-never-connect-with-millennials/article/2645991
*** Democrats feeding us bullshit, yet again.

* Think About It
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students/
*** Of course, I champion the humanities, but I am also convinced that it takes dedication to have the right technical skills to do this. If you've seen Google's hiring process, you'll see they are incredibly picky when it comes to talent. I think there are also lots of kinds of employees. Obviously, soft skills are going to be fundamental for everyone, but some people basically only engage in them.

* Fishy
** http://www.newsweek.com/russia-drones-nuclear-weapons-pentagon-leak-781075
*** Scaremongering.
** https://www.myce.com/news/confirmed-issue-google-cast-causes-temporarily-wifi-drops-around-world-83428/
*** It is odd, no doubt. That said, I think router manufacturers are scam-artists.
** https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/researchers-finds-that-one-person-likely-drove-bitcoin-from-150-to-1000/
*** I should stay out of the market.
** Top Quora Message for me was about Rust...<<ref "2019.03.21">>
*** How are they tracking me? Maybe it is coincidence. I will pay attention.

* Interesting
** https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/1/223888-decentralized-blockchain-based-electronic-marketplaces/abstract
** http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/hallucinations.pdf
** https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn
** http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/09/1713532115
*** Sounds right, right?
** https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/15/16863374/willpower-overrated-self-control-psychology
*** Not the most sophisticated argument, but I appreciate it.

* Tools

* For my wife:
** https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/02/02/how-to-name-things/
*** Your obsessions with names. Worth a peek. This has a weird structure to it (weirder than usual).
