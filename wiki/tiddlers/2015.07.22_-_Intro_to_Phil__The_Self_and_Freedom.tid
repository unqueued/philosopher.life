title: 2015.07.22 - Intro to Phil: The Self and Freedom

The Self/Identity/Personhood

    Defines the essential qualities that make one person distinct from all others

    The self is the idea of a unified being which is the source of consciousness.

    This self is the agent responsible for the thoughts and actions of an individual to which they are ascribed.

    The self is thought to be a substance which endures through time; thus, the thoughts and actions at different moments may pertain to the same self.



The Self and Consciousness: Locke, Essay concerning Human Understanding

    Lots of neat little moves in here, but they aren’t terribly important for the lecture. They would add spice and color to an analysis in the paper though.

    A person identity or self endures or persists through time, even if it changes.

        Ship of Theseus.

    What are the conditions for personhood?

    Self = conscious thinking thing, self-reflecting, etc.

        Not tied to the material or immaterial. Doesn’t matter in his view.

            Although, he’s an empiricist. Has a beef with them rationalists.

    We are consciously aware of our persisting identities.

        We are aware of our passage through time.

        We know this because we have memories.

    Self = conscious thinking thing with memories

    Body-Swap thought experiment

        Prince swapped into a cobbler’s body.

    Critiques

        Begging the question

            Embedding your conclusion the premises.

            The criterion proposed by Locke is implicitly circular or begging the question, for the concept of memory presupposes the concept of personal persistence.

                It is a conceptually necessary condition of one mental state m2 being a memory of another mental state m1 that m1 and m2 belong to the same person.

                If I suddenly came to have what appears to me to be a memory of witnessing the Kennedy assassination, which occurred years before I came into existence, this would not be a genuine memory, but a delusion.

            Fixable.

        What if I have a faulty memory?

            How much do I have to remember to still be myself?

        What if I don’t have memories of myself, but of everything else. Isn’t that a self of sorts? Just not like us.

        Does identity come in degrees?







Liberation from the Self: Parfit, Reasons and Persons

    Locke talks about how our past selves are integrated with our present selves. Parfit is concerned with how our present and future selves are integrated.

        Reductionist view.

            Persistent identity simply requires psychological continuity.

            Self might be linked to our body chemistry, but not to our instance of that body chemistry.

        Non-Reductionist view

            A deep fact or condition is required.

    Teletransportation

        Star Trek transporter? Record the exact configuration of your atoms, destroy them on Earth, and simultaneously remake that configuration on Mars.

            Is this you or just a copy of you?

        Non-reductionist thinks that it is a copy. That there is a deeper fact about who you are embedded on the Earth you that isn’t found in or about the Mars copy.

            The non-reductionist prefers to travel by spacecraft instead to maintain his identity/self.

    Future Selves

        When you do something stupid for instant gratification, you don’t consider future you to really be you. You don’t care about future you.

            When you’re about to binge on 10 shots of vodka, you don’t care about future you, possibly.

    Caring about Death further as non-reductionist

        Why does his reductionist view make him feel better?

        Maybe a calm to just accepting that there is nothing after we die. I don’t know.

            Skepticism seems to do that sometimes…goes either down a deep, dark path of sadness or towards no longer having to care, a feeling of freedom.

            I understand this skepticism existential problem, but don’t quite see how it really plays out here or why it has the force he thinks it does. I guess what he saw as a problem for him isn’t so much a problem for me.

    Egoist’s Future

        Narcissistic. Solely devoted to the self. Whatever the conditions of the self are for the egoist, those are the bare conditions of self.

        Simple answers to the question of how the present Egoist sees his relation to future beings which might be his future selves:

            R = a psychological connectness and/or continuity with the right kind of cause.

            1 – Physical Continuity

                Williams’ Surgeon Example:

                    Surgery will painless operate, but the result is a being whose life is worse than not living (torturous). Note that the future being is not R-related to the pre-operation egoist.

                    Does the egoist care about the future being?

                        If so, then the egoist thinks that is his future self.

                        Parfit thinks physical continuity isn’t sufficient for Continuity of the Self, and hence the egoist wouldn’t care.

                            Transplants, other bodies, etc. Body isn’t sufficient enough.

                                Parfit thinks it isn’t even necessary!

                Brain is the carrier of R. It must have continuity.

                    But, in this example, brain incontinuity doesn’t make the Egoist care about the future self.

            2 – Relation R with its normal cause

                Parts of the argument have been cut out…=/

                Can’t be defended either, apparently.

                Embedded in “normal” cause here is basically the physical continuity.

            3 – R with any reliable cause

                Let’s say you accept Teletransportion Replicas as being You.

                    Imagine Teletransportation only worked 1% of the time. It wasn’t reliable.

                    Does it matter that you were almost “accidentally” replicated?

                        Does it have any outcome as to whether or not that replica is you? Is it a Deep fact?

                        No, according to Parfit.

            4 – R with any cause.

                That’s all that continuity is. Nothing special. Can be accidental. It isn’t physical.







Freedom/Autonomy/Personhood

    Freewill

        Compatibilism and Libertarianism

            Robots and Dice

        Determinism, Fatalism, Foreknowledge


Autonomy

    Contemporary views of autonomy generally hinge upon three fundamental concepts of self-governing:

        Sovereignty

            Sovereignty might be thought of as political autonomy. It deals in various kinds of freedom, whether freedom as non-frustration from impediments (be they man-made or natural) as with Hobbes and Mill, freedom as non-interference from agent-driven hindrances as with Berlin and Nozick, or even freedom as non-domination as with Petit.

            By sovereignty, we speak of physical, political, and social self-rule.

            Autonomy based on sovereignty is concerned with coercion, socio-economic status and opportunity, self-ownership, etc.

                For example, when someone puts a gun to your head and tells you to jump, you seem to have a choice about whether or not you will jump in a significant sense, and yet you seem forced to jump (lacking a choice) in another substantial sense.

                    This latter sense, essentially coercion, is a violation of the sovereignty.

            Sovereignty is a capacity to govern oneself in the most obvious and literal sense: self-governing as political self-governing.

            Lastly, sovereignty seems to be a set of sociopolitical goals and rights we seek.

                For example, children eventually want to make life decisions for themselves; people don’t want a government suppressing their free speech; and, no one wants a gun pointed at his head.

        Authenticity

            Colloquially, we refer to authenticity when we talk about “keeping it real,” or “frontin’,” or “being true to yourself.”

            When a person isn’t being authentic, he is thought to lack autonomy.

            The central problem of authenticity is figuring out how to differentiate our authentic desires and beliefs from inauthentic ones.

                For example, a person profoundly manipulated by hypnosis may be furnished with inauthentic desires which aren’t a genuine part of the authentic self of that agent, and acting upon those desires would demonstrate a lack of autonomy.

                Further, depression, drug-use, systematic conditioning, etc. are often considered autonomy-defeaters in authenticity-based models of autonomy.

            We must ask: who is the ‘real you’? There are many routes to answer this question.

                Authenticity-based autonomy may or may not be a capacity, depending on which model is considered.

                Authenticity, however, is certainly a goal.

                We want to be ourselves, and we want to be governed primarily by our authentic selves.

                It is unclear how authenticity plays a role in our rights other than pointing out “who” we assign rights or duties to.

        Accountability

            Autonomy, in this light, is an explanation of whatever it is about us that makes us morally responsible agents.

            Generally, the requirements of accountability include rationality, consciousness, self-reflection, etc.

                In addition to these requirements, some concept of “choice” is the vital accountability-making ingredient to our autonomy.

                For the libertarian, choice originates in an agent’s free will.

                For the compatibilist, choice is just doing what you want to do.

                In both cases, autonomy requires an agent to be free from external forces (insofar as that is possible) and to be bound only by one’s self in making choices.

            In contrast to sovereignty, this concept is wrapped up in the metaphysics of self-governing, describing choice at a more fundamental level.

                Taking the gun example, whether or not you will jump is ultimately still ‘up to you’.

                    You may get shot for choosing not to jump, but that is your accountability-making choice.

            Models of autonomy which focus upon accountability are primarily concerned with the capacity to choose between right and wrong.

            Further, being a moral agent, being accountable for one’s choices, and making choices that matter, is a goal.

            Life is meaningful because we are accountable – nothing really matters without this capacity. Again, it is ordinarily thought that our moral obligations and rights exist in virtue of accountability-making autonomy.

    Consider the case of Free Speech

        Sovereignty – a political right to say what you want

            Or without that freedom, you are held accountable, not morally, but legally for censoring yourself.

        Authenticity – a capacity to say what YOU really want to say

            Might be politically prevented from such a thing

        Accountability – a moral capacity or right to say what you want to say

            Maybe you’ll have a legal right to say something, but you morally should not.

        Note the Legal/Moral distinction.



Freedom to Do What We Want: Hobbes, Liberty, Necessity and Chance

    Hobbes is fighting against J.D.’s view of freedom and requiring a kind of libertarian freewill almost.

        Freedom for Hobbes is incredibly simple. It’s the ability to do what you want to do. When you can and do, then you are free, but not otherwise.

            Whatever you in fact do, then, you’ve done freely on Hobbes’ view, by definition.

        Weak fucking freedom, I tell ya’ what.

        Blame is appropriate because it is useful for modifying people’s behaviors, but maybe not because it is “deserved.”

        Hobbes had a very low view of people, imho.

    Berlin calls this “Negative freedom” – I’ll be considering Hobbes through Berlin’s eyes.

        Hobbes and Mill believed (or are often thought to have believed) that freedom is largely a matter of non-frustration – of being able to do what you want to do.

    Hobbes: “A free man is he that, in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindered to do what he has a will to do.”

        It’s not clear how to interpret this, but Hobbes is often interpreted as holding the view that you’re free insofar as your preferred option is accessible.

    Critiques

        Hobbes’s view (on at least one interpretation) makes no mention of the restricting actions of others. On his view, any hindrance detracts from your freedom.

            Berlin, however, thinks that the hindrance has to be man-made and intentional. Mere inability, he thinks, doesn’t make you less free. Coercion, he notes, implies the deliberate interference of human beings within the area in which one could otherwise act. This view is fairly widespread.

        On Hobbes’s view, as long as your preferred option is available you are free, even if no other options are available.

            Unlike Hobbes, Berlin thinks that you lose freedom if others prevent you from doing what you could have done, or what you might have wanted to do, and not merely what you actually wanted to do.

            For Berlin, your options are like doors. How extensive your choice is depends on how many doors there are. How significant the choice is depends on what the doors lead to. And how free the choice is depends on whether and the extent to which the doors are closed because of the actions of others.

        On Hobbes’s view, it seems that you can enhance your freedom by adapting your desires to your circumstances.

            Berlin thinks this isn’t possible – one cannot make oneself freer in this way. To think otherwise, he thinks, is to confuse freedom with desire fulfillment.

        Berlin’s Response:

            Berlin, then, rejects the idea of freedom as non-frustration and opts instead for the idea of freedom as non-interference. Freedom, he thinks, requires that every option be accessible in that it isn’t blocked or obscured by the (deliberate?) actions of others.

            We could, however, insist on an even more muscular conception of freedom – freedom as non-domination – according to which every door must be open and there must not be any doorkeepers with the power to close them.

            On the options view, your freedom depends on the number and quality of your options. The more options you have, and the more desirable they are, the freer you are. On this view, anything that limits either the number or quality of your options limits your freedom, whether it’s other people, nature, or your own inadequacies.

    Berlin’s Positive Freedom:

        You’re free in the negative sense, thinks Berlin, insofar as no one interferes with your activities. You’re free in the positive sense to the extent that you’re governed by your true self.

        Autonomy, on this view, is a kind of self-mastery, which you achieve by taming the demons within. Clearly this view requires a way to distinguish between those internal elements that are “demons” – that are alien to you – and those that are genuinely your own. Traditionally, the concept of rationality has played a key role in drawing that distinction.

        The thought is that the real you is the rational you, and that you are self-governing when you are ruled not by your passions but by the rational side of your nature.





Determinism and Our Attitudes to Others: Strawson, Freedom and Resentment

    A different direction, but it’s really just compatibilism. He’s trying to juice the intuitions of the incompatibilist in the other direction.

    Strawson thinks it isn’t practically (although it is conceptually) possible that humans would abandon inter-personal relationships, reactive attitudes, and responses just because we might be determined.

        He’s arguing for compatibilism.

        Note, this doesn’t make the move not to abandon rational.

            What happens vs. what could happen or what should happens are different things.

            But, that might be Strawson’s point. This isn’t a rational issue.

                The answer may require more than intellectual analysis.

                    Is he doing philosophy?

    3 questions

        What are the causes of reactive attitudes?

            Compatibilists and incompatibilists should be worried about this.

                Incompatibilists needs a causal story to explain it choice.

                Compatibilists need a causal story which shows we aren’t coerced.

            Strawson says he doesn’t care. He surely does. He just doesn’t think this is the real question for autonomy, I guess?

        Under what conditions are reactive attitudes natural/rational/appropriate?

            Somewhat concerned.

        What is it like to have reactive attitudes?

            Most concerned.

    Intuitionism?

    Resentment example

        Modifying feelings of resentment, 2 kinds:

            1) He didn’t know, he didn’t mean to, he couldn’t help it…etc.

                He isn’t morally responsible

            2) second king has two subgroups:

                He wasn’t himself, he was hypnotized or perverted systematically, etc.

                    Not really morally responsible because it wasn’t him!

                The agent was himself, but was warped or deranged?

                    He doesn’t give examples, but he needs to!

        This second subgroup is designed to show us a distinction between the range of subjective attitudes/human interactions and the objective attitudes.

            These are supposed to be opposed to each other.

                Maybe for humans. Is it in all cases though? I don’t think so.

                    What about crazy simple cases? The subjective and objective might match.

            Strawson thinks the objective stance can’t have reactive attitudes embedded in it.

                Why should we agree?

    Strawson seems to “raise” the status of the participant reactive attitudes.

        Why should we agree to this?

        I think a lot of people’s attitudes are fundamentally irrational.

        What I like about the objective is that it is true for everyone. That it isn’t whimsical or subjective. That it isn’t relative. That it is right beyond feelings. It is reason.

    What if determinism were true?

        Well, you’d have to react the way you did. And, presumably, if you’ve been reacting all along, then you’ll continue reacting. You’ll be determined to do so.

        It feels like the end for objective attitudes once discovered. But, I think reactive attitudes also change with this knowledge/discovery as well.

            Is it the end of reactive attitudes? For some people, maybe, yeah.

                Some people are very in touch with their objective attitude.

    Humans just can’t be objective. We’re human.

        But, from my point of view, that’s just the same thing as saying it’s all subjective. It’s absurd to worry about anything objective. We’re absurd beings just be definition (not just fallible).

        He doesn’t think this absurdity arises, however. That seems odd to me.

    Ultimately, even if Strawson is correct in claiming that someone who believed in determinism wouldn’t give up their reactive attitudes or moral life doesn’t mean that the person is being rational.

        Strawson is saying “what is,” but not “what ought.” He needs to talk about what ought here.





Parfit

Robots, freedom, whenever we would do the wrong thing, it changes our mind.



Frankfurt

Frankfurt doesn’t focus on political conceptions of Freedom (as in the tradition of Hobbes and Berlin), instead Frankfurt argues for a particular sort of freedom by modeling the authentic identity of persons. The fundamental question at stake is: Who is the “real” you?

Many famous philosophers have defined the real you as the rational you. In contrast, Frankfurt thinks the real you is the hierarchically integrated you, a ‘congruence between’ and an ‘identification with’ or ‘endorsement of’ your desires, which is less about rationality and more concerned the structure of your will.

As persons, we are self-reflective and we are not indifferent to which desires move us. On this view, we form desires about our desires, and our capacity to endorse our desires is what grounds our personhood, our freedom of the will, and our autonomy.

We start with first-order (FO) desires; these are ordinary desires about the world. E.g. I want to eat pizza; I desire sleep; I want cocaine; etc. Every creature with desires has FO desires, and hence FO desires aren’t very special. FO desires vary in strength, and for example, we might think that without any intervention, the strongest desire is what moves us, it is our will. E.g. If the honey badger desires food more than sleep, he’ll be effectively moved to pursue food instead of sleep – that is his (not free) will.

Naively, second-order (SO) desires are desires about FO desires. E.g. I desire not to want to eat pizza; I want to desire sleep; I don’t want to want cocaine; etc. Note that my SO desires can conflict with my FO desires. SO desires are found in creatures with more complex psychologies.

Frankfurt further distinguishes SO desires from SO volitions (where SO volitions are a subset of SO desires). A SO volition is a special kind of SO desire. A SO volition is a desire that some FO desire be or not be your will. A SO volition is a desire for some FO desire to take or lose priority over all other FO desires, such that you will be effectively moved or not moved to act upon some FO desire. A SO volition is the reflective endorsement or repudiation of a FO desire.

The capacity for and the use of SO volitions is the significant and necessary condition for a creature to be a person. Creatures, including humans, who lack SO volitions (even if they have mere SO desires) are called wantons - they are not persons. Lacking free will is not a problem for wantons, as seen in the case of the wanton addict. On Frankfurt’s theory, a wanton is exclusively moved by desires he has not identified himself with, endorsed, approved, or made his will. He is not a person because he is merely a being with desires that rule him, and he does not care to or perhaps even have the ability to rule over his desires.

In contrast to a wanton, a person, such as the unwilling addict, has SO volitions. Whether or not those SO volitions ultimately “win out” determines whether or not a person has freedom of the will.

When your FO desire and SO volition conflict, and if and when you are moved by a FO desire which you repudiate via a SO volition, you are not acting autonomously or authentically, and essentially, as a person, you lack freedom of the will. Significantly, even though you are moved to act by a FO desire that is in some sense ‘your desire’, because that FO desire overrides your SO volition, it seems as though you are forced to act upon a desire which isn’t really yours – you didn’t endorse that FO desire, in fact, the real you repudiated it. That FO desire which moved you, against your SO volition, is alien to you. The real you is a helpless bystander to the force of the external, inauthentic FO desire. To be authentic, to have freedom of the will, your SO volition must effectively make your FO desire your will.

Lastly, Frankfurt’s theory is not actually confined to only two orders of desires. There are third-order desires and volitions, fourth, fifth, and so on. E.g. I can want to want to want pizza, etc. Ultimately, the necessary condition of personhood and autonomy is some sort of capacity to identify ourselves with what we “really want to want to want…to want, and so on,” a capacity to decisively align our many orders of desires in a resounding commitment, securing conformity between them, and forcibly synchronizing and unifying them (Christine Korsgaard must love this). Unfortunately, Frankfurt does not provide a clear argument about this. This is one of the fuzzier and least clear aspects of Frankfurt’s theory, despite it being the most important aspect of his theory (it does all the magical work for him).

Interesting characteristics of this theory:

    A focus upon self-reflection, evaluation, endorsement, authenticity, and ordered desires fits many of our intuitions on the topic of free will and autonomy. Something about the theory seems right.

    It does not require robust metaphysical commitments. The theory sits comfortably in naturalistic philosophical perspectives.

    The theory is neutral to determinism, and can work as a compatibilist view of freewill. (Although, it is not necessarily inconsistent with incompatibilism.)

        Compatibilism is the belief that free will and determinism are compatible ideas, where freedom, in this case, turns out to be something like just doing what you want to do, or willing what you want to will, which is distinct from other standard definitions of freewill, such as: “The ability to do otherwise.”

        Incompatibilists think that this kind of freedom isn’t enough, and they worry that if we are merely deterministic flesh bags of chemicals and electrical signals, then we are no better than any other determined or programmed object. On such a view, we are reducible to a mere mass of determined particles. Why are we any better than complex robots? Why is compatibilist free will actually freedom at all; and why is it worth having? Why would we be morally responsible if we are determined? So, the incompatibilist who believes we are morally responsible must claim we aren’t fully determined and that we have a kind of libertarian, metaphysically based freewill which overcomes the laws of physics. Draw a homunculus.

        Compatibilists will respond by claiming that libertarian freewill is incoherent; that libertarians have failed to provide any suitable account of how it works. The metaphysical commitments are too great for the compatibilist. Further, why are we any better than a random number generator or dice? Why is libertarian freedom worth having?

    The account is content-neutral. Persons aren’t required to have particular values. This sits in stark contrast to other classic theories of autonomy, freedom, and authenticity.

        This feature is powerful. It has some good aspects to it, but it also may have bring with it some problems which I don’t have time to go into.

3 Sets of Problems with this account:

    Manipulation. Frankfurt’s account of freedom and autonomy does not take into consideration ‘where a desire came from’ or ‘how it was acquired.’ It can’t explain manipulation-based autonomy defeaters such as the problems of poisoned origins or a neuroscientist re-engineering a person’s desires and beliefs.

        One paradigm case of manipulation is where a neuroscientist radically alters your desires (and beliefs). For ahistorical accounts of autonomy and freedom, like Frankfurt’s, as long as the neuroscientist changes you such that a kind of congruence between your FO and higher order desires is maintained, then you are still considered to be autonomous. Frankfurt’s account doesn’t seem capable of taking into account how the problem of manipulation, at least intuitively, results in an attack on or elimination of one’s autonomy and/or the authentic self.

        Don’t we want a theory of autonomy that allows us to reclaim autonomy from our checkered/conditioned past?

    Trilemma: Ab Initio, Infinite Regress, Incompleteness (Christman on Dworkin [who is Frankfurtian])

        Ab Initio/Problem of Authority – How can non-autonomous processes or higher order desires confer autonomy upon lower level desires? How does a particular second-order desire really have the authority to speak for us? Why that one?

            When a SO volition endorses a FO desire, we take that FO desire to be an authentic desire, a desire of the agent himself, because the agent had to actually endorse it. Initially, it seems as if SO volitions have the power to speak for the authentic self. The problem, however, is that a SO volition needs to be an autonomous desire as well, a desire that really belongs to the authentic agent. If a SO volition is not an autonomous desire, then it seems as if a non-autonomous force is ‘endorsing’ a FO desire, and then it would not appear as if the FO desire is really endorsed by an autonomous agent. How can autonomy arise from non-autonomy? It doesn’t seem like it can. So, what makes a SO volition an autonomous desire? This brings us to the…

        Infinite Regress. - If SO volitions are made autonomous by TO volitions in the same way that FO desires are made autonomous by SO volitions, then we hit the regress problem, whereby we pile desires on top of desires.

            The argument is that in order to make an N-order desire autonomous, an autonomous N+1-order volition must endorse it. To have an autonomous SO volition requires an autonomous TO volition endorsing it. But, clearly, we can ask the same question about TO volitions, and the answer requires having an autonomous volition from the next higher order endorsing it. This process of trying to autonomize desires with higher order autonomous desires can continue ad infinitum, hence the regress.

        Incompleteness – If we are to escape the Ab Initio problem without falling into the regress, we have explain how SO volitions are autonomous desires in a way that is different from how SO volitions make FO desires autonomous. Nobody seems to be able to give an explanation, hence the “incompleteness” problem. Which is basically the same thing as saying, we really don’t have an explanation at all.

        Summary: On Frankfurt’s model, we must ask if the relevant SO volitions themselves are autonomous. If not, then we have the ab initio problem. If so, then how do they become autonomous? If it’s in the same way as one’s first-order desires, then we face a regress. But if they become autonomous in some other way, then Frankfurt’s theory is incomplete because he hasn’t specified the method. He does anticipate the trilemma; he talks about decisively aligning, securing conformity between, or unifying our many orders of desires, but he never really explains how this works. Hence, Frankfurt’s model is incomplete.

    Perhaps you don’t find Frankfurt’s argument intuitively compelling. You should ask: Why is Frankfurt’s freedom of the will worth having? How is a person in this account any more worthy or better off than other animals and wantons? Why does it produce moral responsibility or the kind of agency that matters?

Daniel Wegner

Daniel Wegner argues the conscious will isn’t the cause of action. On his view, people everywhere mistakenly interpret their conscious thoughts as being causally relevant to their actions. In his writing, he attempts to dismantle the commonly held belief and experience of a direct causal connection between one’s conscious thoughts and actions. Ultimately, he believes the conscious will is epiphenomenal. Consciousness is a secondary phenomenon that occurs alongside (about 3 seconds after) the primary phenomenon (whatever is actually controlling our actions).

Wegner describes conscious will as an experience, feeling, or perception. The experience of conscious will spans from a conscious thought or intention to the appearance of a causal path to the target action. In Wegner’s view, the supposed causal link between the conscious thought and the action is illusory, and he claims both thought and action are caused by unconscious mechanisms.

Why are we mistaken? Why do we wrongfully interpret our experiences and erroneously infer causation? Sometimes we perceive patterns and causation where there are none, and Wegner seems to think this is the case with the conscious will. Our flawed ability to recognize causation seems to be a significant reason why we have the experience of conscious will at all. When conscious thoughts or intentions precede and match the target action in a timely, exclusive, compatible, and consistent manner, we mistakenly infer, via our flawed causal recognition, that our conscious will was the cause of the action.

Wegner thinks a potential link between thought and action is weakened by the involuntary nature of examples such as motor automatisms, hypnosis, dowsing, action projection, and psychological disorders such as schizophrenia, where in these cases one does not experience conscious will but still demonstrates many of the scientific signs of it. In these cases, the person acting does not feel he is making a conscious decision to act, but feels as though some external force is causing the action through him – that is, there is a separation between the action taken by the person and his conscious thought or desires; the link between conscious thought and action isn’t there when we would expect it to be.

Further, Wegner uses an experiment, the “I Spy” study, to demonstrate how the experience of conscious will can be artificially created. Wegner’s experiment seems to build off and extend from Libet’s studies, which attempted to reveal how unconscious mechanisms played a major causal role in the appearance of voluntary action. Wegner employs both positions as evidence for the thesis that the experience of conscious will is an illusion, where conscious thoughts are inefficacious and do not cause our actions (despite all appearances).

The purpose of the “I Spy” study was to “lead people to experience willful action when in fact they have done nothing.” This was a digital 2-player Ouiji board version of I Spy (using a mouse), where the participant was primed with words about items on the screen, forced onto certain objects by a confederate, and required to “rate each stop they made for personal intentionality.” The point of the study was to generate cases where participants artificially felt as though they consciously willed an action, when in fact, they did not cause the action. Word priming “did not cause participants to stop on the items.” Word priming did, however, conjure thoughts about the related objects on the screen, and when forced upon these objects in brief time frames after priming (1 or 5 seconds), participants “reported having performed this movement intentionally.”

The experiment shows that one can have conscious thoughts which don’t cause action yet still form the illusion of an experience of conscious will. The involuntary examples demonstrate that one can have conscious thoughts which meet many of the matching parameters of target actions, but don’t result in the experience of conscious will. Together, both positions, in Wegner’s view, demonstrate how the apparent causal link between consciousness and action is an illusion.

Wegner claims the experience of conscious will serves to provide us a preview of what we may do, but “the real causal mechanisms underlying behavior are never present in consciousness. Rather, the engines of causation are unconscious mechanisms of mind.” It remains unclear why this ability to preview matters.



A Couple Implications. What’s at Stake?

If Wegner, like many psychologists, is right in thinking the conscious will can be reduced to deterministic, physical mechanisms, then the game is likely over for incompatibilists. We might initially think science is the wrong domain for proving we don’t have free will (which requires substantial metaphysics). Presumably, free will is part of having conscious will. If the experience of conscious will can be entirely reduced to mere physical mechanisms, if this phenomenon is best explained in naturalistic terms, then either incompatibilists should deny free agency or the burden of proof seems to be shifted to the libertarian.

Compatibilists (and incompatibilists as well) remain vulnerable to Wegner’s argument in a different way. If Wegner is right in thinking that conscious will is entirely an illusion, and if conscious thought does not cause action, then it is very hard to see how humans could engage in any sort of meaningful deliberation and choice necessary (even by compatibilist standards) for being moral agents. In essence, Wegner’s argument seems to reduce us down to mere observers of the results of our unconscious mechanisms. If he is right, then I don’t see why morality and moral responsibility should have any rational relevance to us. We can’t actually participate in moral life; moral life is an illusion.
