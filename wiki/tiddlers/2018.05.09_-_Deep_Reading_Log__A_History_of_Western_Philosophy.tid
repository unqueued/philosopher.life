title: 2018.05.09 - Deep Reading Log: A History of Western Philosophy

Russell covers another French philosopher I don't know. I was not impressed by his arguments, so it doesn't matter.

Russell left most of his own opinions to the end. I can't say I agree with him. But, I appreciate his point of view.
