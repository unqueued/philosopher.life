title: 2018.08.12 - Weekly TDL: Meat on Bones

* Put meat on the [[Root]] directories of kids' wikis.
** I want them to have something they can continually work on. 
** Eventually, this is where I want them to spend their Saturday 1-hour wiki chorework.
* Finish [[Jesus Among Secular Gods]] and my letter to [[AA&UJ]]
* Read the core rules of DND with the kids
* Give 1 hour each day to the music collection
