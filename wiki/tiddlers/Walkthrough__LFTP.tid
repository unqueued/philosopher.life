title: Walkthrough: LFTP

This is simply the fastest clean tool out there.

Login:

`lftp sftp://user@domain:port`

Set your local download directory.

`lcd /foo/bar`

Navigate to where you want. 

Download single file in 5 segments:

`pget -n 5 foobar.avi`

Download a directory, 5 files at time with 10 segments per file (that is 50 simultaneous threads):

`mirror -P 5 --use-pget-n=10 FoobarDir`
