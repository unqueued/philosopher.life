title: 2018.10.18 - Prompted Introspection: Best Friend as Stranger

!! Write about your best friend as if they were a stranger.

You know, it's annoying to see such a good previous answer, [[2017.12.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Best Friend as Stranger]], and feeling like there's no good way to top myself, lol.

She's a librarian, and you would know it just by looking at her. After 10 minutes talking with her, you could probably guess librarian or professor. She's a bit hippie, Catholic anglophilic, loves awful TV braincandy, has read you under the table, genius verbal IQ, can hold a conversation with anyone, introverted, empathic, should never climb trees (and should know better by now), a ridiculous pain tolerance or hypersensitivity with nothing in between, steampunk before it was cool, curly hair, easily embarrassed or tickled by me (but not others), perfectionist, refuses to write unless she can do it in one sweep, crafty, far too optimistic about humanity, incredibly charitable, devoted to existentialism and contemplation, often tired, stressed, overworked, gives everything she has to her family, incredibly patient with her obsessive husband, burned alive, understands suffering as providing an opportunity for generating meaning, socialist, has all the markers of growing up poor, aspie, mini-hoarder, messy private desk but ordered public desk, deeply concerned with education and information access, reminds me of Jesus (but much better tits), and she's the best person I've ever met.
