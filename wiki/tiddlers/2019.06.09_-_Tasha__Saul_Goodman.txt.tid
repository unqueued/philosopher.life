Sounds fun ! Yea we have rested Matthew worked yesterday so that’s all we did - Esteban and I got up and touched up groceries for the next week. (Even though we still have to run up tomorrow for a few things that are just over priced where we went today). Just finished cleaning about to put some chicken &  corn on the grill and cheddar biscuits in the oven :slightly_smiling_face: and start our shows. We usually run behind in our days cause we work nights lol :woman-shrugging: it’s weird but it works
