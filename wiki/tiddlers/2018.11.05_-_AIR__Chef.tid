I was wrong. I think this is info you need.  

I thought [[AA]] had not invited me to thanksgiving in the past years but in 2016 she did.
MON 12:13 PM
“We are doing Thanksgiving again with [[K]]’s family at the church. If you aren’t busy or have no plans, we would love to see you!!!”
MON 12:13 PM
That is what she said
MON 12:14 PM
We are meeting for “Christmas at 3 at the church--let me know if you need  a ride or anything :relaxed::two_hearts:”
MON 12:14 PM
She also sent this.
MON 12:14 PM
I was drinking very heavily during this time. And didn’t respond.
MON 12:16 PM
I don’t know what this will do for you/us but I see it as a better indication

My brother's chef is a complete asshole. My brother puts up with a lot. He is looking for a backup plan for his job. My bro talked with Miracle. I think they made up.

It sounds like my brother is still worried about making connections with people, and I understand that.

We talked about meeting Brad.

We talked about the wikis. 

I'm having a hard time remembering everything we talked about!
