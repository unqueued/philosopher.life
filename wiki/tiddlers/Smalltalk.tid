title: Smalltalk

I fucking hate smalltalk. Smalltalk is sometimes a language game in which we casually, openly, and immorally-civilly create spaces for dishonesty necessary to hide from an opponent how much we really don't give a shit about them (which is radically different from saying we don't agree with them). It is a game which allows us to appear to like someone without giving away the fact that we don't love them.

Don't get me wrong: Kant is straight up wrong about the axe-murderer at your doorstep. You better fucking lie to the dark-triad when it is morally required of you; that's the [[T42T]] rule-of-thumb. If you don't have [[salient]], openly defensible positions deviating from what is obviously [[T42T]], if can't spend your social capital sacrificially for the [[other]] (thus, from duty), then you probably don't have justification to lie. Smalltalk is generally not universalizable, imho.

[[k0sh3k]]'s notes:

There are those who will find you intimidating b/c you don't play the social niceties - especially, that you don't shut your mouth when you think they are doing something morally wrong or are saying something hypocritical/unfounded, because it's socially expected that you would not confront someone directly unless your intention is attack on their person.

I don't play social nicety games for the sake of being nice. I aim to be kind regardless of niceness; niceness is [[FO]], and kindness is [[SO]] over those desires and beliefs (into [[infinigress]]ive faith on the Frankfurtian model).
