title: 2018.07.10 - CATI: Observe

It has bothered me since I was a child to be told that events at a subatomic level are affected by whether there is an observing mind. I still can't wrap my fucking mind around it. It's unintuitive, like I can't really really observe the metanarratival and metaphysical nature of such a thing in this overarching sense. 

It does appear consciousness might be that fucking super special, but it might not. Panpsychism and OOO seem capable of converting every kind of object into a subject related in light-cone and beyond to all the other objects. Causation is induced, and we cause to be a particular way in trying to induce it.
