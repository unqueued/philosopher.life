title: Intelligence

I like being in the place, in the state of mind, where I don't have to inspect my intelligence with any pride. I am a box (an organic, not very clean, geometrically tuned creature with many...). I see it as a machinery to get things done. How can I harness that engine to rebuild itself while grinding through the world of thought? I'm just a finite creature living in a set of specifications. What are my requirements?
