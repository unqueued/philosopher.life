**  I had briefly considered a PhD in CS, and formal verification was exactly what I was looking at. The professor I was going to work with had some modal logic thing going on as well, IIRC. Glad I chose philosophy.

** As a colorblind person, I am fascinated by the issue of how others think, perceive, and talk about color. Qualia and even the way in which language itself shapes our ability to perceive is not lost on me. As someone who is consistently facing the inability to perceive what others do, I must understand why.

**MBTI is deeply flawed. It's not scientific. I am still convinced there is something to it. Does that mean I have faith? I want to rid myself of beliefs for which I have insufficient evidence. I still feel like I have evidence for some kernel in the MBTI that makes me think it does some kind of real work beyond Astrology, Horoscopes, and Cold-reading.

** I don't know this publication. It looks bad. I'm not a fan of Monsanto (not for the usual stupid reasons though). There may be something here as well.

** Well-said. 
** I could never be a politician. 
** Also, I hate almost everyone. 
** I question what counts as left to these people. I am not convinced I meet many leftists at all. I'm betting the lines were very poorly drawn.
