* Woke at 8:30
** 25mg Diphenhydramine last night, and I'm still feeling it this morning. I'm not used to it. Still itchy though (hrmmm).
* Went with wife to fill out paperwork at the doctor's
* Threw away le table. Goodbye. 
** Hey, I used it a couple times. Lol. It helped me build our custom ghetto bed.
** I wish I could have given it to my brother. He would have really used it.
** Kids helped me take it apart and pitch it. My son gopher's tools well, but we still need to work on safety. It was, for the most part, enjoyable working with them.
* Read+Write 
* Work
* Walk with my wife
** Ran into Gary. We talked about environmentalism. The man dropped f-bombs with me, which is quite rare with him. Neat. I'm cool now.
* Meds for wife
* Pizza and beer!
* Watched Superstore
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 11:30
