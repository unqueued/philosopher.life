I spent far too much time last night trying to get Manjaro to even boot. I actually started by trying to make LUKS work. That failed tremendously, and I eventually whittled my way down to just even getting anything to work. Even the automated partitioning configs didn't work.

I thought I was going crazy. I DD'd a copy of ubuntu to the same thumb drive and installed. Voila. Done. So, I know it has to be something with the manjaro installation liveusb. DD'd back to manjaro. 

It has sent me down a rabbithole this morning. I know I have Legacy BIOS setup correctly. Doing BIOS/MBR installs, and nothing is booting.

Checking to make sure grub is installed from my live USB.

```
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt /dev/sda
sudo reboot
```

Seems like it should work. 

Setting bios-mbr and grub flags during the manual partitioning finally did it. Unfortunately, I don't have LUKS. I expect full disk encryption on all my mobile devices. This is unacceptable to me. Reinstalled, root is not encrypted, but /home is. That's far from ideal, but it is a lot better than nothing.

Resilio, Synkron, Dropbox, and SSH I'll set up for her. She can do the rest. 

Picked up a PSU. This MIGHT be the fix. It would be the cheap one, and it never hurts to have an extra one for testing anyways.

Setup seedbox script to sync to m10 for now. Will need to put up NFS share for high-speed streaming to the Chromebook I'll be putting up as a temporary replacement for HTPC.
