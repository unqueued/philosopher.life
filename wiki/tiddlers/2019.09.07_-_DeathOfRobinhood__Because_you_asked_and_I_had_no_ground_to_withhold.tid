title: 2019.09.07 - DeathOfRobinhood: Because you asked and I had no ground to withhold

Hi h0p3,

Selah and I met last October. She had come to my church during a weekday event to check it out for her brother, who was looking for a place that had services in the late afternoon. Everyone had gone out for a supper break together, while I slunk down to the basement because I needed to pray.

I was just coming out of a depression triggered by my dad's death, coping with both my mom's health problems and some issues of my own, compounded by semi-isolation. I'd been in and out of a couple of confusing relationships that, in hindsight, I was not in the proper headspace to pursue.

In the basement, I told God that I was lonely. I wasn't asking for anything, but my understanding of prayer is that it creates a space in which I can say true things, including about myself.

Back upstairs there were a handful of people still hanging out. I asked one guy if he wanted to go eat and we went to a hole in the wall nearby. While we were ordering, Selah walked by, saw us from the window, and came in. Turns out she knew my friend from childhood and wanted to say hi. We talked a bit, and later that night we prayed together for this one anxious fellow who had come in off the street. It wasn't the time to ask her out because she was very occupied by her mom's then present hospitalization, but we'd noticed each other, and I thought she was cool.

We went on our first date a month and a half later. She had tried to wash out some of the drool and other work fluids from her shirt before we met which I took as a sign of interest. We've been...very involved with each other since.

♥♥♥

I guess that's my little answered prayer story about that. I've deliberately tried to write it de-frilled and un-mystified, though I can't fully avoid my tendency to assign narrative significance to life events.

Today I got news of a death. We met on the train during the years I'd moved back to take care of my mom. His life seemed the sort of bleak, absurd thing written by some godless tragedist. He wasn't objectively likeable, but we became friends. I'm glad we got a few years together.

This week I was assaulted by my neighbour. I've lived above her for close to a year now. I know she's very lonely and abuses. Early attempts at friendship were rebuffed and now she hates me. I'd like for her to be happy. The first time I'd prayed for her was a month after I'd moved in. I asked God for an opportunity to show her kindness. Later that evening I found her drunk out of her mind at the front door. She'd lost her keys. After searching the neighbourhood in the dark, we found the keys in her purse. When she was sober the next day, she thanked me with a McDonald's gift card. I'd thought it would be the beginning of a good neighbourly relationship, so there's a part of me that feels like I'd failed her by not following up with greater regularity and caring (although I recognize I can't be wholly responsible for her sour outlook on life). 

Anyway, let's do our best to love people, and to love God. We bear His Image, which means we function as the expressed loci of His will.
