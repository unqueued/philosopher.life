That key will enable us to sync a directory between our machines. So, I can put files in that directory and they automatically transfer to you (and vice versa). It's decentralized, encrypted, and fast.

Let me know if you want anything. I'm happy to get whatever I can for you.

So I just go to that web and put in what you sent me

Sweet man I will let you know thanks !

That's just a link to the software you would install. The key will be used to join a sync-swarm (our personal swarm...but you can use as many devices as you want...they will all sync).

Not a problem. Share it with Matthew and Tasha if you want (or I can make individuals syncs for them). I am happy to get yall whatever you want to the best of my ability.

This may sound like a dumb question so if I sync it to my TV you would be able to access it cause that would be awesome!

I am not aware of any TV's that can run Resilio Sync. Do you have Android on it or something?

All this tool does it synchronize files between two or more computers (including phones, laptops, tablets, etc.).

It does not allow me to access what's on your screen or anything outside of that directory. I will not have any privileges on your system except the ability to modify the contents of our shared directory.
