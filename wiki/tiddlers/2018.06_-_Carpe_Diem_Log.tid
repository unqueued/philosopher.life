!! Audit:

* I think the transclusion is a good idea. Should I be doing that on a daily basis? Should I just merge these? I don't know. I see different functions in them as well.
* I feel like I'm triaging and selecting what I really want, at least in the short term. I am worried that I am not engaged in long-term planning. The reflectivity of the this wiki is the right kind of long-term tool, but I definitely don't feel like I'm wielding it wisely enough.
* I see some overlap with [[Wiki Audit]] here and [[Deep Reading Log]]. It's okay that it blends together. I can't get it all perfect.
* My conversations with Charlie tend to be very meaningful to me.  I should reach out to him more often.
** I wish more Christians thought as intelligently as my wife's family. I could live with that.
* Lots of couch->bed nights.
* I was "in the zone" and rabbitholing often enough throughout the month. I had some projects that mattered to me spring out.
* Ghostly conversations which only have "civility" as a way to quiet us from engaging in the real dialectic. It is clear to me that few have the integrity to do what I'm doing here in the wiki. It would break them.
* Sleeping into 9 pretty commonly, but tending towards 8ish hours of sleep.
* We tried some new foods out. Nothing clicked, but I'm glad we did. Also, watermelon has been wonderful!
* I'm very pleased to have the chance to watch KOTH with my children and discuss what matters with them.
* So many dreams this month, very vivid!
* Augmentation has been fulfilling. =)
* Bliss heavy month
* The Letter to R took quite a while to write.
* Not sure why we celebrated father's day, but it was free pie. I'll take it. Father's day is everyday; that's where I need to be.
* I'm glad to have been able to help ALM
** This log is beginning to have serious overlap with others. I've noticed that they are meshing together. 
* We did swim, and I'm glad we did.
* We seem to have done a lot of hotdogs/bratdogs, but this is summer/pool kind of food.
* I've been lucky to connect with many people this month. It's not so lonely in general. I'm very grateful.
* I've noticed that by dinner, I often stop being productive. Is this a mistake?
* I'd like to thank my wife for initiation and being so amenable to me. It's been wonderful.
* I'm really glad I got to know Rebecca better. She is a special human being, and I think she's a beautiful fit to my brother. I hope to call her my sister some day. She's smart and straight up cool. I don't meet many people I respect; she's one. She even hugged me goodbye. I hope I can be of use to her. I know her life is difficult right now. She is intensely quiet, but also truly interested in humanity.
