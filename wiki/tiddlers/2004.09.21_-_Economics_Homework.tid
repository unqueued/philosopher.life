Wealthy parents who give birth to a child with a minor birth defect sell their child to another wealthy but childless family and buy a "perfect" newborn child from a family badly in need of cash.

I find the above transaction disturbing and ridiculous. The value of any person (in the womb, child, elder, etc.) cannot be measured; people are invaluable. “Selling” a person is placing a price/value on a person, thus degrading the status of that person, (they now are not invaluable). I am against any transaction that removes the invaluable status of the person; the above transaction is a crime against humanity. I’m against the death penalty, but I’d truly enjoy laying the smack down on any “consenting adult” that would agree to this nonsense—so yes, I would definitely agree with prohibition of marketing of a person (yes, this has more implications…like “is Hollywood marketing people?” etc.)
