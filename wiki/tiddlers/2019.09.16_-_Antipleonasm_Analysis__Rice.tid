title: 2019.09.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Rice

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
RICE: America first...defines a lot of what you're hearing across the world...what you're hearing in Great Britain with Brexit...the Five Star Movement in Italy...Brazil with...Bolsonaro. So the question is why are we getting this response? And elites can't sit back and say oh you're just wrong. There has to be some self-evaluation of how late-stage capitalism is dealing with some of the new challenges. When you tell the unemployed steelworker in Pennsylvania or the unemployed coal miner in West Virginia, oh I'm sorry globalization really was good for you because you can buy those cheap goods now at Wal-Mart. That message isn't getting through. Perhaps instead you have to think how are we going to actually match the job skills to the jobs that are available in the new economy? What are we going to do about the pressures of automation on low skilled workers?

Uttering the phrase "late-stage capitalism" is not a reliable indicator of actually being opposed to capitalism. I see it wielded by the wealthy as a virtue signal so they can appear like they give a shit, as though they were really paying attention, while not putting their money where their mouths are by refusing to actually consider fundamental shifts away from the centralization of power, particularly regarding exploitation. They would rather enslave and torture the world before giving up their [[power]]; they know it's the end of our species, and they can admit that much. This reminds me of doubletalk spewed from Tucker Carlson. 

Nationalism is a symptom of the problem, yes. She's arguing for bandaids, countermeasures, and throwing bones of false compromises. Oh noes, look, they didn't buy this rhetoric, so now we need to find another way to appease them just enough to get them off our backs before the world ends. These are standard talking points of neoliberals, and they aim to actually avoid a real discussion about capitalism.
