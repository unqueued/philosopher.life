title: 2018.06.12 - Prompted Introspection: Profession

!! What profession would you have chosen, if not your current one?

Probably a computer scientist. I'd make good money, have a lot of fun, and if I had started doing it seriously enough and early enough, I think I could find moral work to do. Unfortunately, it's too easy for me to see the immorality in programming in the world. I've got to be able to live with myself.

I don't rule this possibility out, but right now I have bigger and more immediate fish to fry. Right now, I have to focus on my chillun's educations and just stabilizing our lives. I'm building some skills with future-proofing safety, rounding out my arsenal, and then perhaps I can make different moves. When the Boomers begin to die off (/fingers-crossed), I anticipate parts of the market will open up (although, plenty will disappear for various economical reasons), and I may be able to slip into a new part of the economy riding on much of the rest of my hodge-podge background...plus, I can always plan and work towards it (which may in itself be enough, depending on the circumstances). I should not get my hopes too high for mobility though.
