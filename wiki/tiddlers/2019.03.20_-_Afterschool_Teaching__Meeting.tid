title: 2019.03.20 - Afterschool Teaching: Meeting

Whitney is failing some of her classes, and she's drowning. =( Offered to help her with her math, but I think that's not what she wants (though perhaps what she needs).

New food came in, yay. We needed it. I also need to make sure I'm taking inventory of non-foodstuffs. We are low on bowls. I informed Delp. Apparently, the usage is higher than it has been in years, on his intuitions. Good.

There was a huge faculty meeting today. This forced us into the cafeteria, and we were down to just two people. Whitney took the office. I took the kids. 

I eventually took the older students to a classroom. They were exceptionally well-behaved. Lose enough problem students, and it works out. 

I spoke with 7Cm and 7HM, both star students. They are so quiet, always on the ball. 7Cm was possibly interested in working ahead in mathematics, and 7HM talked with me about books. She told me she's not much of a socializer. Ha. I hear ya. She's reading best-sellers, and she loves stories. I'm going to hunt for books (not my bailiwick, and the kid deserves better). She explained she doesn't come from a background which respects reading; she just does it. What a gem!

The 8th graders and I talked about authority. It is a common topic these days. Rebel wisely, chillun.

My usual cohort came to the library. 5KB and 5BG played chess with me. We did math problems for fun (are these kids feeling okay? awesome). We then talked about emergence and metaphors. We had fun drawing on the digital and whiteboards. 5CC actually only has the veneer; she's snappy, headstrong, and actually doesn't care too much what others think. She masks it well. She's quick too.

Delp came into the library, which contains the police officer's office with all the camera feeds in it. My new student, 5CM, may be in trouble. The amount of liability in this place is palpable. Delp was annoyed that one of my students wasn't sitting upright in her chair. He barked at her. It's probably because he doesn't like the student too.

I have a hard time cultivating a neutral appearance.

Turned out there was just a mixup. Cool. I want to keep 5CM. He needs help, and he's trying.

I need to ask Whitney if she would like to do the library and I the gym. I think it's important to offer multiple options here. She's a sports fanatic, so I doubt it. But, I aim to give her options too. She's so stressed. I'm not sure how to help.
