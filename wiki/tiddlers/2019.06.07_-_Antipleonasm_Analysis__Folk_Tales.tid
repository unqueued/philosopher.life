title: 2019.06.07 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Folk Tales

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
It is only in folk tales, children's stories, and the journals of intellectual opinion that power is used wisely and well to destroy evil. The real world teaches very different lessons, and it takes willful and dedicated ignorance to fail to perceive them.

Hilarious hyperbole, [[good]] sir. There are plenty of folk tales and children's stories which have unhappy endings which do not teach us to respect authority and trust those in [[power]]. Of course, the bullshit my [[donors]] shoved down our throats taught us that poor people need to learn their place and we should respect and trust those in authority for the most part, especially the American heroes. Until they had no power to censor what we consumed, we were literally only allowed to read or engage in fiction in which the "[[good]]" guys won as defined by them. My life has been a derealizing, depersonalizing stream of [[redpill]]s trying to escape the gaslitic illusions generated from my purposely poisoned origins. 

It's clear that plenty of academia thinks highly of capitalism or reactionarily serves the interests of it; they take up a more complex variant of that illusion too. But, of course, not all! I agree it takes dedicated and willful ignorance. I do not grant Hanlon's razor to almost anyone beyond young children because [[Virtue is Knowledge]], and you were free to become the kind of person who knew better over time.

I say this also recognizing I'm still in over my head, and I'm still failing to open my eyes effectively enough. I aint so saint, but I gotta figure out what a saint would have me do. C'mon, [[WWDD]]?
