!! 2019.09.27 - Close Encounter: Kevin (Another)

I found him again. He's working overtime, and it's his first week in this madhouse. Previously heavily gauged ears, faux mullet, and you can tell he's trying to appear more appetising to his masters. He's got a baby too. He loves to read, but he doesn't have the time or money for codex. He likes audiobooks. If I understand correctly, the phone he accesses is his only device. I made sure he knows my name, he wrote my number on his palm (he said he doesn't know his own number, and I believe him). I'm going to hand him a Resilio Sync key, and I asked him to send me lists of books he wants. Slaves need books. I [[hope]] to be a useful ear and source for this man.

!! 2019.07.17 - Close Encounter: Kevin

We bought a dryer from a man who has fixed and sold them in his spare time for 15 years. Thankfully, it wasn't all business. We actually got to talk a good bit about his life. He's getting out of the business because of planned obsolescence. 

He works for an RV company, says he makes them $200/h and only gets paid $11/h. Runs the joint for them. I discussed Marxism with him without saying the word. He's a poor man who works his ass off for his daughter. I listened carefully.

I paid him, gave him my offline card, and thanked him. Cool dude.

!! 2019.07.03 - Close Encounter: Ray Lyons

I was getting my +200k mile vehicle checked at Walmart, and I sat down in the waiting room adjacent to a man in a red shirt with a flag and "PATRIOT" written on it. Of note, he had a foot/leg brace. I asked him about it, and he said it was agent orange which caused it. We talked about life with it, a history of it, why he came to use this particular kind, others he had known with such a device, and his obviously expensive athletic shoes. We talked about bargain hunting online. The man was a clear storyteller, and he was far too quick to offer the "I don't know your creed, but here's what I believe" line multiple times. 

He did 95% of the talking, and my interrogatory nature snowballed. I found an opening to ask him what he did for a living. He's a Carter County Commissioner, a politician of sorts. Before that, he was a social worker for a long time, and then he headed up quasi-governmental/privatized organizations in our area which dealt with almost every major organization, including prisons. I pressed him on his time there, on his views on prisons, corruption of those in power, and those imprisoned. He offered the evidence, and I offered the correct conclusion in our signaling; he smiled several times when I called evil what it really was without being polite about it. He assumed I was a psychologist or counselor but did not appear surprised to find I was a philosopher (it is something I hear often among learned and unlearned about me).

He is a pragmatic man who understands prisoners are human beings, he aims to serve the public, and I complimented him on it. We talked about addiction, treatment, and I questioned his understanding of the topic (there was some backpeddling). He was also worried about being called a socialist, and I told him I am a socialist. With a rapid crescendo, the conversation ended. He shook my hand, I gave him my online card, and he shook my hand again. I told him that if he needs someone to speak with, I'm here. And, I am! =)

I saw him once more, and he patted me on the shoulder. If you are reading this, `/wave`. You are proud of how you implemented suggestion boxes. Will you listen to my voice too? I have much to say, sir.

!! 2019.06.29 - Close Encounter: Goodwill Awkwardness

A young man working in the store was perfectly awkward just like me. We encountered each other several times, talked about the morality of calculators, and joked even (that never fucking happens with me!). I handed him my online card. He said my son was extremely polite.
