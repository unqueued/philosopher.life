title: 2019.08.20 - TDL: Shop

* You've held at as long as you should. We have two bags of fruit left, and the veggies dwindle. Shop, homie.
* Max skinning. I think you should send it all to Exporter for Leatherworking and Blacksmithing.
** Also, AH your goods. You dropped 70% last night.
* Letters, as usual. 
* I'm don't think you are having enough dialectures with your offspring.
* Continue to piece together [[m16]]. 
** Part of me is screaming about how long it is taking, but part of me is thrilled that I'm just going at the pace that I go. That is not usually me in this context, and it's probably a good thing.
* Depends on how things go at the school, but perhaps we can increase the number of people we include to do TW (assuming they care at all).
* You need to do some laundry, homie.
