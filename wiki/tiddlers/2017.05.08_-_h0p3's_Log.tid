!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

Doing fine. I slept terribly last night, but this is as it always is with DCK. I will sleep quite well tonight. k0sh3k is also very sleepy. We stayed up late (11:15) to finish our family meeting last night (although, I couldn't sleep until about 3:00, and even then only half-brainededly). Everyone was sleepy, including the children.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

Despite being a long day yesterday, it was a wonderful day. I really enjoyed bonding with my family. My children have been asking for a while to play a game with me. I brought out the magic cards and taught them. I've given MUC to 1uxb0x and Affinity to j3d1h. I talked about my history with these cards, what they meant to me, what it would take to learn to play it, etc. It was a blast for us all. I ended up playing different decks against them to give them a quick sampling. My favorite game was with 1uxb0x since I decided to play MWC against his MUC. It was truly an epic control vs control matchup.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

DCK has been quite effective. I'm trying to make my children's lives easier and more interesting by integrating myself more directly into their lives. This is a lot easier when I am not responsible for holding them accountable. When I can just be their friend, it is miles easier for us all, more productive, and we're all happier.

I've been doing the kitchen with my kids. While they can and even perhaps should do it themselves, this model seems to work better in many ways. I want to be side-by-side with them.

Honestly, I have no idea if they want to play magic with me. I'm not always very fun to play games with. I gave them what they asked for, or so it seems. Perhaps they are asking for something else. We will clarify it.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

Enjoy my time with my family, particularly while I still have it.
