title: 2018.11.10 - JRE: Woodworkin'

My brother has taken his first breath of fresh air after reaching the surface. He got his balls grabbed, Rebecca is teasing him, maybe even sexy times if he wants. He's setup Divinity Original Sin 2 to play on hard mode. 

He joked with me about trying to get private servers up; I'm trying to avoid the timesink while still being social with those who engage in the timesink. I also want the kids and [[AG]] to connect on games that are very much integrated into the lives we have led. I think that'd be cool.

We talked about shows and our weirdness. I love being able to shoot the shit with him about it.

My brother didn't end up getting a regulator for the torch. That makes sense. Epoxy is will wait. He's working on them fundamentals, and he doesn't want the cutting boards to be too busy. He's finished the rails (and sounds like he didn't even need to put as much work as he did, but will be read for the day he needs it), and now is workin' on sleds. It sounds like he's building useful things with consistency, either on his shop or for gifts and stuff needed in the house. It's cold as fuck today, so he's probably feeling it out there. He was huffin' and puffin' too. I wonder if he enters a kind of ready-to-hand mode in woodworkin'.

I'm forgetting everything we talked about, but that's okay. I can't remember everything.
