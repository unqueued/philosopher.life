//How do I engage in more sensitive caching and invalidation [[irwartfrr]]?//

* Data Structures for finding the [[salience]]:
** Bottom-up percepts, atomic, static, virtually immutable data structures for finding the objectively valuable subjective infinitesimal into qualia which must be contextualized and modeled:
*** Naming:
**** `YYYY.MM.DD - foobar-[[Titletag]]: [[Subtitle]]`
**** Strongly preferably immutably; something went really wrong if you screw up here.
*** Mutable only in virtue of:
**** Body
***** [[Retroactive Footnotes]] metadata
***** Syntactical English editing (aiming not to revise the semantics)
***** [[The Golden Rule]]
**** [[Tag|Tagging Theory]] and Field metadata

** Top-down modeling, molecular, emergent, dynamic, mutable data structures for finding [[The Objective]] [[Infinite]]:
*** Naming:
**** Whatever fits best, as best you can. The Measure of the Mean.
**** Which one has the highest probability of finding what matters most [[irwartfrr]]?
**** When it evolves, often worthy of [[alias]]ing.
*** Body
**** It is a directory or a definition (or both).
**** How does this object fit into larger heuristics, multi-threaded dialectical models, hypothetical and instrumental reasoning, which are toward [[The End]] [[irwartfrr]]?
**** [[APFVD]]'s full-blown projects and narratives, but there are many kinds of [[directories]].
**** How do you make it so that you are built to be transparent, accurate, negotiated through reflective equilibrium, and humble [[irwartfrr]]?
*** Immutability Preference only in virtue of parseability, searchability, linkability, and it's the continuation of Top-down restructuring.
*** The sidebar should be dynamically generated, but tiddlers that show up in the storyriver should not whenever possible.

* Algorithms for finding the [[salience]] via [[DOR]].
** Orders, categories, logics, languages, and recursion
** Search
** The Virtuously Self-Improving Human Algo that plugs in the semantics and grinds on that [[TOP]] grindstone wiki horcrux-pensieve like a reasonable student.
