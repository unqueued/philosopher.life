*** I've long had the remnants of my Chicago-style economics left in my belief-system. I'm glad to see evidence helping me fade it away.

** https://www.cjr.org/innovations/google-journalistic-right-to-be-forgotten-by-claiming-its-journalistic.php
*** Let me say upfront, I don't trust Google a lick. However, unfortunately, they are correct that the "right to be forgotten" can be problematically wielded. There are journalistic, academic, historical, and social reasons that we should not enable individuals to scrub and censor. Do we trust others to wield accountability information correctly? Ugh. I don't. It's damn if you do, damned if you don't. In an age where nothing ultimately disappears, I am worried about the Orwellian problem. To this, therefore, I suggest we follow the Jewish tradition of Jubilee: 7 years of memory.

*** Interesting arguments. I will remind you that bankruptcies, as legal processes, is not a good measurement of those who are actually bankrupted.  You clearly make money in this arena (and deal in making money for others in it), so forgive my doubts. That you don't even attempt to speak of socialism or systematic changes outside of healthcare shows is a serious problem.
