You're not to be so blind with patriotism that you can't face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says it.

You probably shouldn't be blinded by any patriotism at all. There is only [[The Moral Law]]. The problem, of course, is that we have to build governments which legally enable immorality in a wide variety of cases; that's also required by [[The Moral Law]]. 

The irony of patriotism is that respect for the justified Rule of Law, justice as it might depart from our moral Hohfeldian rights, takes up this claim to as a truism. Unfortunately, I've never met a self-identified patriot I appraisally respected, but I have voted for them.
