title: Fundamental Disagreement

In those cases of fundamental disagreement, I assume we charitably think of each other as desperately wrong in brilliant ways. I take it to be the case that we both make good inferences based upon each of our [[foundational|Foundationalist Theory of Epistemic Justification]] assumptions, but that we have no further justifications or explanations we can give to convince the other of our epistemic starting positions. Inescapably, we all have private reasons or beliefs that by their very nature are prone to convince ourselves, but not others.<<ref "17">> 

<<footnotes "17" "Unfortunately, at the foundational level, complete resolution/agreement is the result of being convinced by someone who is merely pointing to some idea and saying, 'Hey, look at this, I'm convinced it's correct...' without any other further possible justification.">>
