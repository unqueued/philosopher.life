title: 2017.04.28 - Wiki Review Log

* [[Fun Word Collection]]
** Added a tiny intro. Collections should express an intent other than what is being cataloged. You should see why it matters to me, even if I only briefly explain it.

** Added content. I'm glad I'm doing this. I hope it won't be too much work. We will review.
* [[Dave Chappelle's Redpill Conversion]]
** Digested it more.
