title: 2004.12.08 - Paul and Dante

	How does one begin to compare and contrast Paul, Apostle to the Gentiles, and Dante, author of The Divine Comedy? Paul cultivated the ekklesia, organizing the church as an institution within Gentile communities, while Dante had the benefit of a millennium of experience and knowledge, lived with a medieval outlook. Dante’s perspectives on “Christianity, God, and God’s plan for humanity” may be starkly different from the Apostle Paul’s perspectives, however, we cannot neglect the basic links of faith shared between both Paul and Dante.

	Paul is one of the most powerful human personalities in the history of the Church. He was a missionary, theologian, and administrator. Paul often acted as an apologist and had a high impact on Christian theology, most notably found in his Letter to the Romans. He argued against other Christian leaders on disputed issues. He discussed the ongoing authority of the Jewish law; he defended the maintenance of high standards within the decline of the practices of kashrut, circumcision, and other Jewish law; and, he explained God’s plan for the Gentiles. Paul distinctly wrote about God’s intentions for both the Jews and Greeks, the concept of the Chosen, and the relation between the body and the spirit. Paul always maintained the necessity of unity, respect, and order. He was apocalyptic and firmly believed in the God’s providential hand in the world. Paul helped form the foundation of the early church; he was God’s instrument.

	Dante Alighieri was a political philosopher and Italian poet who wrote the epic poem The Divine Comedy. Dante depicts an after-life based on “individual freedom and responsibility,” and “divine retribution and reward” (Honderich 176). In terms of his own Christian understanding, Dante was greatly influenced by the scholastics. Very prominent philosophers of religion and influential theological arguments came before Dante: Augustine’s masterful fusion of Platonic philosophy and Christian theology, St. Anselm’s ontological argument, and St. Thomas Aquinas’ synthesis of Aristotelian reason into theology. Dante’s Inferno is the most widely read portion of his comedy. He depicted characters with ironic punishments befitting the crime committed. Dante’s readers are struck by the sheer order, unity, and symmetry present in the poem. Dante’s Inferno captures fundamental beliefs of Christian orthodox doctrine, while illustrating a vivid Hell; his poem is intertwined with a medieval understanding of the world and God.

	The paradox of the material and immaterial is a distinctive feature of both Paul and Dante. Paul spoke more decisively on “the body.” The relation between “the Body of Christ” and the physical form of Jesus is a difficult dualism to understand, even modern Pauline scholars struggle with what Paul meant. Dante was clearly influenced by scholasticism; especially in reference to the paradox of the material and immaterial. The basic medieval solution to this dualism is to understand the immaterial to be more real and closer to God while the material world is less real and further from God. In Canto 3 of the Inferno we see shades and more immaterial beings, while in Canto 34 we see ice, lead, and heavy material. Dante obviously intended for this gradual increase of materiality to be apparent as he traveled closer to the bottom of Hell.

	Paul’s primary theological problem can be found in the two dispensations, the first being God’s election of the nation of Israel and His gift of the law to Israel, and the second as His offer of salvation to any all (Jews and Gentiles) who have faith in Christ Jesus (Sanders 137). Paul attempts to smooth the rough edges between the Old and New Testaments. Paul believes that God preordained this transition from Judaism to Christianity. He accepts (in some aspects) Roman dominion; he certainly would be willing to accept that God had preordained the Roman Empire so that Christ could fulfill prophesy. Dante also supports this idea of a providential hand of God. Medieval thinkers had to explain the existence of the Roman Empire and the development of the early church in terms of providence and predestination. The Roman Empire was a precondition to the birth and death of Jesus Christ. Dante fittingly used Virgil in the Inferno, who described the initial establishment of an imperial authority in the Aeneid. Dante’s choice of an Roman epic poet indicates a respect for not only the great artist himself, but also signifies Dante’s belief that Virgil, like many founders of Roman society, necessarily existed for the sake of Christ, so that Christianity could inevitably take root and spread to all people.

	Paul, like the earlier Christians thought that the world was soon coming to an end; “the coming of the Messiah meant that the end had begun, and his resurrection was the first act of the eschatological scenario” (Meeks 175). Paul uses apocalyptic imagery to respond to concerns of church members who had passed before the return. Paul eventually declares that the community of Christians crosses even the boundary of death (Meeks 175). The primary function of apocalyptic language was to reinforce the cohesion and unity of the Christian community. In turn, this would allow for Christianity to spread rapidly while remaining more stable (with fewer interruptions). Dante did not speak much about the apocalypse. His lack of focus on this subject is mainly because the apocalypse was a difficult issue for those who realized that Paul’s outlook of the future was wrong (here is where the millennium of experience clearly changed Dante’s perspective). But, Dante’s poem The Divine Comedy, especially the Inferno, illuminated generations with vivid descriptions of divine retribution and reward. Readers of the Inferno become more mindful of what is meant by the concept of judgment, which is not much different from Paul emphasis on the importance of knowing where one was going in the afterlife.

	The Apostle Paul paved the way for early Christianity. The Medieval outlook and philosophy could not exist without Paul’s work. Moderns must understand that Paul’s theological, evangelical, and administrative had one of the largest impacts on western tradition, one of those traditions being Dante’s medieval outlook and experience. Although they lived different lives and looked at the world through different lenses, both the Apostle Paul and Dante are both connected by their faiths.
