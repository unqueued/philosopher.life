title: 2019.05.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Do Nothing

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If you can think of nothing that wouldn't do harm, then do nothing.

Yikes. I realize this is meant to be a rule of thumb, and codification is crazy hard. Further, here I face the absurdity of New Criticism. It depends on how you contextualize this claim. Harm [[W5H]]? Some people, institutions, structures, and objects in the world ought to be harmed. The preference is to be constructive for [[The Good]], but that is logically going to entail deconstruction in dialectics. 

This reminds me of that ever-so-civil advice: "If you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all." I will remind that you that nice and kind are not identical. Both are sweeping generalizations.

As far as I can tell, in finite dialectics, there is always a cost for doing anything (including thinking). Thus, it's not actually possible to think of nothing that wouldn't do harm, as both the thinking costs something and the doing of whatever is thought does harm (which is not the claim it's wrong). We also can't do nothing as long as we exist. It may be the case that nothing wouldn't do harm, but I'm in a difficult position talking about the being of non-being. However, it appears each thing harms something. This conditional borders on being self-referential; it is either absurd or false.
