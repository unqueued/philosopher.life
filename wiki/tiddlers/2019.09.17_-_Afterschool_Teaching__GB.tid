title: 2019.09.17 - Afterschool Teaching: GB

Prep went fine, but I'm sometimes crunched for time doing it solo. I'm going to see if I can just trade the paperwork over to Whitney since I'm doing the food prep entirely. I doubt she will aim to be fair, but worth trying. 

Her classes at this new school are more fun for her. I try to be a useful sounding board and interrogator of what may be poor lines of reasoning about what she is doing here. We talked about having her install an SSD on her machine too (she was frustrated by a number of things in her computer).

My nudging has failed. My arguments have been ignored. I said I didn't care what the schedule said today, I'm going to be wise with how I prepare our food (we don't have to waste half of it if we do this correctly, and that food can be put to good use). Whitney may be relaying this. Good. It will be up to Delp to figure out what he's going to do with a subverise rogue employee who is more than willing to be fired to do what is moral. I need to give him a chance to recognize that replacing me isn't easy (actually, not possible) and that the price I make him make is quite minimal (especially since he is unjustifiably deceptive all the time, justified deception should be no sweat; further, it's clear I'm willing to take the scapegoat hit here if someone needs to get voted off the island for not having followed some ridiculous policy or to make up for [and hide] his supreme lack of planning).

One-on-ones are my bread'n'butter. I continue to have discussions throughout the day though. Went to put the container Delp gave back away, my highschoolers and Whitney are just sitting in the afterschool program closet-office on their phones. I don't get her. I think I put in 3x per child-hours she does just in terms of vicinity alone (not even considering interaction time, effort, and value). Maybe this isn't what she wants. What does she want? Is this just another pay check and a sunk cost fallacy at work?

5DB2 is a most serious boy. We work well together for that reason.

8L said her weekend was //nothing// and //amazing//. I am not sure what that means, but she was glowing. She didn't seem to know what it was either (or was carefully hiding it?). I am an exceptionally poor judge of moodiness, so maybe this is more normal than I understand (as the cliches go, etc.). It's a pleasure to see her happy. She needs some light. I hope it continues for her, and I hope she can see the ups and downs (I am particularly awful at this).

I've got a lot of hungry children. If they are eating fruits and veggies (though not as much), they must be hungry. I had a few not in the program ask me, and I can't say no. 

I saw [[gh057]] for only the briefest moment before I headed to the library. He's getting all the ingredients for shining. Fuck yeah.

I had several students reading today; bless you all. I had some folks studying for tests. Some played chess. Others were drawing (I don't see much of this, and I don't know why). My troublemakers and psychopaths did alright with me today too; we talked about skateboarding (I think I'm the only teacher here who has skateboarded in any serious fashion).

So many children were required to sit with me today. It's cool that some end up not minding it at all. They stay even after release from my prison inside this prison.

My nakesake is crushing. It's cute. She is a determined girl.

One thing I like about the library is that people sit together, they make friends (can't tell you how many of my children tell me they have no friends), they cuddle, they talk, they are being humans together. They are rowdier than I'd like, but they are building something with each other. I do a pretty awful job of this as an adult. These kids even set aside their baggage more effectively than I do in many cases.

They are exceptionally loud today. Whitney noticed as well. The gym saves me. I'm lucky to have time off with my library geek squad. We just talked a lot today. Tons of questions about my wiki today. They are all fascinated that I type without looking at my screen. We talk eye-to-eye while I write (though I tend not to be so talkative, I'm more listening than anything). 

I think the tide is slowly turning. We are working toward more sanity. Or, I am deceiving myself (I would never do that).

We popped open my laptop again and brought up music to listen to as we talked about other things. We talked about computers quite a bit. I'm hoping they will be interested in working on them. Several students said they were asking for a used laptop for Christmas or contemplating spending their savings. Phone ownership rates are fairly high, but x86_64 is ridiculously low among these students. We live in different worlds. I'm glad I had the chance to tell them why I hated my phone, how much I distrusted the ecosystems so many people use, and so on.

7TB concerns me. She defines herself in terms of the approval of others in social media in a way that cannot be healthy. She is excessively volatile over it too. It is poorly reasoned, and examination with her has been fruitless.

My children are learning which questions I refuse to give the time of day. One of them is: "what time is it?" when the analog clock is right there. 20% of my students can read it without trouble.

6CM shook my hand today before he left. 5JW and 5JS are also exceptionally well-behaved boys. The poverty of these boys and their attitudes are humbling. I complimented them after a discussion on it. I'm livid for them.

6KB is hilarious. I don't understand why she acts all embarrassed with me all the time. Multiple interactions like that today, including one-on-one's and a discussion we had at the cafeteria as a group. She's often asking me for help on math questions that I know she knows how to figure out, and she knows I know she knows how to figure them out. Sometimes I send her away to actually try, and sometimes I hand her minimla intuition pumps to juice her intuitions. She's a shy person who doesn't have enough confidence in her math skills. How can I help her appreciate and trust her skill here? She talks with me about her half and step siblings; I feel bad about the inequality I see there.

5DB told me he doesn't have to come here; he wants to come here (when he does). What is wrong with you, child? =) lol. He talked about Minecraft with me. Several students asked me about my thoughts on consoles. I am, of course, an elitist devil. He also helped me clean up in the library (very few students do).

Sir [[GB]] popped out of nowhere to speak with me. I cried in the library upon hearing his story. Took a while before I got home.

Delp barely looked up to interact with me at all today. Fascinating. I cannot say that bodes well.
