Welcome! Come and walk with me behind a pseudonymized [[Veil of Ignorance|VOI]]. Let us find justice together as [[Public Self-Modelers]]. Openly demonstrate to yourself and others your ability to mitigate or prevent how the [[Ring of Gyges|ROG]] alters your identity. Show me your integrity, nomad. Let's see what we're really made of together. I come to fulfill [[The Moral Law]]. Do you? Let us construct civilization bound by the only unconditional normativity that matters by universal definition. Let's constitute ourselves with [[Good]]will.

Here I aim to transparently learn to trust you in [[T42T]] fashion.<<ref "t">> With the profound risk and handicap of breathtaking honesty,<<ref "ps">> I trustingly hand over the raw information advantages of who I am (represented in this wiki) to you in the radical hopes we will morally play an accelerated, iterative, non-zero-sum, non-perfectly-competitive, profoundly [[Golden Rule]] cooperative game of respecting the dignity of Kantian [[Humanity]] with each other in the pursuit of increasingly effective approximations of the class of morally justified Nash reflective equilibriums.

I [[hope]] you learn to trust [[me|h0p3]] because you've had the overwhelming chance to sincerely know me inside and out. This wiki is deeply concerned with morally-justified public confidence and accountability, meaningful dialectics, defeating spirals of silence, and fiercely facing the chilling effects of exploitative panopticons.<<ref "pc">> We must collectively and decentrally own and pwn our identities together as wisely as we can.<<ref "dec">> I aim to literally participate in a practical digital implementation of [[The Original Position]] algorithm while playing with my cards face-up on the table. My divergent vulnerability is no accident, and your honesty earns my trust too. 

I believe I legitimately endanger myself in writing, disclosing, and distributing this wiki, but I take few steps to hide my identity from [[others]] because I consider being a pseudonymized open ~~book~~ wiki in public (especially with myself) to be my personal moral obligation (particularized to my context).<<ref "p">> Essentially, as I hope for all of us, I am searching for who you and I really are, stranger; I will do so kindly and openly in front of you and the rest of [[Humanity]] on this wiki. Thus, you will incur sousveillance costs to interact with me in [[T42T]] fashion. With integrity, I expect you to virtually be yourself with me. Bombadil the //Ring of ~~Power~~ Gyges//. Unconditionally act from unconditional duty as best you can.

I am going to publicly think about you, who you are, how you think, what you say, and what you do both online and offline. Do you wish to be so open and honest? Do you really want to interact and be in contact with me? In this context, informed consent is your responsibility (and it always was). Do not let my honesty become your enemy. You do not have to wrestle with me, but I hope you see I'm actually trying to radically cooperate with you.<<ref "n">> How will you treat this naked madman in the desert?

If you deem it necessary, please self-censor, anonymize, and cloak yourself. I will curiously think about your methods and appearances as best I can. I consider anything on the clearnet behind no paywall to be information you've left for me to find and openly think about; I will try to reason about who you are and model you as charitably as I can. I consider the webbed-trails of links surrounding your clearnet<<ref "c">> identity to be a better-than-nothing open historical representation of your current identity and total [[4DID]].<<ref "f">> Think carefully about what you say or how you interact with me or in front of me. Do not leak your metadata to me unless you really mean to.<<ref "st">> Insofar as you require it, it's your responsibility to dissociate your identity in this practice because ultimately I cannot do that for you.<<ref "priv">> 

Do not expect me to answer in a timely manner. Consider no communication immune to posting, deletion, or revision on this wiki without a justification I buy. Further, keep your own records; own your data and hence your identity to whatever [[dok]] you ought. For example, you will often find me writing my communications to you over the course of several days (or perhaps decades) on this wiki, and you can reason about how my writing came to be via capturing and analyzing daily (or even real-time) snapshots of this wiki (I know I do); see {[[Connect]]} and {[[Verify]]}. 

If you have a requirement, then be very specific with me! I will attempt to respect your wishes to remain anonymous and to maintain privacy when it is morally necessary. Provide your justificatory argument and explanatory plan for twisting my words or my hiding the information you either intentionally or might otherwise unintentionally give me //before// you reveal it. You will need a profound argument to demonstrate when and why I do not have a moral right to free speech. You must give me public reasons to change my public policies. Thus, compartmentalize and gamble your secrets and identities wisely with me. Let us transparently seek [[Righteousness|The Right]] in the desert together, nomad; let us build [[The Golden Rule]] practicing civilization together in trusting cooperation, integrity, and [[hope]]. Let us defeat Orwell & Huxley's demons together. We must [[Find The Others]].

As always, [[IA2DYJ]], and I ask you to kindly hold me accountable to it, nomad. Did I violate my {[[Principles]]}? Please tell me. I will do my best to re-engineer myself in both theory and practice when you justifiably sublate my [[fff]] identity or argument. As you can see in this wiki, I am forever grateful to those who teach me a lesson from duty. Do you think you will be epistemically or morally justified in teaching me a lesson? I will listen and empathize with you very carefully, and I'll prove it to you over this wiki. [[h0p3]] don't play, yo.

We never certainly escape or transcend the fact that our relationships are adversarial except on faith.
