title: 2019.04.18 - Prompted Introspection: Name That Smell

!! What is a smell that you remember from growing up?

The smell of the creek and stinkbait. I remember the rich earth and shit rotting in water. I loved playing in the creek, catching crawdads, and had all the usual autistic fascinations with water.

My olfactory senses have always been fairly weak, especially when I'm depressed. I assume it affects my memory and computation in profound ways. I am surprisingly sense-deficient. My [[phenomenology]] is reduced in many respects, but I think I spend a lot more time thinking in other realms and ideas. I live in thought.
