title: 2017.09.19 - Pipefitting Log

I feel much better this morning. I drive with plenty of time. I can see the clipboard plan doesn't share between two vans very well.

Dave explained what we already knew in the morning meeting: offloading pipe, the scaffold, not getting the torque setting, problems with the flanges, and not being able to dig basically halted out work. It wasn't our fault. I appreciate his acknowledgment. 

Chris-M was assigned to fabricate a drain or something out of stainless. Yay!! We get to do actual fitting!

!! Break!

We got all the pipe and fittings over, as well as all the tools and stands.

I used a real grasshopper for the first time.

We waited for permits and fire watch. I beveled. Chris-M gave me an example of what he wanted. He is very good at it.

By lunch, my bevels looked just as good. By the end of the second break, mine looked better. I didn't get to bevel on the level pipe like he did, nor did I have rotations available. 

We did the first fitup. Chris-M said he was going to let me be in charge of our foreman. He stepped in when necessary. This was my first time doing stainless fitup. 

Chris-M has another set of dogs and tools for stainless only. He says he works with it all the time.

We didn't tack because I would have to fire watch right before and during lunch. John said fuck that to our superintendent. He stood up for me.

!! Lunch!

I beveled. They sugared the weld, so we had to take it off. They fitup another one that I had prepared and taped it up right this time.

I repaired it. Chris-M liked it. John loved my work. Said I did a great job.

I noticed from the drawings that Chris-M cut a length too short. I gently guided him to that fact. 

We have to make a saddle, not in the plans for the superintendent who has been bird-dogging us all day. Yay! 12 on 12.

Chris-M cut the layout I made for alignment dogs out of spare stainless angle. That was nice of him.

!! Break!

My bevel on the lap of the lap-joint was fucking amazing. Chris-M said it was very good, John said it looked like a machine had done it, and Chris said it was insane. I may never bevel that well again, it was that good.

John finished the weld. QC made him fix a couple spots. 

I started cutting and polishing the stainless dogs.

We did the fitup for the second elbow on the "u." It was a bitch.

It was a good day.
