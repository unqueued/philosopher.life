The dialectic is fundamentally violent. It is a method of validating and invalidating one's perceptions of reality, one's beliefs and desires, one's identity. The pursuit of truth is extremely violent. Even when we wrestle gently, ultimately, it must turn violent at the end.

Corporate Agency is a tool designed to diffuse and thus defuse the demands of moral responsibility when it is convenient for those who comprisally "own" the corporation. We get mass, byzantine finger-pointing, a story so complex no one can practically follow, and then investigators feel compelled to confabulate an explanation which denies moral responsibility of these corporate agencies in the first place. The inertia in having our basic structures of society, the fear of the unknown, and the profound epistemic and moral laziness of everyone means this will only continue.
