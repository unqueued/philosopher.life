title: 2019.05.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis: One Happy Family

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The idea is to create a picture among the population that we're all one happy family. We're America, we have a national interest, we're working together. There are us nice workers, the firms in which we work and the government who works for us. We pick them — they're our servants. And that's all there is in the world — no other conflicts, no other categories of people, no further structure to the system beyond that. Certainly nothing like class. Unless you happen to be in the ruling class, in which case you're very well aware of it.

As usual, [[Saint Chomsky]]: Preach, yo!

It reminds me of telling your prostitute that you love her. Between apathy, accusations of envy and resentment, gaslighting, dismissal as conspiracy theorist, and the radically irrational reaction to even the word "socialism" among large swathes of society, it's difficult to convince people the above claim identifies a real emergency for which we must pursue revolution. It is largely an issue of the Tragedy of the Commons, particularly since sacrifice will fail in most reasonable predictions. Why play [[T42T]] when you are almost guaranteed to get your ass kicked? Being moral, of course, is the only motivation that matters for why one ought to be moral, by definition (but nobody wants to hear or live up to that either). If no one else is going to do the right thing, then why should you, right? Lol. Kant is rolling over in his grave, and Marx never had the foundation to know he should too.

I do not see a happy family at all, and most people don't. Few actually give a shit enough to do something about it though.
