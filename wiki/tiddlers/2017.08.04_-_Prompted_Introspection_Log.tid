!! Why do you dislike recent movies?

Maybe I'm getting old, crotchety, and set in my ways. (Get off my lawn!)

Perhaps I'm tempted to think the grass is always greener, to romanticize the past, etc. I don't think so though. I'm well aware of the amount of trash I've consumed.

I think I'm harder to surprise. I've been around the block a few times, and now it's difficult to entertain me, to inform me, to create media with memes that influence and strike me in the right ways.

I am not the target audience of blockbuster movies. I don't fit the right mold. 

Plots are now algorithmically edited, revised, shaped, ordered, etc. to maximize profit. Whatever hits the least common denominator is likely what is chosen, or something along those lines.

Maybe I'm a snob. It's really, really hard to make a great movie. Books always seem to have the edge.
