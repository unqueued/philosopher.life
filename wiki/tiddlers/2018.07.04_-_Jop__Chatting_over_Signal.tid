title: 2018.07.04 - Jop: Chatting over Signal

Jop and I had a great discussion. I was able to try translation services with her to have a discussion we might not have had otherwise.

We ended up switching back to English. Perhaps that is the better option, I do not know. We're going to find out. I've asked her to look at the wiki. I'm also asking my wife to see if she can schedule time off for us to visit them. This month would work.
