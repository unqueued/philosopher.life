title: Bobbit Worm Tank

I want creatures which are truly alien to me.

Partially setting aside upkeep concerns, I want jellyfish and a bobbit-worm (separate tanks?). I also want algae eaters and anything which makes upkeep simpler (which is a real pain in the ass, from my reading). There are lots of cool jellyfish, and I know I want psychedelic lighting and at least one immortal jellyfish.

I'd want absolutely transparent polymer balls (of various sizes) to form the groundwork for the bobbit-worm inside a (reasonably) sound and vibration insulated 1-way mirror tank (to prevent the bobbit-worm from realizing I was observing), and very minimal lighting which would show-off the bobbit-worm suspended in transparent "groundwork." Perhaps I would need to keep fish in the tank as well to feed it consistently. I would also like a deep learned camera feed to capture the movements and especially the hunting behaviors of the bobbit-worm.
