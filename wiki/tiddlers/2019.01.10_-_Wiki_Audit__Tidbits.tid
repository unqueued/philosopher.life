title: 2019.01.10 - Wiki Audit: Tidbits

[[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]], [[Find The Others]], [[Be A Good Dad]], [[Keeping My Enemies Closer]], and [[Wiki Review]] got some tidbits flipped here and there. I anticipate that by my next yearly retireshot, I will fill in the cracks and adjust the details enough to warrant another one. I'm going to have to start doing semantic diffs by hand to gauge whether or not they have really changed enough to do so.

Put some work into ~~KeeBoord~~ TW5-Navigator. There are multiple things going wrong. I'm asking the expert (the almighty creator himself) to help me with this. I'm so bummed. This tool could radically change how I use this wiki (both in reading and writing). Alongside several text expansions/substitutions and autocompletions, I could start moving further and further away from my mouse. That's the goal! I'm feeling like that might not happen, but we'll see.
