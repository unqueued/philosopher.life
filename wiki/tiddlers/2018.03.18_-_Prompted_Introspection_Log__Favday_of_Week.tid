title: 2018.03.18 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favday of Week

!! What is your favorite day of the week?

On average, it tends to be either Saturday or Sunday. They are easier days, days of piecing our lives together, days of building relationships and character together. Those days are key to the stories of our lives. I am very grateful to have them.

The weekdays are generally a grind (what's new?). I don't mind grinding in many respects, but it also doesn't fulfill me or us in crucial ways (we'd be unfulfilled without them, of course). 

I realize, this is a construct. There are people who don't get to plan in this way, and people who don't have the luxury of it. It's frankly disturbing. It reminds me of productivity vs wage gaps that have only continued to grow. Capitalism has ruined shabbat, and we are responsible for enabling and participating in capitalism. As usual, every day of the week is better with socialism.
