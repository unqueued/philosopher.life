title: 2019.02.04 - Wiki Review: Commentary

* [[2019.02.03 - Family Log: title.Title here]]
** I'm leaving it, my love.
* [[2019.02.02 - JRE: Fuck Football]]
** He has a ton on his plate.
* [[2019.02.03 - JRE: Bootstrapping]]
** Feel like I'm having a hard time staying connected recently.
* [[2019.02.02 - Killcoin: Gotchu Fam]]
** Always been a solid memer, regardless of our differences.
* [[2019.02.03 - Killcoin: Dialectics]]
** Time to destroy internalist virtue theory in front of him. He is externalist only when it suits him. His argument's inconsistency is loud and clear.
* [[Killcoin]]
** `/bow`
* [[2019.02.03 - Tasha: Cute]]
** Edited.
** We have to pass through layers in person to even begin talking about anything real. We don't have real conversations over text.
* [[2019.01.29 - T-Money: Chopsticks]]
** Small things are nice. I hope we go for the big ones in the desert.
* [[2019.01.30 - T-Money: Dalai Yama]]
** It whips the llama's ass.
* [[2019.02.01 - T-Money: Trial of God]]
** I know the pain. Wrong though he may be, Nietzsche was a visionary.
* [[2019.02.03 - T-Money: Thank You]]
** Let's see if he wakes up or just disintegrates again.
* [[2019.01.28 - K: Colleagues]]
** An odd term.
* [[2019.01.29 - K: LMGTFMyself]]
** I feel so old. =)
* [[2019.01.30 - K: 13-Year Wait]]
** That's why he rationalized that hard. The argument was terrible.
* [[2019.01.31 - K: Coherent Epic]]
** I think I might take his dream to be a writer more seriously than anyone else in his life.
* [[2019.02.01 - K: Crossover Stories]]
** It's hard to prep people for the feeling of meaningless with safety nets and footholds. Not being an NPC is painful. I weave hard and fast.
* [[2019.02.03 - K: S-senpai!]]
** A non-trivial point in our relationship.
* [[2019.02.01 - Jop: Car-living]]
** Feels like noise =(.
* [[2019.02.03 - Jop: BDay]]
** ;)
* [[2019.02.02 - MB: Virus Unto Humanity]]
** If she doesn't have the immediate facial expressions to empathize with, she doesn't quite connect. This is odd given some of her reading and empathy strengths.
* [[2019.01.29 - AA: Signup]]
** It appears reference and play are non-trivial doorways.
* [[2019.01.30 - AA: Snowday]]
** I think it's minimal reciprocation. That's the level I'll get, and I will continue to match it.
* [[2019.01.31 - AA: Ack]]
** This was more real though.
* [[2019.02.03 - AA: Laundry Hydra]]
** This feels like FB to me. =(
* [[2019.02.03 - CATI: 1's, 2's, and 3's.]]
** I hold such unpopular opinions among the learned.
* [[2019.02.01 - AA: Virtual Teaching]]
** Why?
* [[2019.02.02 - AA: Blessed]]
** We stick to small talk.
* [[2019.02.03 - AIR: Yup =/]]
** =(
* [[2019.01.26 - L: Almost Nooning]]
** One concern I have about those who think mental health is the goal is that: sometimes you ought not be mentally healthy. Anxiety isn't just evolutionarily valuable, but sometimes it is the sign there is something morally wrong about your life. It is possible to achieve mental health and remove the anxiety in delusional ways. I'm worried she has no intention of facing the music but instead just effectively ignoring it.
*** That makes me a real pain in the ass to deal with. I force you to look in the mirror.
*** Do not conflate hedonia with eudaimonia. Desire satisfaction is an aesthetic treadmill. Yes, Saint Kierkegaard. You so loud.
* [[2019.01.28 - L: Forward-Facing Fulfilling]]
** For starters, let's try not working at Humana.
* [[2019.02.01 - L: Curious]]
** I'm going to bet she's avoiding thinking about it. I think she's being deceptive to both of us here. I have seen her do it before.
* [[2019.02.03 - Sphygmus: Linky]]
** Building family.
* [[2019.02.02 - Sphygmus: Puns]]
** I l o v e w h e n s h e d o e s t h i s. I cannot say I understand it. There is an odd flatness to it. When she emotes, it's loud! Not even considering the content (which is what is most meaningful to me), from a strictly rhetorical standpoint: [[YWSOAM]].
* [[2019.02.01 - Tasha: Matt]]
** Yeah, they partied. That was no business trip.
* [[2019.02.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Damned Dark-Triadic Devils]]
** Seems to be coming true with [[Killcoin]].
* [[2019.02.03 - Prompted Introspection: Car Wreck]]
** There's nothing I can do about it now, but I am a witness of my lack of witnessing.
* [[2019.02.03 - Wiki Review: Cool. Productive Enough.]]
** Yeah, that would be nice. I have a billion things to do. It's on the infinite docket.
* [[2019.02.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shabbat]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.02.03 - TDL: Work]]
** Maybe ribs. I'm still not sure. I feel like there is a lot of other food in the fridge to eat.
* [[2019.02.03 - Music Exploration: Leftovers]]
** Some good music, but nothing which goes into the library.
* [[EFF: Why You Really, Really Should Hire Me]]
** Maybe this won't be the title. I have so much to do.
