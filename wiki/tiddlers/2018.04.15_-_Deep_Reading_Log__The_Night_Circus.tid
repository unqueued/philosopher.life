I must not be understanding the book or something. I'm restarting the book.

The moment in the rain when she realizes her opponent does feel cool.

<<<
I am not afraid of you.

Okay, okay. I adore a good love story. It's very hard to impress me. I love the feeling of that mushy love.

I like how they magically orgasm somehow when they first touch hands.

The foreshadowing of "love" being more powerful for eternity than the search for power itself is mindnumbing/boring.

This book is significantly better when you purposely read it as pornography.
