title: 2018.09.04 - Prompted Introspection: 24 Hours

!! You are given 24 hours to do whatever you would like, money no object. What do you do and why?

Lady Melisandre, you are the gift that keeps on giving, my jar of oil. I suppose that makes me master of the planet for a day, perhaps more. My goal would be to institute [[The Original Position]] and [[Socialism]] (which may just be redundant). You are a source of idealism, no doubt.
