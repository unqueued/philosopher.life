title: 2017.06.13 - Pipefitting Log

Today was interesting. I went to the office to get them to use my account to buy the 4th book since I thought I'd be ready soon for it. I also found out that I'm officially in loan default and this is why I can't receive Tennessee lottery scholarship funds. 

Charlie, the old liaison, singled me out today in the building. We talked for a second. I explained I was looking for work. I told him about my resume, and he said he wanted a copy and would look on my behalf with some other staff. I gave it to him.

I also went to my teacher with my resume. He will be sending it to TEC. I will also visit them because, why not?

I went straight to studying, even without study points. The guys went to work on the simulator. I went and helped them when they needed it, but largely studied. We finished the 3" project by the skin of our teeth. It was a terrible fit. I believe my teacher is wrong about the 1/8th buttweld takeouts. He says not to do them, but the book says to do them. We keep being too long, and the takeouts would have made it fit. Chris and I have both agreed to start doing these takeouts, we just won't tell our teacher. 

The teacher helped us get it mounted by pointing out a new tool and giving us his unique alignment tool. It was tricky. I had to sweat a lot to get it in there.

Afterward, I went back to studying. The teacher came to talk to me because he wanted me to do more shop work. I argued (respectfully) with him about why I thought this was the better way. Even though I'm probably right, I think it would be unwise to cross my capricious teacher. He does not think rationally, and whether or not he would give me a good recommendation has more to do with his feelings about me than anything else. So, I decided to do it his way. I believe placating him instead for the reference is still more valuable than the testing. It's a sacrifice though.

The teacher assigned 2" buttweld for the simulator. Chris and I quickly zoomed through the isometric, collecting measurements, drawing up a fabrication, doing the math, and cutting the pipe. We may quickly put the first half together.

Afterward, I visited Randy. I walked in on him trying to build something for the shop. He needed my help. I'm glad I kept an extra pair of gloves in my backpack (since I normally keep it all at the shop). I grabbed my stuff and did the fitting for him while he welded. We talked. I told him about my predicament. He will be talking to his boss on Thursday to try and find a pre-apprenticeship position. He did not sound confident that he could find me anything because even 4 apprentices don't have work at the moment. Admittedly, the Boilermakers union looks better right now. If I'm traveling, then I'm traveling. 

Interestingly, Randy said that he would allow me to be in the union while working elsewhere at a major company. It counts for my hours toward the union. I think this is a novel idea. I need to hear what my brother thinks about it.

Afterward, I went to Jacobs' address. It leads to nowhere in an industrial park area. I also hit up the corporate Eastman building. They directed me to go online. That is what I was trying to avoid. I want to talk to someone in person. Fine. I'll do it online.
