* After 8 phone calls, we made the switch to gigabit!
** 500mbit up and down at best, actually. I'm surprised the symmetry works. I want to abuse it now! =)
** I am behind yet another router. Kill me, please.
*** You could tell they don't know what the fuck they are doing. New department, ping worked, Google did, https fucked everywhere else. Fishy.
** Still not canceled. We were fucking lied to, and I have the e-mails to prove it. Nobody wants to take responsibility, of course. I know this game. KYS.

* Car registration.
** I lost a piece a paper like a dipshit.

** Fitter job would do us some good. Either way, we will be okay, I think. ^^right?^^
* Got muh ears lowered.
* Shower. I don't smell like myself, and my beard is as Marxlike as it gets.
* My wife already started dinner without me! 
** I was still able to be useful though. Good. It was an amazing meal. Terrible for us and delightful.
** Fruits (including pineapple), veggies (thank you Mary, garden fresh are bitchin'), cheesy-grits (omelet for wife), fried onion, bacon, hashbrown (dat bacon grease, yo), tomato, and peanuts.
*** Am I pregananant? What I want for dinner makes no sense. 
**** My poor offspring have no idea what counts as remotely normal, I'm afraid.
* BCS
** We have finally gone past where I've been. =)
* Wandered and tested on WoW. 
* Read+Write
* Cleaning
* Read+Write
* Drunk off my ass
* Fireman Time!
* LOTR
* Sleep by 3:30
