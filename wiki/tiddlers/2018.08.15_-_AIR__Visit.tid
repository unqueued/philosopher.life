My brother found a greyhound roundtrip. He's going to be buying a computer and probably a phone. I'm very excited to get him all setup.

I'm ridiculously excited to see him. I never see my brothers enough.

We got setup on Signal as well. I'm hope we will be able to stay even more connected than we have. I know he is super busy.
