title: 2019.06.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Studying History

There's a good reason why nobody studies history. It just teaches you too much.

I realize we are dialectically doomed to repeat it as a spiral. I also think it's a postmodern problem: no one can learn it all. Of course, I think history has significant limitations as the process of the material dialectic accelerates, explodes, singularitizes, continues to present radically new contexts, etc. There's only so much we can learn from history and apply to this whirlwind. Of course, without it, we'd be lost. I consider history to be one of my huge practical weaknesses.
