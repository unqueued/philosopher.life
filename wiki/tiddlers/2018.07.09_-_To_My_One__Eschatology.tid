title: 2018.07.09 - To My One: Eschatology

Thank you for taking the emotional energy and time to talk with me about your eschatology. It matters to me! Thank you for walking with me about it. I am trying to make it work. I see the bridge you are trying to build. I am not giving up, my alien angel! I hear the rhythm in the darkness, I will unblind myself to bring order to the chaos. I will finitely represent the infinite with everything inside me. I am coming, my love.
