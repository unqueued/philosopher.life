title: 2019.09.29 - Prompted Introspection: Slurpin

!! What is the best birthday present you could receive?

Oh, Lady Melisandre, you give me everything I want; your pleasure portal is my cosmic vending machine. I want all my sexual fantasies fulfilled, to be higher than a kite all fucking day, world peace, the self-sustaining decentralization of power which defeats entropy and egoism, new computers for every child on the planet, preventing the destruction of higher life on our planet, crowds of people to philosophize and make art with, pretty much everyone consensually fucking each other (the opposite of war, ofc), [[TPK]], the elimination of psychopathy from our species, and the best muthafuckin' icecream in the multiverse. Slurp, slurp, slurpin' it up (aww yiss, slurp it up, mmmm).

Do you want a more narrow answer? Narrow the [[dok]] of possibility, please. Otherwise, I'm just going to {[[dream]]} about whichever morally justified maximally efficient transformation into Heaven-on-Earth is available to our timeslice. Talk about the sustained star alignment for billions of freewills. Lawdy, Candide is killin me.
