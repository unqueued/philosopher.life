title: 2019.02.13 - Wiki Review: Expanding

* [[2019.02.12 - Link Log: Keep Puking]]
** I'm still overflowing. 
** As usual, there's not nearly as much commentary as I'd like. At this point, I'm just dumping, and that's okay. This is triage (and it may always be). 
* [[2019.02.12 - TWGGF: Commander]]
** I'm so excited. I hope it's modularized well enough to continue to grow. I think the [[Search of h0p3]] is aiming to be modularized in this way too. Ultimately, I think batch actions should occur under the umbrella of effective search and selection.
* [[2019.02.12 - Afterschool Teaching: Helper]]
** I have no idea if he will be useful to us, and I have no idea if I will be useful to him. I will do what I can.
* [[2019.02.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Hampton on The Hamptons]]
** It's war. It ain't pleasant.
* [[Propaganda & Overton Window Dialectical Quotes]]
** I'm looking forward to filling it up.
** Maybe it should be entitled //Memetic Warfare Quotes//.
* [[2019.02.12 - Prompted Introspection: Lulu]]
** It probably ain't going to happen. =(
* [[2019.02.12 - Seeking Sphygmus: Sky is a Limit]]
** Perhaps I should give Skyrim a run. My kids need to know the stories of our people.
* [[Flatland]]
** This book is perhaps not worth finishing.
* [[2019.02.12 - Wiki Review: Ooze]]
** I'm feeling happier about the [[review]] process too. Perhaps this is a sign of a lift in my depression. That seems to be a signal.
* [[2019.02.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Grind]]
** Completed
* [[2019.02.12 - TDL: I Might Do It!]]
** And, it's okay if you don't. [[Sphygmus]] is correct in her tickler-orientation. Some dreams will happen, some won't. I'm going to go with the flow for now before I attempt to instutite further accountability on myself (because I obviously failed to find the right thresholds).
