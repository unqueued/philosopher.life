title: Pragmatism

Being practical means asking ourselves awful questions like: "Is there really room for one more?"

I see a lot of people who despise "theory" as a way to slip something into the dialectic. It is a weasel method. It is a trojan horse. I think a lot of people eschew theory in favor of practice because they think the theory doesn't match reality.

I think the same for a lot of instances of "pragmatism." I think it is a failure to recognize the theory behind their practice isn't coherent. That it doesn't work on logical grounds. 

Theory and Practice are two sides of the same coin. They are yin and yang. They are eternally fighting to help us reach the truth at the core of the coin. They are point and counterpoint. We must repeatedly implement them as A/B testing. They are the revolving doors we rotate through as a method of inquiry.
