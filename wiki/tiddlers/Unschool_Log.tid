title: Unschool Log

//As my parents always barked to me: "If you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all."//

I'm at my wit's end. It's time to go for broke, to throw the Hail Mary, to use my last remaining spellcast: Absolute Unschooling. No structure. No requirements. It sounds crazy, and it just might be. We've tried modified unschooling to various degrees, but nothing like this. I hope it works. 

My goal is for my children to find things they care about, including themselves and their futures. I hope they work on projects that matter to them. I hope they learn how to grind, put forth their best effort, and to consistently work on what matters most to them. I'm throwing them in the deep end. This is closer to what being an adult is like, without all the pressures or immediate consequences (sounds not so good from that vantage point). In any case, let's hope they learn to swim.

It is my dearest hope that I can empower my children, that I can facilitate them as they see fit. I still hope they will take my advice, seek my counsel, plan, and execute. I hope they take the bull by the horns, that they do something with this power. Let's face it, they've already had it, and they didn't live up to our expectations. Let's set our expectations aside, at least at face value, and see where they go. Maybe it will work. It's a shot in the dark, but there's a chance it will work.

This will be a place where I say only positive things about my children's schooling. I don't want to be negative. I'm not convinced that style of feedback is really ultimately working. 

Good luck, young ones! With great freedom comes great responsibility.<<ref "1">>
