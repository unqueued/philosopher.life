title: 2019.04.29 - TDL: ATM

* Dryer checks
** Measure. You might not be able to move it.
** Need to hit an ATM. We have no cash.
* Work
** Delp has his usual artificial rush, "oh noes," deceives everyone, etc.
* We have those thai dishes to prepare. Sounds good to me.
** Don't forget the nuts.
* Kids are waking up later and later. 
** Sleep is necessary; I think you just keep watching and thinking about it for now.
