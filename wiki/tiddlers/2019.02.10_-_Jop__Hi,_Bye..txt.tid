It's been a good week. Wiki is the best explanation. Lots of work done in the wiki. Applying to a job (been a while since I worked this hard on an application). [[k0sh3k]] had the flu, but she's now feeling better. Kids did well in school.

Good to hear that she is better. I hope you find a job soon. Hug and kiss the kids for me.
