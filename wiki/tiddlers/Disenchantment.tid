!! Disenchantment: S01E01

Intro feels Samurai Jack. It's Groening. Voice, visual, maybe even the writing.

Daphne of Frasier, sexual norms, lots of riffing on other fantasy cartoons.

Misery, disenchantment, the demon.

Well, there's a lot of focus on sex. I can dig that.

Some anti-capitalism and Mulan feel to it.

Groening's take on Indiana Jones irony. I'm fine with that.

I actually don't understand what a drinking buddy really is. Friends or bust is really my goal. I'm such an extremist, lol.

Might be another Netflix moneypit

JRE says this evolves into something more like Game of Thrones in terms of worldbuilding than Futurama. This show does borrow often (which is no problem for me, obviously).

Nobody gives a shit about anyone else except as mere means.

Tons of wonderful innuendo, slapstick, irony, and even some 4th wallbreakiness. I still see Futurama. There is more planning though, and it feels less forced and formulaic (though, perhaps because this is new).

The "science" is fun. Bestiality is awesome.

Unfortunately, I'm still figuring out who I am?

!! Disenchantment: S01E03

Seems like a fine social commentary.

Substance use, aesthetic pursuit of the princess, etc.

So many things are out of place, but that's the charm.

"I'm drowning...I'm Elfo" Lol.

Lots of incoherence that behaves like a meme.

Neolib gender neutrality, check.

Love the manifestations of conscience.

He doesn't know his own daughter's body and half-face, lol.

The lack of political autonomy (though not moral) is constantly in our face.

Bender is obviously here.

I love how competence is not rewarded.

I have no idea why they go to save the demon.

Fate reminds me of the twins in Superjail.

<br>

!! Disenchantment: S01E04

Hustle and bustle music.

"Making murder plans with my cat [demon]" - Sounds like my wife.

The most dramatic and elegant parts of the world are how they kill each other.

Solid stages of dance anxiety. Fueled up on cheese; Charlie from IASIP!

Elfo has become Redpilledtm in his elixir of life claim and dealing with social desires.

I think I need to drink while I watch this show. Jesus.

It's crucial to see that the wealthy really do live longer. They harvest the capital of the poor.

Wink, wink, wink.

Cleaning up after a party isn't an experience I've had. Not really a party animal though.

I don't care for how royalty are still the stars of the show.

<br>

!! Disenchantment: S01E05

The religious order is what it do. Unfortunately, I don't think the princess has any right to wield logic either.

Bucktooth is a hallmark of Groening.

In fact, I'm annoyed by even the remotest implied piety of the princess, but that might the point. I suggest the possibility that some ambiguity is meant to be displayed here, and I don't think it's ambiguous. Groening's characters have this problem.

"The smell is out of this world." - fits the show.

It does the classic children stories with a funny twist.

<br>

!! Disenchantment: S01E06

We meet this son.

I'm going to complain whether it references or not, lol.

Lampreys sound awful. They did a good job on that one. Again, Indiana Jones keeps showing up.

Ambassadorship demonstrates me to that we can very rarely be ourselves, especially when we all think we can't be ourselves.

I think this is Princess Bride more than Game of Thrones.

<br>

!! Disenchantment: S01E07

I love the whore fairie.

Sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll aren't just normalized, they are the subject. It's all a joke.

Prisonweb of lies.

GianTESS is ripped grad student. Groening is growing up.

I hope I'm ugly-sexy. Lol.

I need that eye. I wonder what she sees when she looks inside herself. Beauty on the inside is not something I have (yet!, right?)

I've decided I need some snoosnoo and hallucinogens (opiates aren't really that, unless you want to push the meaning of perceptual distortion like that).

<br>

!! Disenchantment: S01E08

Truth serum, all-seeing eyes. Substance use, magical chemistry, etc.

I like the fate-oracle folks. Wish I understood more about it. We see very little.

Demon's description of entertainment is wonderful. Sometimes he gets to tell the truth when no one else does.

Lol, I heard "eros" instead of "arroz"

It is "safer" to enter, lol.

Forged in adventure and sealed in the bedroom...jdei in the streets, sith in the sheets.

Fascinating mistakes in gender and sex here. I think they are making fun of the idiotic parts of identity politics while attempting to preserve what is quite right about it. I'm not saying this is a technical discussion, but it is pointing.

I love that the characters talk about what's wrong with the story as if they are the audience watching. The eggline is great.

The demon is only contained in a bottle.

"eh, I've beheld better" lol, I've never beheld "beheld' be...used that way before.

As usual, very strong visual point of view with Groening. The pendant is better than I would have imagined.

Deus ex Griffoned again. Lol.

Finally, the end of dreamland. Evil motives it is. Interesting that Fate has someone commenting on it.

<br>

!! Disenchantment: S01E09

One of my favorite aspects of Groening's work is how the characters say our private thoughts out loud. He holds nothing back.

The obsession with eternal life is another substance. We want that experience machine.

Touchey/Scruffy reminds me of oldschool cartoons.

Elfo is punching Lucy the Demoncat back for the previous episode.

I wonder what the smell of conformity is IRL.

Maybe it has a Gulliver's Travels feel to it as well. Hobbit adventure is there too.

The Battle Elves mode is great.

Would be amazing if they let Elfo die. Aint gonna happen though.

Confused about half-elf's blood now.

<br>

!! Disenchantment: S01E10

Two queens. Sounds fun.

It is painful seeing the truth all the time. I try not to avoid it, Screwtape Demon.

King fight, now queen fight. I don't understand how female fighting is arousing. Don't get me wrong: I want to be aroused.

Closes out with court intrigue more than usual. Still Alice in Wonderlandy.

This isn't the only stone kingdom in the show. =)

Why does the demon do the right thing?

Una gave sex talk, but not her own mother.

Meh. Not sure it is worth another season.
