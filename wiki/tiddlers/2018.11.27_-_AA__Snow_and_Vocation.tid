How's your day going? =)

Pretty good —-it’s been snow flurries most of the day but not enough to impact travel. It’s pretty though

How’s your day?

Same. Just a light dusting of snow.

Mountains look really pretty with it, heavier snow on top...fades out.

My day's fine. Mountains of paperwork for my minimum wage job. Have to pay out of pocket for the background test, physical, and drug screen. I have never had to do that before.

Weird that they would require so much

I have several opinions about why, hehe

Hopefully, I will be given almost free reign.

Will be interested to read it

That would be good —you could really help out some kidlets
4 HR AGO
Aye. I am pleased to have the job for that.

Sometimes it doesn’t matter how much you get paid but how much you can give... :blush:

In this case, we need to money. Hehe. I strongly agree to claim that we largely do not own ourselves as individuals. We are morally obligated to serve each other in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons. I am honored to have the chance to teach, even if I'm not paid what I deserve. I really do think it's part of my vocation.

Teachers —most of them feel that way
