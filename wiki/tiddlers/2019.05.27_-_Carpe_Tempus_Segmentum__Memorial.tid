title: 2019.05.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Memorial

* Woke at 8
* Med
* Continued work on the door
** It's still too soft. I push it in and add another layer. It's not ready for finishing yet.
* I spent several hours cleaning up the corner, re-wiring, and setting up the shelf. It looks good, and it's functional.
** It's lovely to have such a clean desk and so much space. It is pure luxury.
* Kids and I talked about work on socialization and power dynamics. Being good with homo sapiens isn't going out of style.
** I simply can't give them the path to significant competitive advantages on this front. I'm incompetent and/or unwilling to be immoral. I can help them. 
* My offspring are doing lots of cleaning, organizing, setting up machines, and upkeep. Today is not a normal school day.
* Fitness Routine
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Read+Write
