Hey, I saw your comment. This is just a shot in the dark (if 1 in 100 work out, that's fine with me). I'm an autist who is interested in connecting with others, especially other autistic individuals. I agree that beliefs are the basis for bonding. I realize forming accurate theories of mind may not be our bailiwick. I have a tool I use to help people get to know me. If you are you interested: https://philosopher.life/.
