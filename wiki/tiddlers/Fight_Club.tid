//Pick your fights wisely.//

* The anticommodification message of the novel/movie is ironically commodified.
** Capitalism neutralizes the subversive mediums which would criticize it; capitalism commodifies dissent.
** Charitably, I take it to be a virus wrapped like a self-referential trojan horse.

* Capitalism alienates people from themselves, their labor, and the effort-based stories of authenticity they would otherwise be able to tell themselves about who they are.
** You are just a cog in a machine and mere means to someone else's power. 
** The primacy of persons to things is reversed; almost everyone becomes objectified through the centralization of power.

* Hyperindividualism leads to the collapse of relationships. There is no pursuit of [[The Other]].
** Pursuing oneself conceptually requires pursuing another version of you, and hence pure individualism leads to a contradiction in how we can bind ourselves together as [[4DID]]'s. 
** Capitalism is a failure of individualism; our identities are narratives which require [[The Other]] to help us tell our own stories.

* Like a mass hallucination, manic consumption is the primary mode by which people construct the semblance of an identity.
** Conversely, Durden prescribes ascetic enlightenment and anti-individualism. Denying the individual self [[irwartfrr]] is exactly what enables us to live meaningful lives as individuals.

* Deconstructive political action is the only method of constructive progress. 
** [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]]
** Ironically, postmodernism is itself the perfection of deconstruction to the point that no meaningful construction can be had.
*** Postmodernism is a metanarrative that destroys all metanarratives, including itself.
**** Like //Fight Club//, postmodernism is self-destruction paradoxically motivated to be constructive.
** Distinctions between high and low culture/art/context collapsed; hierarchies of power and symbol are destabilized.

* Quintessential unreliable narrator: the main characters are fragmented and fractured narratives. 
** //Fight Club// is postmodern because it demonstrates the inability of agents to organize autobiographies of themselves into coherent persistent identities.
** Perpetual dejavu, time dilation, disconnected threads which cannot be woven into a meaningful narrative sequence for the agent; you are never really asleep or awake.
** Flooded by signs, agents cannot coherently locate themselves in the world; they are overwhelmed by meaning until they are desensitized into having no meaning.
** It's a hyperreality of [[pure simulacrum|Simulacra and Simulation]].
*** "copy of a copy of a copy" is also reference of a reference of a reference.
*** Media doesn't reflect our society: it has become our society.
*** Cigarette burn in the film is 4th-wall-breaking tongue-in-cheek winking to being a simulation as well.

* As a "spiritual war," //Fight Club// is about awakening through violence with each other and ourselves.
** [[Wiki Litmus Test]]
** We save and define ourselves through performative fighting.
** Dialectical wrestling is necessitated by [[love]], and the physical manifestation is a reification of the prescriptive ideological meaning.
*** //Fight Club// is oddly a love story.
** With collective action, we must retaliate against evil. That is how we define ourselves as [[good]]. We have to fight for what matters before golem devours us.
** It's a celebration of pain; sometimes burns give us meaning.
** Sadomasochistic definition of masculinity is still banal! 
*** We can still look at the physical violence and find it ironically meaningless as well.
*** Fighting is necessary, but what ought we fight for?
** Even scars on our bodies are signs that we are persistent identities.
** We are returned to primal beasts who come alive when we intimately fight and fuck. 
*** Effective cognition requires releasing and relying upon non-cognitive components of our minds.
