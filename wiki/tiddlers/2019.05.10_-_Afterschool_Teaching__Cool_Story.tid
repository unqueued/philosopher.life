title: 2019.05.10 - Afterschool Teaching: Cool Story

I did all the prep. Matt and Whitney came late. 

No homework for anyone, and it is projected that no one will have any.

Two students got suspended for refusing to hand over and unlock their phones. I don't blame them. Delp and Matt consider this to be a plague on the school. I think it is a matter of authority for them rather than something they have carefully reasoned through. 

I walked around and talked with students who would speak with me. 

6AB is 200 pages into the book he bought, and he's grabbing another to read. I showered the boy with praise.

7Sf and I have been talking about how it's weird the way in which she is so involved in the lives of her teachers via brown-nosing, but she doesn't even know what her parents do for a living. I've been teasing her quite a bit about it, but she figured it out. She is oddly misanthropic and slick AF at the same time.

5CM and I had a long conversation about his life. He's excited to travel, and he is dead tired. I talked about holding our breath to wake up (not the most pleasant way).

I took most of the students to the lab. Every single person voted for the lights to be dimmed. Geeks after my own heart. That's exactly how one should work on their computers. I added the repetitive music, but I didn't have any magic pills for us to munch. We had a good time though.

7Af and I talked about digital art, dragons, and the social work her mother does. We talked about her siblings as well.

The lab folks and I talked about browser hotkeys. Everyone was well behaved. 

5NP was being an over-the-top asshole to Whitney. I pulled him aside and demanded he apologize.

7Jm walked around pregnant or with fake tits doing his usual thing. Mitchell said this is miles better than last year. Awesome. The kid swore in front of one of the parents, and she was offended. Matt said he was going to curbstomp the kid. This is just a game to him, clearly. The kid said "shit" underneath his breath because his mom was late yet again (and clearly knows his parents barely care about him at all; he's been trying to reach them for an hour). Let him off the hook on that one.

We talked about absolutist language and thinking about the negative and positive aspects of our day. Matt and Whitney realized what I had said and chimed in to support the claim. 

Matt has decided to lie about having a gay brother today. When questioned, he couldn't come up with good answers and had the body language of someone who was lying. He was attempting to reach out to one of my students. Whitney was bothered by the lie too, though she didn't let it go. In any case, cool story, bro.

Matt also told us about how he deals with anyone who is even rumored to use cannabis. It's straight up manipulative.
