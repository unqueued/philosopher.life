title: 2019.02.14 - Afterschool Teaching: Cut Short

I walked in with Daniel(?) D. I'm trying to be useful and personable. It must be tough to be a smart, gay, fat, black man in this school. Nobody will say anything about it, but I can see the prejudice here and there. We connected on the humanities; listening to him, I think he does give a shit about those in need (though I cannot say to what [[dok]] or with how much consistency). Whitney more naturally attached to him because they are in similar boats.

My wife's biological male donor died. I finished prep, told them I had to go, talked to Delp (who said he understood), and I left to comfort my love. Also, note to self: that traffic sucks.
