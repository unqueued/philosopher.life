title: 2018.10.08 - Self-Dialectic: Hegel and Marx

This really is a Hegelian spirit bomb. I'm going to launch a nuke at dark-triadic genetics and memetics in human history with this wiki. It may be an utter failure, but I have to try. I'm on a philosophical crusade. I'm building a highly transmittable memetic cure. This growing monolith must be contagiously excellent inside me in order for it to burst into the hivemind of the world.
