Of course it's extremely easy to say, the heck with it. I'm just going to adapt myself to the structures of power and authority and do the best I can within them. Sure, you can do that. But that's not acting like a decent person. You can walk down the street and be hungry. You see a kid eating an ice cream cone and you notice there's no cop around and you can take the ice cream cone from him because you're bigger and walk away. You can do that. Probably there are people who do. We call them "pathological." On the other hand, if they do it within existing social structures we call them "normal." But it's just as pathological. It's just the pathology of the general society.

Preach, yo! `/kisses-your-feet` 

What [[Saint Chomsky]] is so brilliantly illustrating is a classic distinction between description and prescription, as well as the dangers of conflating them. It's true that almost no one (or, in fact, no one) has the power to directly and radically change society all by themselves, but it's profoundly false to claim you have absolutely no power or influence in most cases (though plenty of people have near zero). Various [[dok]] of freedom obtain, and you don't have a right to assume the world is immutable to you. You have a moral responsibility to fight and construct heaven on Earth. 

Note, I'm in favor of subversive and clandestine attacks from within when absolutely necessary. That is not what he means at all here. Most people compromise their moral integrity to hedonically integrate into capitalism.
