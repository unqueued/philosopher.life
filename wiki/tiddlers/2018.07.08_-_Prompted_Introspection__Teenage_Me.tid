title: 2018.07.08 - Prompted Introspection: Teenage Me

!! What would you write in a letter you could send back in time to yourself as a teen-ager?

I'd send him this wiki with likely the Windows and Linux executables necessary to read it (assuming that is possible).

I swear to goddess, Samwise, this wiki is sometimes just the best shield "shutdown answer" to your questions. But, I'm obligated to flesh it out.

I would probably have to write an introduction to my future self for my teenage-self. That's doable. The {[[Vault]]} would be a very strong tool. Obviously, I'd be sending myself all the Lottery numbers, hacks,  groundbreaking mathematics and computation, and stock market indicators. I'd load myself up, of course. But, at the end of the day, the philosophical and personal aspects of my wiki would help with that young man's real problems, I [[hope]].

As Josiah pointed out, I am writing to a [[Putative Junior Should Benefit From]]. In a sense we give advice to our past selves. Cultivating the right chain of [[redpills]] and [[diamonds]] would require a great deal of thought. Crucially, however, I cannot actually send this letter, and thus I write a letter to myself!

Pay attention, [[h0p3]].
