title: 2018.03.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: First Kiss

!! Tell about your first kiss.

Presumably, you mean my first sexual kiss. It's difficult to know exactly what counts as sexual. I played truth or dare in 6th grade with the neighbor girls, Krystal Wilson and Caren Cox.<<ref "1">> They weren't very long kisses. Both girls lived tragic lives, I'm sad to say. We were all really fucking poor. I know Krystal was dead by 20, and I think Caren went into the military. I wish I could thank these kind people in a way they would understand. There were really some of my first friends.
