title: Life of Fred: Honey (Elementary Series)

The kids took longer to do this. It was a Saturday though. Volume, measurements, polygons, and a deeper look into subtraction and multiplication. I do not understand the emphasis on cardinality, but I'm not a mathematician. This book was a lot like the last, perhaps too much so to point of feeling glacial, though highly integrated. I wish I could see the author's personal outline for the books in general. 

We have two more books to cover to finish off the "Elementary Series." We're going slower than I'd have liked. We will do our best, and even if we stopped right now, I'd be happy. This is pure gravy, and we're going to soak as much of it as we can.
