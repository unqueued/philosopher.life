//I dedicate this page to myself. I'm actually proud of myself for the good work I've done on this wiki. I hope to help my children learn how to honestly speak and empathically listen to themselves much earlier in life than I did.//

We need to set aside time to explore each others wikis. We need to provide constructive feedback. We should offer suggestions. We should provide encouragement. We should tell them what we like about what they are doing. We should show our commitment to each other. This is a place to celebrate each other, to brainstorm with each other, to help each other, and to get to know each other.

I honestly wish I could read what my brothers thought. I think this would be a very useful tool for them as well, and it is a way for us to connect beyond phone conversations, video conferencing, and messaging.
