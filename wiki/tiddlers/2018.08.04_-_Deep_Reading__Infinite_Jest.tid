What I said to [[L]]:  You should consider reading 50 pages of that book and stop reading afterwards, that way you've experienced it, and know what's not worth reading about it. I'm literally finishing this book because I want to have finished it, not because I enjoy it. It's literally so I can say how much I hated the book, lol.
