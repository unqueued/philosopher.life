h0p3 -

I'm sorry to have taken awhile to reply - and this isn't a reply to 'Hyperconversations' - I will get around to that - this is just a little personal letter. I have no doubt that you will post this on your wiki - and you certainly can, but I would like to encourage you not to. :D

It's funny, when I think of writing you, I am always aware that it will be public - which shouldn't matter, no one would read it anyway - but someone could. In fact, hold up - EVERYONE COULD! AAAAA! And that uncertainty makes me put on a 'hat' so I can go outside. That 'hat' is fashionable but unassuming; it casts a shadow over my eyes.

I had a conversation with my son a month ago. He was asking me why he can't have a YouTube account. It was late at night. We were lying on his bed in the dark. (I don't really want to tell you I have a son. If this were a private e-mail and I knew that I had your complete confidence, there would be no risk, no reservations. But there is risk. So I'll take the risk.) My son - he is young and he can't have a YouTube account. He was telling me about a girl in his class who had a YouTube account. I knew this girl - I had her in my class - I thought to myself that she would be good at making videos. I thought to myself that my son would be good at making videos.

I asked him how he would feel if there was a camera in the corner. There, in the dark, a camera. Broadcasting live. Could we have this conversation? Well, not even that - maybe we could have the conversation. But how would it feel?

Maybe there is a camera in the corner. I knew that my phone was far away - in a drawer across the house. Maybe there are other phones, toys, refrigerators. Who knows!

It didn't feel like there was a camera though. It felt like it was just he and I. The conversation was ours. My side of the conversation was for him, only him. Maybe his side was for me, only me. And maybe a government camera wouldn't change that. But what if it was _my_ camera... my secret camera...

The remarkable thing about your wiki is that you have turned your camera on. In fact, your wiki is defiantly personal - I think it goes beyond a mere camera. Your history. Your conversations. Your letter to your parents. Your thoughts about people - about me. A person can turn on a camera and never say these things. You are on to something. I have no desire to talk you out of it. And I have no desire to do it myself - I wouldn't know where to begin.

What I do want to find out is what you will do with this e-mail. Do you publish it on principle? Do you publish it because the intrigue of the conversation is valuable and needs to be exposed? Do you publish it for hits? Should we be having this conversation on our sites to get some hits? Or do you keep it to yourself - simply because it's clearly for you, only you?

Yeah, ok, we'll start there. Take care!
