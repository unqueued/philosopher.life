title: 2019.02.12 - Seeking Sphygmus: Sky is a Limit

`/gasp` - I'm back up out of the deep ocean (I think, right?). I think I'm catching my breath still.

I wonder what kinds of projects matter to her and where she is going with her coding. Webdev seems obvious enough, and that may be the foot in the door for her. I do not know. This is an area of my life I have failed in. It is best that I am an observer since I cannot trust my own contribution (though, ironically [and horrifyingly], I'm forced to do so for my offspring). 

Those bots sound fun to me! I like bots. I enjoy watching bots too! I don't know enough to be useful to her here. I'm still interested in watching her grow though.

The Awareness Log is a Realtalk^^tm^^ Badass Titan project. [[YWSOAM]]. If the [[Review]] is one of the legs to stand on, the Awareness log might be at the heart or brain...it's core! It is rare that I read something 5 times and still do not feel qualified to say something about it. That must be one of the most emotionally difficult sections to write (it would be for me).

I wish I could give her a hug. God damn! [[Sphygmus]] is sometimes profoundly lonely. I realize everyone has that sometimes, but some far more than others. I also realize that cannot always be fixed, especially when you stand on particular ends of bellcurves in which so few candidates exist for being there with you in the first place. 

There is digestion of at least the past decade of her life here. From my own experience, I'm having a hard enough time just keeping my head above water in the present, let alone digesting the past (which is why {[[Vault]]} is...not my favorite...imho). This might be one of those things that takes decades, an evolving story of how we tell ourselves the stories of who we were (and thus, to some extent, are).

I am complicating to the process. That is not necessarily bad or wrong, but it weighs something. I'm going to say it again: my goal is to be useful to her. That's it. Until I understand otherwise, even in my {[[dreams]]}, I believe I'm looking for the parts she needs to help her make her talisman. Where are the [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]] in the desert which serve her best? That gem-constructed talisman is a naming perception-tool.

The Skyrim explosions are wonderful. It's not a game I've ever played, but I've seen plenty of it (and know many that adore it). I think it's a damned good example of how to use TW too.
