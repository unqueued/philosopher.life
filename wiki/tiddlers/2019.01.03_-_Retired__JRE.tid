//A profoundly unique friend in my life. I could not imagine life without him.//

JRE is the older of my two younger brothers.<<ref "t">> I love that we three brothers can talk about anything with each other.<<ref "a">> Besides my wife, he is my best friend. We share a great deal in common. We talk often, and we understand each other quite well. JRE and I were born 17 months apart, which made us competitive peers and playmates with secret languages. I can't say I was a good brother growing up,<<ref "b">> but I have legitimately tried to be the best brother to him that I can since his divorce many years ago.<<ref "m">>

My brother thinks he lives in my shadow, that he is a response to me, and that his life would be radically different (I don't know if that means better or worse) without me in his life. I agree I am a polarizing figure in people's lives, a man of dialectical extrema. Part of this is the result of the parenting dynamics we grew up with (outside my control), but I accept responsibility for the pain I've caused him. I've apologized many times for it, and I still will. I have failed to morally empathize with my brother on too many occassions. I'm still working on it. I've got to help my brother find himself as he sees best.

Since losing our Christian faiths, in coming to see the world for more like what it truly is, in escaping the decades long cultic gaslighting and manipulation of our donors, we've struggled to come up with effective ways to solve our existential crises and practical life concerns.<<ref "c">> My brother was the inspiration for giving me the courage to lose my faith, and I am forever grateful to him for it. We have held onto each other in the foxhole, attempting to support each other in the whirlwind around us. We became broken shells together, but we both help put each other's humpties back together. He probably doesn't fully grasp it, but I owe him my life several times over.

My brother has called me his canary and his oracle. I aim to tell him my picture of the world and ourselves as best as I can see and express it. One thing I deeply appreciate about my brother is his willingness to wrestle with me. He sharpens me and my models. He deftly changes my mind with reason, and he curates salience for me. I'm often unintentionally a shitty-mean wrestler, and I must make it up to him. I can tell he really does love me. I hope to continually repay and earn my brother's respect through my honesty, effort, and empathy, especially because I respect him for those very reasons.

One of the deepest asymmetries in our relationship is in regards to my children. My brother is such a good uncle, and I can't repay him for it. I talk about my children with him all the time, and he regularly finds way to improve my children's lives in ways that I can't. Over and over I have seen him act as a better dad to my children than I am with them, and I feel like such a failure watching him. Few men shame me so effectively. He helps me become a better dad and person; fitting the Epicurean requirement, JRE's presence calls forth my best. I'm lucky to have him in my life.

My brother is truly an amazing person. It is precisely that he fights against his dark-triadicism which makes him a profoundly good and wise man in his context. He flees from the title, but I know it whether he would recognize it or not. Sometimes he is my own father.

* Search through the wiki and start grafting my thoughts back into this. I want to be able to think wisely and clearly about who we are.
