title: 2019.05.06 - Wiki Review: Wane

* [[2019.05.05 - Family Log: Eat my wife's skirts]]
** Glad to see him writing for us.
* [[Encrypted: T-Money]]
** `/salute`
* [[2019.04.30 - L: Say It Again]]
** I'm a real pain in the ass to speak with.
* [[2019.05.04 - L: Dedication]]
** I think the one of the reasons my donors hate and fear DnD so much is that it reveals the simulational nature of their deceptive rhetoric and cultic gaslighting.
* [[2019.05.05 - L: Healthy]]
** Healthy != Happy
* [[2019.04.30 - K: Flow the Fuck]]
** Hybridity is a fun word.
** The responsibility of the raconteur
* [[2019.05.01 - K: Audiobooks]]
** Wants to be a writer, but I'm not sure he wants to write beyond the DnD game. Not his goal, I guess? Well, I hope he dives into it.
* [[2019.05.03 - K: House Furnishing]]
** Love the "noice" and "full plate." XD. Speakin blargles with me.
* [[2019.05.05 - K: Wiki Stuff]]
** I meet people who don't do wiki stuff, but that's because they don't use computers. Most of yall have digital presences too. They are profound, heavily siloed, monitored into oblivion, and an affront to your autonomy...but, yeah, you do similar work.
* [[2019.05.03 - JRE: Getting High]]
** Feels like it has been waning.
* [[2019.05.05 - JRE: Tubes]]
** No interest in talking.
* [[2019.04.29 - T-Money: DNR]]
** I still need to get a DNR plastered on me. I don't think I'm going to fail though.
* [[2019.04.30 - T-Money: Cold Beer]]
** What the f*** was that?
* [[2019.05.02 - T-Money: Infection]]
** I am that bear.
* [[2019.05.03 - T-Money: Benzos]]
** Capitalism but with safety nets, right? Ugh.
* [[2019.05.04 - T-Money: Relentless]]
** [[T-Money]] reminds me of [[kicks]] in this move.
* [[2019.05.05 - /b/]]
** In [[/b/]] you stay. The idea continues to grow.
* [[2019.05.05 - TDL: Pragma]]
** Okay, so it's clear that most of what I actually do in the day never makes it in here. It's like the stuff I've already modeled and assumed has no bidness.
* [[2019.05.05 - Prompted Introspection: Meauwilke]]
** That is short and still somehow conversational to me. 
* [[2019.05.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: And...go.]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.05.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Manufacturing Consent]]
** Edited.
** Annoyingly, the [[gem]] is larger than what I've written. Ugh.
* [[2019.05.04 - JRE: One-Sided]]
** Lexapro? Maybe. That it takes work to interpret my retardation is, of course, quite draining.
* [[2019.05.05 - Self-Dialectic: Dasein]]
** Been a while, old friend.
