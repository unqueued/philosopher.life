title: 2010.09.16 - Normative Assertibilist Theory

Brandom distinguishes between two camps of theorists concerning the pragmatic methodological notion that “the point of the theoretical association of meanings with linguistic expressions is to explain the use of those expressions.” 1 The divide is based upon whether or not one should use normative terminology to describe the relationship between meanings and the sentences expressing them. Either way, both camps will need to provide some account of assertability.

Brandom sides with one camp, claiming that we need to use normative vocabulary in order to properly describe this “basic pragmatist methodological thesis.”<<ref "2">> Interestingly, while Brandom says we should use normative vocabulary in this instance, he does not rule out the possibility of an eventual naturalistic account which can reduce the theory to a process described in vocabulary which isn’t normative.<<ref "3">>

So, what does it mean for an assertability theory to normatively describe the relationship between sentences/expressions and the proposition contents which they express? It is to show why and how a speaker can appropriately express something. The normative vocabulary describes a speaker’s entitlement to the claims they make, providing rules for when an assertion is allowable, correct, or how it ought to be used in circumstances.

Brandom draws an analogy of the problem which the assertability theorist must describe to being something like defining a game. He claims the first part of the problem is defining what it means to make an assertion. His game analogy to this first half of the assertabilist theory is “distinguishing different kinds of moves in a game[…]punting, bidding, castling, betting, and so on.”<<ref "4">> The second half of the problem is providing the normative boundaries for assertions directly. His game analogy is put as, “saying when moves of the specific kind are permitted.”<<ref "5">>
