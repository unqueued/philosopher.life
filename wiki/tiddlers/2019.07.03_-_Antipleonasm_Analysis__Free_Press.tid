title: 2019.07.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Free Press

!! Respond to the following gem:

The moment we no longer have a free press, anything can happen. What makes it possible for a totalitarian or any other dictatorship to rule is that people are not informed; how can you have an opinion if you are not informed? If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer. This is because lies, by their very nature, have to be changed, and a lying government has constantly to rewrite its own history. On the receiving end you get not only one lie — a lie which you could go on for the rest of your days — but you get a great number of lies, depending on how the political wind blows. And a people that no longer can believe anything cannot make up its mind. It is deprived not only of its capacity to act but also of its capacity to think and to judge. And with such a people you can then do what you please.

I seek freespeech; we are each potential presses and audiences. I am opposed to capitalist media enterprises, and I don't think corporations are agents which have a right to freespeech. It depends on what you mean by free press. Do I think they have a justified political (not even talking about moral) right to serve as a mouthpiece and mind-control tool of centralized power? No. It's not that anything can happen, it's that centralized power maintains its grip.

I can't even convince IT professionals that the basic protocols and infrastructure of the internet are wrong enough to merit replacement. They call the internet decentralized, but it comes in [[dok]]. Internet infrastructures continue to centralize inside and out. Fewer and fewer people own their digital identities, their computers, their communities, and themselves. Even mesh networks sit in grey areas of the law unless they are ISP owned last mile or repeaters for your wifi. I must sound like a tinfoil Libertarian quack (and I despise Libertarianism) to them. I don't have the rhetorical piece of paper which grants me authority in the eyes of most folks either. I feel a bit like I'm part of the Cassandra Choir.

Being informed is really hard work. I don't read as much as I should, but I drown in information. People aren't informed because they must trust others to calculate on their behalf to digest what would otherwise be hyperobjects for an individual. Low-trust societies eliminate the decentralized patterns for acting as neurons in communities with each other. A capitalist press preys upon that lack of trust in uncovering the nature of hyperobjects, making postmodernism even more nightmarish.

We are mere thinclient terminals to capitalists gods. Indeed, no one believes anything any longer unless it suits them (did they ever?). 

The Orwellian claim is screaming out of Arendt. I consider it a problem in the moral philosophy of language. Autonomy is restricted by our languages. The weak Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis is correct, and it is abused heavily. The Stack is huge, and it requires us all to organize and reassemble it to resemble us more fittingly. The lack of wisdom is a mental illness which perpetuates itself so insidiously.
