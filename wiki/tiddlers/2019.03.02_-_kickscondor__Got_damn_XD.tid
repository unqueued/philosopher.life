>Oddly enough, my favorite part of this site is just the background. Love the balls, and I wish the web moved back to it.

Got damn generosity! Can’t believe you went through all these links, brother. I was watching this go down many weeks ago and just in awe. I mean it’s taken years to collect these links. Now you’re slamming them down like cans of baked beans.

You passed off a bunch of the zine and lit mag stuff to k0sh3k. This got me to pay closer attention to her wiki. Friend-o, I think I’ve bailed on yours to read hers. It’s a trove!

>    20 May, 2018: Today, h0p3 was wrong… He claimed I had a list of 11 books for him to read, but I only had 10. I even told him there were only 10 on the list, but he was quite sure there were 11. There are only 10, though.

This is XD. Love her quotes collection—it rivals yours. I appreciate the papers she links to, and I’ve liked discovering things like [[John Ayliff’s site|http://www.johnayliff.com/]] and the [[Dante’s Inferno Topography|https://www.alpacaprojects.com/inferno/en/]]. Tell her I’d be interesting in seeing more of her fiction recommendations—not just novels, but any short stories or poems she’s encountered.

//(Actually, for both of you: what would you add to href.cool—like given everything else I’ve linked to, what notable omissions are there??)//

Oh and I am most intrigued (and grateful) for her pages on homeschooling. For me, this is an ideal. I don’t work in public school because I feel it’s an ideal—it’s just the common experience, so it’s very important. But if every kid could have the freedom to learn at home and have the guidance of their parents—man, that is a dream. I do follow a similar schedule to hers during the summer with my kids. (I must highly recommend Kieran Egan’s //The Educated Mind//—this book is not some tips-and-tricks book, it backs you out from all that to look at wtf we’re doing. I would bet it’ll confirm some things for her.)

I also love that she says “blargle” just like you. Come on—she writes it in the same way with the same letters. It hits with the same quality.

Feels weird that I’m addressing you rather than her. I figure that if she wants to reply on her wiki, then it’ll be a real conversation. Otherwise, you can just pass on my sentiments. (This is one of the interesting things about this format where we’re openly conversing—not on a forum or on an e-mail list, but just by loose association on the web—this isn’t a conversation where I can sense who’s in on it. Compare this with some of the conversations that your bookwyrm has had lately—with people dropping in and chatting her face off from [[time to time|http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/#Friday%2C%2015%20February%202019]]. She can choose to read this on her own time, listen to it or ignore it, maybe continue it. That such an advantage and I will gladly trade that for the uncertainty of whether it actually ever reaches her.

I also feel a bit like I end up talking about you and Sphyg and the other self-modelers out there, without considering that this is a family effort for you all. And your whole house is doing a bang-up job showing how to participate in each other’s lives in this way.

Can you tell me—am I okay to link to the other wikis in your family? Like on href.cool and on my home page? I feel like they are designed to be a bit more private, but perhaps I’ve invented that.
