* [[2019.03.17 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Roughly Speaking]]
** Edited.
** That one got particularized in an unexpected direction.
* [[2019.03.17 - Prompted Introspection: Sportsball]]

** My daughter is hilarious.
* [[2019.03.17 - Wiki Review: Peeps]]
** [[Sphygmus]] continues to be quiet. That sucks, but she said that would happen. Well, I will rejoice when I get to see her and remember her when I don't.
* [[2019.03.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: DCK]]
** Completed.
** Well, it may be helping. I find the k-hole to be traumatic; sometimes trauma is the only way to fix it. No pain, no gain.
* [[2019.03.17 - TDL: Board]]
** No, she really isn't feeling well enough, and she is stupid busy. 
*** Stahp.
* [[2019.03.17 - T-Money: Compliments]]
** I appreciate compliments. I am often skeptical of them as well. Needs to be a good mix, I think.
* [[2019.03.12 - T-Money: Disability]]
** I can appreciate his cleverness. I think he's good at lying to himself.
* [[2019.03.15 - T-Money: Bedrest]]
** After dealing with the pain, I assume it's a kind of vacation? We deserve vacays.
*** He will fail to recognize his privilege in capitalism.
* [[2019.03.16 - T-Money: Million Dollar Idea]]
** He seems to want to climb that dying ladder. I'm glad we have something cool to talk about.

** Reminds me of connecting with some of my kids at work.
* [[2019.03.16 - AG: Good. Not Good.]]
** It's an interesting issue. She doesn't seem comfortable talking with anyone over chat. We're her first, IIRC. Well, I aim to be useful to her.
* [[2019.03.13 - JRE: Cabal]]
** I still have no answer to the emergent question. That might be right. What would non-emergent cabals mean though?
* [[2019.03.16 - JRE: Drywall]]
** Wrestling! Good. 
* [[2019.03.12 - AA: Party]]
** Fairly empty week.

** Games are a language game for us.
* [[2019.03.15 - Tasha: Matt's Job]]
** Surface.
* [[2019.03.14 - Sho: Brexit]]
