!! What does death teach us about life?

/yawn

I've not yet died, so I can't tell you what my death will teach me. I'm convinced there won't be a "me" anymore to learn anything in the first place. Our own deaths do not teach us anything directly. We see the deaths of others and we know each of us will die. Those facts have a profound impact on how we think about our existence.

Carpe Diem, making it count, etc. is a fine start. The fear of death is a non-trivial force in our lives. I think death forces us to reckon with how we value our own lives and the lives of others. Unfortunately, it seems like after we nail the basics down (which the vast majority agree to), it doesn't seem like there is much agreement on what else we ought to learn from death. I see much of my wiki has wrestling with this meaning of life (and thus death, in the dialectic). If I knew the answer outright, I'd tell you.
