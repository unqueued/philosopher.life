title: 2018.12.27 - Be A Good Dad: Time

Sometimes I write this wiki in the [[hope]]s that one day you will read and study it to {[[help]]} you contemplate me, yourself, and the world. I have told you before that it is evidence before [[The Moral Courtroom]].

It sometimes feels like I'm writing to you 20 years from now when you'll be my age. How does an autistic father communicate everything he must communicate about the desert to his children in the timeframe he has and with the resources at his disposal? This is my ugly hack against time, [[1uxb0x]] and [[j3d1h]]. I don't know if it's going to work. I have to try.

It is unfairly unidirectional right now. Maybe in my dotage and spiral into insanity, you will be able to summon and remind me as an IRL person or interpret who I was through my wiki. I do not know. This might all be useless to you too. I have a hard time believing that.
