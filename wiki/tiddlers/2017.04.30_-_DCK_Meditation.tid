title: 2017.04.30 - DCK Meditation

I need a dream section on my wiki. I'm throwing some caution to the wind today, but I'm too lucid and capable of typing while on DCK not to. Therefore, I am sorry, but the DCK meditation is actually embedded in the wiki itself today. You will need to look through the snapshots to see the structural changes I'm trying to make. Crazy wild man on drugs changing his wiki here. Yup. It's important that I can literally change anything while on DCK. That's part of how it works.

Essentially, I need happier parts of my wiki. I've got plenty of brutal honesty. I've even got practical metamodern work. I don't have enough dreams on here. Dreaming is part of being human.<<ref "1">>

Fred de Rosset. I need to learn more about this man. We need closure. He is incredibly gifted with language (My God, Man). He may even be a genius. I know it when I see it. He is an empath. He may reject me out of hand. I don't know. I think Fred de Rosset was obviously in the world I was interested in, but he did it narratively and...

I was so lucky to go to Berea. God damn. It changed me forever. Transformation.

I should develop a relationship with Fred de Rosset. Maybe not. He has the missionary kid background to understand. If he could see my autism, he would get it. 

Here is my worry, he would completely fail to understand me entirely. I know I am brilliant. *cackle* No, but for real, I'm straight up weird brilliant. These men changed my life. 

Of course, my son doesn't have to be like me. We know that. How do I help him become the best him? The happiest him? How do I 

Am I jousting with a figment of Fred de Rosset? Does he understand? Will he?

There are very few people who are qualified to understand the entirety of me. For real. It's just a fact. People can be reductive and try to define me, but they can't. Fred was brilliant. I saw it. Before my very eyes. These professors were like gods to my wife and I. The status redpilled relationship godlike structure thing is gross. whatever. move past it. The fact is that these people were our idols.

Idol is such an interesting word. It looks funny. *drug-addled* ** paranoia**

My idol, unfortunately, Fred de Rosset was not who I wanted him to be. That's not his fault. That's not my fault either. It is what it is.

I want to note that I am typing cleanly enough on DCK today. This is very interesting.

DCK is the spark of randomness. When we dissociate, we can step outside of ourselves, walk around the building of who we are (in an oversimplified, infantile sense) and
