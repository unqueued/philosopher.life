title: Autism

Beyond my obvious genetic predisposition (it runs in the family), my abnormalities and inabilities to effectively form theories of mind at a gutteral level in my rTPJ, my systematizing abilities and proclivities, my difficulties in communication, my oversensitivities, and a lifetime of very odd quirks demonstrate my autism. 

I am lucky enough to be able to intellectualize my social life to the point that I'm high-functioning. To some minimal extent, I can "blend in" and be normal with others and even to some extent feel normal myself while doing it. But, upon any minimal investigation, it is clear that I do not fit in almost anywhere or with anyone (barring rare exceptions) with enough depth or integration.<<ref "1">> 

Every single friendship that has lasted required someone who was highly empathic and intelligent enough to understand me, which is necessary to empathize with me. It's why my wife, [[k0sh3k]] is the One, my truest friend. My wife was raised with an autistic savant (and she might be a milder one herself; she's certainly on the spectrum, see: [[k0sh3k's autism]]), and she has always spoken my language fluently and effortless at every turn. In fact, I seemed normal to her in ways that don't make sense (and probably vice versa). I get along with her because she gets along with autistic people (which is also an explanation for how she has long 

It's why MB is one of "the others" to me, a real friend. She gets me, and that's because she is: intelligent, comes from a similar background as mine, and her brother is a diagnosed high-functioning autistic person. We click because she speaks my language, because she is capable of empathizing with me, and I with her. She doesn't judge me. Contrast this to my father (whom I love deeply; I want to repair our relationship).

When my dad says he won't "revolve" around me, I think it's because he has a hard time empathizing with me. I don't think this is due to lacking any standard intelligence (he is a brilliant man in my eyes). I have seen his intellectual prowess, his triumphs and mistakes;<<ref "2">> both require impressive intelligence.<<ref "3">> He is obviously incredibly smart and works hard to understand the world. He's a contrarian and a traditionalist at the same time; he is someone who tends to make me think there are still a handful of conservatives who are neither evil nor fools (a diamond, no doubt).

I think he doesn't understand me though. This may have to do with my autism. It is also obvious that he has serious problems empathizing with others (but not everyone; sometimes he is a very deep empathizer; it depends on a number of factors). He could easily be on the autism spectrum. I am strongly convinced he isn't significantly psychopathic (we are all literally on that spectrum; that's what it means to be a sinner), despite mixed abilities to empathize with me. I think [[Adult Children of Alcoholics]], particularly about having not received empathy himself in much of his life, is one of the keys to understanding who he is though. 

Outside of the the basic homo sapien mammalian stuff (are you experiencing hunger pain?, do you enjoy the feel of the music?, and other fundamental emotions and feelings which we all tend to experience) few empathize with me, and I think that's because they do not see what I see, they cannot step into my shoes, they do not and often cannot make the abnormal kinds of inferences I make (even as they attempt to intuit or gutterally-hypothesize my theory of mind). Sometimes its abnormal for intelligent reasons, and sometimes it isn't. This isn't me stroking my ego; I think it is autism. I am very abnormal (deviant in the normatively-neutral sociological sense). Of course it will be difficult to empathize with someone who is really different. 

I think it is as difficult for for autistic people to empathize with others as it is for others to empathize with autistic people. Our rTPJ's just activate differently. I implore you  to not commit the Humean naturalistic fallacy here: Is does not imply ought. Unfortunately, a charitable interpretation of the Humean Guillotine is true, as far as I can tell (it is an important philosophical tentpeg in this discussion). The myth of normalcy is best understood by this Humean Law. Normal and Normative are obviously not the same.

Admittedly, I don't make it easy to empathize with me either. If EQ were a real thing, or whatever part is real, (the science does not verify the self-help + business literature, but I still think there is something right about the kernel of it [I think Emotional Intelligence is a real thing; it is simply very poorly described in the sciences for a bunch of reasons {but that is changing}]), mine has enormous variance. I'm underdeveloped in my social programming in ways that do not make sense outside of autism. On the Autism Spectrum, I believe I'm somewhere between Asperger's and possibly a mild form of PDD-NOS.

-------------------------------------------------

''What can't I do because I am autistic?''

Being a eudaimonic lifehacker requires being an empathizer, right? That's going to be pretty hard to accomplish when you aren't a good empathizer. I often fail to empathize with myself (see executive functioning problems) and others for many reasons, and I think autism is a significant reason. I do not form theories of mind in the way others do. 

I must still strive to be as empathic as I can. And, at least initially, we should see that the autist empathizes with the wrong representation of someone's of mind, but not that, of course, is that the same thing as saying they don't empathize.

Further, I must accept that I am not a talented empathizer as is standardly conceived. That doesn't mean I don't empathize, but I do it poorly in significant ways. This thing that I seek, I'm genetically (and perhaps memetically-conditioned) to suck at it in important ways (thankfully not all ways!). My failure is not always up to me. It isn't always on my shoulders. I must stoically accept those things which are outside my control. That doesn't mean I'm blameless (although, if you saw what I did in philosophy, you would like take that position up for all human agency). Nobody is perfect.

<<footnotes "1" "I can hear my dad now complaining about those who empathize with themselves. He lacks empathy for himself. I must empathize with him. How else can I accept him?">>

I'm in no place to even delusionally condemn him for something that is obviously a deeper flaw in myself. It's clear I do listen when my dad talks (and mom as equally), although they may not think I do. I have paid very close attention to his arguments, closer than he suspects, imho. I think it is rare that I listen to people, but I do listen to what my parents say. I could not be as hurt by them as I am unless I did (I'm not sure if it goes the other direction, it may). Sometimes I don't want to listen because it hurts. I'm asking them to see why it hurts and empathize. I don't think they will be able to see it. What do I ascribe to this inability to empathize: malice, ignorance, or a lack of moral responsibility? It feels like those are my only options here. One could claim I am in a false-trilemma, but I want to deeply understand the answer which eludes me because it will solve crucial philosophy problems for me (a fundamental source of disunity in me). I don't like any of the options in the trilemma, and I want to be wrong about it.">>
