Good morning, [[L]]. How's it going?
TUE 9:54 
Hey, how's it going?
WED 1:17 PM
It is going. Lots of usual juggling and the stress of spontaneous work. Oh boy!
WED 1:21 PM
Whatcha workin on?
WED 1:21 PM
Mostly work things, but I’m also helping [[K]] with his project (not sure if he told you) and still mulling over how to hold our own game.
WED 1:22 PM
Ah, cool.
WED 1:22 PM
I think I’ve decided I want to web cam a map to you all instead of wrestling with online software.
WED 1:23 PM
That works too
WED 1:23 PM
I would rather draw my own maps than try climbing a huge learning curve for online software
WED 1:24 PM
That makes sense.
WED 1:24 PM
Discord should do us well as far as rolling — I’ve found bots to assist for rolling and even playing music :D
WED 1:24 PM
Plus, handdrawing can be faster and more spontaneous
WED 1:24 PM
Agreed!
WED 1:24 PM
I hope you all don’t mind. I know it’s not exactly the most flashy, but it’s what I’m most comfortable with.
WED 1:25 PM
No, it's your game. We are lucky to be able to participate in it.
WED 1:25 PM
And, we are happy to do it. =)
WED 1:25 PM
So the question is
WED 1:25 PM
Can I convince you all to have a camera or even cameras too?
WED 1:25 PM
We don’t *need* it, but it would be nice I think.
WED 1:26 PM
We can try. I can tell you that at least for [[JRE]] and I, video chat does not feel real enough.
WED 1:26 PM
It feels like a show.
WED 1:26 PM
Honestly, it’s more from a perspective of knowing when my players aren’t paying attention.
WED 1:27 PM
I know some of you can multitask but the kiddos may need to be reigned in every now and then.
WED 1:27 PM
DM = part babysitter, part storyteller, all actor.
WED 1:27 PM
That is a fascinating claim, lol.
WED 1:28 PM
It sounds like you are teaching through rhetoric.
WED 1:28 PM
But, yeah, we'll have video up for the kids at the very least.
WED 1:29 PM
Perfect.
WED 1:29 PM
I suppose you need something like a dangling camera, tripod, or use a whiteboard?
WED 1:30 PM
I have plans on what to use for a camera... I will probably mic myself so no matter where I go you can always hear me.
WED 1:31 PM
But the camera will be on me until map important things happen like battles or puzzles and such
WED 1:32 PM
hm.
WED 1:32 PM
Okay. You know what you're doing. =)
WED 1:32 PM
Maybe you want two cameras?
WED 1:33 PM
My plan is to have a session zero we iron out these things as well as guild “rules” and session rules. We can all get familiar with each other’s characters and maybe even have a demo battle or something to see how it all works.
WED 1:33 PM
I might need two lol
WED 1:33 PM
I have a phone camera... maybe I’ll invest in a wireless camera too
WED 1:34 PM
Mount it to the bookshelf or somethin.
WED 1:34 PM
I don't have an extra camera, sadly.
WED 1:34 PM
Hrm. I do have an extra phone...but it is potato.
WED 1:35 PM
That’s okay! I’ve been wanting one for awhile anyways cause we have a friend that video chats a lot.
WED 1:35 PM
Image attached to message
WED 1:35 PM
I have to say, I am eager to DM for you all but am also crazy nervous about it because my last experience was... rough. But I’ll do my best.
WED 1:38 PM
What made it rough?
WED 1:38 PM
(and, I'm sure you'll do fine: you realize I'm just happy to get together...the game is just the subtext...It reminds me of my wiki quite a bit in [[FTO]], though I'm not pretending there).
WED 1:39 PM
Players that weren’t interested in cooperating with other players, characters that were designed without the premise in mind that made killing things difficult.
WED 1:40 PM
What's your goal babysitting, storytelling, actor?
WED 1:40 PM
I want to provide a space for us all to have fun and make memories. Even if it’s not a long-running thing.
WED 1:41 PM
I like to think of it as one giant experiment where I test ideas for my world and build on the lore [[K]] and I have already made.
WED 1:42 PM
I'll get the ~~scrapbook~~ wiki out.
WED 1:42 PM
Hehehe
WED 1:42 PM
I do actually want to host a small wiki for you all on it.
WED 1:42 PM
My other group loved it a lot, and it would give a small space for you all to look up NPC information on the fly.
WED 1:43 PM
Cool. That will be excellent.
WED 1:43 PM
I sent you a link that might help.
WED 1:43 PM
Sent to [[K]] as well
WED 1:43 PM
I saw! :D
WED 1:43 PM
I will explore it later today >:3
WED 1:43 PM
I think the first few sessions may be difficult... but fun. :>
WED 1:45 PM
Well, hopefully.
WED 1:45 PM
Anyways, enough of my insecurities and indecision. How are you?
WED 1:46 PM
I don't know why you think it will be difficult, lol! Your DnD games must be extravagant in a way I'm not used to, or you are holding yourself to too high a standard. [[L]]. We are going to have fun no matter what.
WED 1:46 PM
I do hold myself to a high standard. I blame... myself I guess. XD
WED 1:46 PM
rofl
WED 1:46 PM
preach, yo
WED 1:47 PM
I have poured myself out (cried a lot to write it) into this letter: https://philosopher.life/#2018.12.13%20-%20kickscondor%3A%20Revelation
WED 1:47 PM
It is still in draft, but nearly complete.
WED 1:47 PM
As an RPer, I think what we're doing is worth your time.
WED 1:48 PM
https://sphygm.us/#To%20h0p3%20and%20Kicks%20-%20I%20Love%20You.

WED 1:49 PM
(You are jumping mid conversation; there's a ton of context missing)
WED 1:50 PM
Yeah, I need to take the time to truly catch up.
WED 1:50 PM
Man I wish I could read faster.
WED 1:51 PM
Dude. His wiki has beep-boops.
WED 1:55 PM
His isn't even wiki. Every scrap of his website is handcrafted from the bottom up. Yeah, he's got the 90's Geocities God going on.
WED 1:56 PM
I love it. That is some SERIOUS commitment
WED 1:56 PM
It's art.
WED 1:56 PM
Also, I think it incredible tender of you to pour yourself so honestly into such a letter. It is clear you care very much.
WED 1:57 PM
Well, I ask you to tenderly read it (however crazy it may appear). That letter does a lot of work.
WED 1:58 PM
Idk if tender is the right word... but I think you get what I mean.
WED 2:00 PM
Also, I like your flavor or crazy. It is strong but not overwhelming. So don’t worry.
WED 2:00 PM
Of* crazy
