!! About:

//Be a moral metagamer, h0p3. Find the Kantian goldilocks zone of selfishness when ends-in-themselves incommensurably and inconsistently compete. This is the work of practical prophets. Actively seek restorative justice over retributive whenever it is rationally justified. Do your part to actualize the world into being exponentially not a zero-sum game as much as possible. To whom much is given, much is required. As a matter of the hedged-conservative pursuit of center of [[The Golden Rule]], the spirit of the law, do your best to extend yourself into mercy beyond mere justice, the justest of all justice frameworks. It is the political law as defined by [[The Moral Law]]. Be a Moralfag Übermensch; provide the ancients' hospitality to all strangers; know who they are, trust them as much as you can, and build relationships worth having.//

This is the principle of social anti-fragility.

I must love others as I love myself, and that means I need to both love others and myself. Striking the correct balance is not easy.

Not everyone is my friend or plays by moral rules, and I need to pick my battles. I need heuristics to help me navigate a world as an autistic person who can't affectively generate accurate theories of minds nor fully appreciate [[The Good]] and [[The Right]]. This practical axiom is an concrete exercise in cognitive empathy. Seek the virtuously normalized reflective equilibrium heuristics of finding the golden mean, [[The Golden Rule]], between two vices: being too selfish and being too selfless.

!!! {''Axiom'': Strike the fitting balance between "turn the other check" altruistic forgiving mercy and an "eye for an eye" selfish self-defense}

On the virtue spectrum, where the golden mean (The Golden Rule) is particularistically located between two vices (one of excess, the other deficiency) in each context, we see:

```
[Empathizing With Others But Not Yourself, Absolute Turn the Other Cheek]-----------[T42T, The Golden Rule]---------[T4T, Selfish, Minimal Moral Cooperation in Overly Idealized Perfect Competition]-------------[Empathizing with Yourself but not Others, Extreme Psychopathy]
```

May this axiom become: The Golden Rule Communicated in the Language of Psychopathic Memeplex-strains Embedded in Current Paradigms of Economics & Philosophy. They are evil metanarratives, and we need profound evidence (if not proof) of it. We should make our best efforts to speak truth of [[The Golden Rule]], the essence of [[The Moral Law]], the [[The Categorical Imperative]], to all cultures, especially psychopathic ones. In the land of the wicked, preach in the wicked person's language.

At the very least, T42T means being more forgiving in the dialectic than my interlocutor (by how much, I do not know). Essentially, the blame of a failure to cooperate must not rest with me. 

This is a satisfying Just War Theory rule of thumb designed to help bounded-rational agents morally navigate the State of Nature which I believe should be chosen behind the Veil of Ignorance. In my pursuit of [[The Golden Rule]], in trying to [[Find The Others]], and in engaging in the Optimal-Decision-Finding Consensus-Based Power-Decentralizing Collective Action of the Kantian Original Position ([[The Golden Rule]]), I do not seek to engage in equivalent retaliation, //lex talionis//, because it is innately too selfish. I want to be better than that.

This strategy is somewhat clear, nicely cooperative in my opening moves, prudentially provocably self-protective, and forgiving in a willingness to resolve conflicts given the right cooperative evidence. This is part of the science of my own happiness in socializing with others. When will I turn the other cheek or give someone another chance? I need employ "Tit for tat with forgiveness," but how much forgiveness? I suppose it will vary in each context, and I must find out as best I can. I must find the golden mean of this golden political rule through anti-luck contextualist epistemology. You are engaged in the [[Redpill]]ed empirical investigations into particularism of that transcendent ideal of the maximally generalized [[Diamond]], [[The Golden Rule]], i.e. you are a mystic anti-luck contextualist fitting the moral law to your context. Find the measure of mean, h0p3.

[[Tit For Two Tats]] is beautifully positioned between absolute grim trigger //lex talionis// and absolute //turn the other cheek//. It's a compromise designed to prevent myself from being exploited while also consistently defeating the unending death spiral resulting from the common fallibility and miscommunications between players engaged in regular old "Tit For Tat." I appreciate how it assumes people commonly make mistakes, which strongly includes myself, and thus it is far more constructive.

I hope my goodwill may generate Swift and spontaneous instances of cooperation, trust-building positive feedback loops, "Christmas Truce[s]," and pockets of "Live and let live" social capital to rise from the exploitative Hobbesian pit. We must escape and defeat the chaos of our social traps, deadlocks, pyrric victories, prisoner's dilemmas, spirals of silence, and the Tragedy of the Commons. We must fairly ration utility in what are otherwise known to be zero-sum games, form intentional communities, and develop maximally mutualist and generous moral economies. I aim to do my part by seeding instances of reinforcing virtuous circles of decentralized cooperation in the barren wasteland of the State of Nature. 

It's important to see that being forgiving at all is fundamentally a losing strategy in totally competitive games. T42T is not the best strategy in capitalism, libertarianism, and objectivism. But, I'd like to think that humans aren't absolutely selfish, or at the least, they are quite imperfect at being selfish to the point that the games we play aren't actually in total competition (even if it often feels like it). There is a chance to memetically and genetically evolve the human species into being good persons.  

It is also easy to take advantage of it if people know you are employing this strategy. All that said, I want to be better than the enlightened self-interest of delayed gratification in social capital trading and gift-economy insurance found in the quid pro quo egoist's strategy, one who only cooperates for the Darwinian evolutionary reason that Kant's Honest Butcher cooperates. The mere symbiosis of Homo economicus lacks moral merit. I will accept the internalized sacrifices necessary to defeat the volunteer's dilemma. I aim to defeat the gladiatorial Darwinian dog-eat-dog problem by doing more than my fair share. I aim not only to be blameless before the moral law, but actually praiseworthy.

I must detect the spectrums and [[dok]] freeriders, psychopaths, etc. while trying to [[Find The Others]]. I also hope to identify and avoid the brinksmanship and mutally assured destruction of games of chicken. This page is a precommitment: a convincing, honest signal of my intentions. We should defuse those irrational Hobbesian minefields. Unfortunately, I sometimes feel the need to put up deterrances, especially against people I have strongly identified as psychopathic. Sometimes, we must accept the [[SO]] grim trigger.

In the end, in trying to [[Find The Others]], in my pursuit of those persons worth my time, I am seeking out other better-than-reciprocal altruists in the world to seed the memetic injection of [seeking better-than-selfishness in iterated prisoner's dilemmas] into humanity's hivemind, and I'm going to take a beating from the psychopaths and mere (or unacceptably irrational) egoists around me to find them. This rule (and to some extent this wiki) mitigates some risk, and it also makes the workload more efficient. I am a pessimist who predicts people aren't going to cooperate, but I feel it my moral duty to dawn my optimism armor and try to cooperate anyways. Let us defuse the "each against all" bomb ticking inside of humanity.

Ultimately, we are too finite to play this game all the way down. Often, we will be in positions where don't get to test each other effectively. How will I approach this? How do I generate faith in humanity outside of this?

I want to point out that Libertarians, on their absolute best moral behavior, are merely arguing for [[T4T]] (and that is generous assessment), while socialists are arguing for [[T42T]] or stronger altruism.
