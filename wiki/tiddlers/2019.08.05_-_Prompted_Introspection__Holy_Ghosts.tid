!! What is your opinion about ghosts?

It is good to see you again, [[Saint Diogenesocrates]]. It is my honor, as always. Please, come in. Can I get you something? Please, engage in dialectics with us. I do not understand enough about the world. Your question is connected with a great number of conversations I'm having right now.<<ref "t">>

I have been told that I am nice (maybe even kind) in how I approach this issue with my friend [[gh057]]. This question forces me to say it straight. I don't believe ghosts exist. I don't believe the paranormal (in any standard conception) obtains. [[The Good]] is metaphysical, and hence I agree to something outside physics, and I even stick my neck out to say our freewill requires a metaphysical basis (since compatibilism is a joke or a fairy tale).<<ref "f">> I am deflationary about metaphysics even as a Platonist though; I aim not to posit one iota more than I must.<<ref "s">> 

I can also see this is a necessary aspect of responding to my friend [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. My [[faith]], which is eventually reduced to mysticism, is a result of recognizing that [[The Good]] is fundamental as a category of conscious experience. There is no [[phenomenology]] without intentionality toward a [[gfwiwcgws]], and we beg the question. The skeptic cannot deny it without causing an exception in his program and freezing up; there is no reason to consider moving forward in our computation without already having assumed it. 

The is/ought arises for the skeptic (which is hardly [[DeathOfRobinhood]]like, a man of profound faith), and the skeptic can still attempt to ask the ill-formed question "why be moral at all?" I get it. I wrestled some monsters here in academic philosophy.<<ref "h">> I'm straight-up begging the question against you just as you beg it against me.

I can see I also have a difficulty here with [[chameleon]] who holds one of my mortal enemies in high regard: [[Meaningness]]. I certainly see the allure. I can also point out the history of his memeplex through a number of traditions. It's like speaking with Cratylus in the end. 

Alright, back to the ghosts: I am not convinced that people are skeptical enough of their own [[phenomenology]]. I say that as a man who has been wrong again and again (and surely still is wrong) in this deep end of the desert. Our pattern-recognition may have been evolutionarily valuable to us in many respects, but we are often wrong. I do not deny that people experience something which they deem mystical or paranormal, but I am not convinced it is an experience "of" something external to them in such a way that it is objectively verifiable.

<<footnotes "s" "Still an incredibly large notion. I do not have anyone I can speak with about it. =( It is my [[hope]] that some [[beautiful]] weirdo who has read enough of the Saints will know what I'm saying (perhaps even kick my ass!).">>
