title: 2017.05.09 - Pipefitting Log

We were fairly productive today. Chris and I finished off an entire leg, including an elbow. We also corrected for Mel and Nash's mistake by minimizing the takeout of the flange on the end to almost nothing. I did the vast majority of the tacking. I used very light tacks to mount, and then I passed over it for 1" tacks that will hold it permanently. 

It was a frustrating day though. Getting everything how we wanted wasn't easy. I wish we had more practice before jumping into it. That said, this second leg went quickly enough, and it looks clean. The teacher was fine with it.

Luke decided to spend his time completely welding our first leg, which prevented us from throwing the elbow on it. The welds were ugly, but even the tacks were ugly before Luke did his work. The teacher wasn't happy about it, and part of it was because the way Luke welded may have warped the flanges. The teacher said he's never actually seen them warp though. I think he just wants to talk down to Luke though. 

We will be lucky to have this completed before the end of the week. It was a larger project than I anticipated. 

I told the teacher I would be leaving early on Friday, and I told him Luke would be helping me.
