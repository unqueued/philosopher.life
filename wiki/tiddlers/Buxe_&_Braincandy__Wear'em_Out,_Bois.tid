!! America: Teacher's Edition

MTG Card Bookmark: Engineered Plague, targeting worldwide crises we face.

It's not like I agree with the book, but it's miles closer. It was an important book for me. I doubt the most important literature on the topic is a book these days. I'm not sure how to capture the problem well enough.

!! Language, Proof, & Logic

MTG Card Bookmark: Monk Realist, targeting Incompleteness Proof.

It's the best logic book I've ever used. Every human should have to reason about it.

!! Nicomachean Ethics

MTG Card Bookmark: Thirst for Knowledge, targeting the Unity of [[The Good]]. 

Hallowed ground. Dogeared the fuck out of this one in case anyone picks it up. So many [[gems]] and things to wrestle with.

!! Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals

MTG Card Bookmark: Apostle's Blessing, targeting the first formulation.

Preach, yo. Dogeared heavily, my heart raced through the book, as usual. Sleep with it under your pillow, folks.

!! The Republic

MTG Card Bookmark: Echoing Truth, targeting The Sun analogy.

All hail [[The Good]]! God damn. Get [[Straussian]], folks.

!! The Communist Manifesto

MTG Card Bookmark: Ardent Plea, targeting ??.

The ranger's not gonna like this one, Yogi. Too bad.

!! Das Kapital, 1984, Brave New World, The Prince, Manufacturing Consent

Don't have my copies anymore, unavailable and/or these were too expensive.
