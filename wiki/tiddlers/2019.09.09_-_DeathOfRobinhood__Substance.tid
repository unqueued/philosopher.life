Dear DEATH.ofrobinhood,

It's good to hear from you. The emphasis in your name has my attention. I take it I have much to learn about it.

<<<
Hi h0p3,

Selah and I met last October. She had come to my church during a weekday event to check it out for her brother, who was looking for a place that had services in the late afternoon. Everyone had gone out for a supper break together, while I slunk down to the basement because I needed to pray.
<<<

You and I have a great deal in common. I adore the way you "slunk," lol. Yeah, that's me too. I still do this a lot. My practice has changed over time, but I can appreciate the need. Do you still find yourself slinking and being alone these days?

<<<
I was just coming out of a depression triggered by my dad's death, coping with both my mom's health problems and some issues of my own, compounded by semi-isolation.
<<<

Wow. That's awful. You've suffered more than I could imagine. You've been on a rollercoaster these past couple years. I'm glad to see you still standing. Some of the most empathic people I have met are those who survived trauma, suffered, and grieved enormously. You pass through fire with grace. 

<<<
I'd been in and out of a couple of confusing relationships that, in hindsight, I was not in the proper headspace to pursue.
<<<

What made you ready this time? 

<<<
In the basement, I told God that I was lonely.
<<<

I'm sorry. Our loneliness may be different, but I can appreciate what it's like to be profoundly alone. 

This recently came up with my brother (we are both fun at parties): there is something called "[[Death Thought Accessibility|https://www.psypost.org/2019/09/study-existential-isolation-linked-to-increased-death-thought-accessibility-54347]]." Your name and emphasis are important to me. I often do not understand what people are saying to me. I'd like to know what you think about the idea.

<<<
I wasn't asking for anything, but my understanding of prayer is that it creates a space in which I can say true things, including about myself.
<<<

I know you would never treat prayer like you are just using some cosmic vending machine. It's serious.<<ref "w">> That practice has helped me habituate myself to talk about what matters most when I'm all alone or with others.

While not realtime, you are the first person I've prayed with in many years. I aim to honor the practice as best I can. I agree one can say true things in a prayer, and seeking or coming to terms with the truth during such moments is something I hold in high regard. Thank you for praying with me.

<<<
Back upstairs there were a handful of people still hanging out. I asked one guy if he wanted to go eat and we went to a hole in the wall nearby. While we were ordering, Selah walked by, saw us from the window, and came in.
<<<

I [[hope]] the scene is burned in your memory. I only have tiny semblances of it now a decade and half later. It's a precious moment. What were you eating?

<<<
Turns out she knew my friend from childhood and wanted to say hi. We talked a bit, and later that night we prayed together for this one anxious fellow who had come in off the street. It wasn't the time to ask her out because she was very occupied by her mom's then present hospitalization, but we'd noticed each other, and I thought she was cool.

We went on our first date a month and a half later.
<<<

Some people think less than a year is pretty quick. I don't have much experience in the matter, but my assumption is that sometimes when a person knows, they just know. It sounds like maybe you just know. When did you know you wanted to marry her? 

<<<
She had tried to wash out some of the drool and other work fluids from her shirt before we met which I took as a sign of interest.
<<<

Rofl. Perfect. =) I can only assume your killer sense of humor is something she prizes. 

I can see her walking through the door soaked in her work and you just run up to hold her. I bet she has some days which just take it out of her.

<<<
We've been...very involved with each other since.

♥♥♥
<<<

Noice. I'm glad. She is a bright light. I'm grateful you have each other. I can't imagine how people without spouses do it in the end; I'm surprised by the number of people who don't even want a spouse.

<<<
I guess that's my little answered prayer story about that. I've deliberately tried to write it de-frilled and un-mystified, though I can't fully avoid my tendency to assign narrative significance to life events.
<<<

This line is important for us. It may be a shift in our approach and locution. I want to make sure I'm meeting your preferences as best I can.

I am surprised by this line, but I take it as a gift in trying to meet me halfway, speak my language, given my context. It is rare that someone does that for me. I think it's quite charitable, especially because this story is exceptionally vital to you. Perhaps it's like painting in oversimplified black and white instead of high-resolution color. I am lucky to hear your story. Thank you.

Yes, I am dogmatically concerned with the very concept of objective significance [[itself]]. That makes me a terrible listening partner sometimes (my wife will be the first to stand up and shout that one). Insofar as subjectivity, including qualia, doesn't detract from the justified pursuit of the truth, I think those assignations are [[beautiful]]. I agree that none of us can fully avoid assigning narratival significance to our lives (nor even incorrectly, I fail often); perception logically implies it, and there would be nothing to talk about otherwise. It must be frustrating to speak with someone who isn't denying that you're experiencing but instead a crucial section of what that experience is of and corresponds to, but this is what philosophy is like.

For the record, I don't think you are frilly (seems like you live a very stripped down, materially simple, humble, and direct life to me); I don't mean to imply that either.<<ref "n">> Mystical, thank [[good]]ness, //yes//, but frilly or superfluous, //not at all//. You're a man of substance. You are intentional and deliberate (hopefully it takes one to know one here). The Mystical is no joke to either of us. You are serious as a heart attack to me. Please take this as the compliment it is: you are your [[faith]]. You live it. You could be tortured to death, and I know you still couldn't deny or unsee it. It's [[love]] to disagree at this level and still bind ourselves together in the dialectic. It's my honor.

Of all the people I speak with on this wiki, you submit to God openly. You just know it. It's wonderful to see someone actually mean it.

You may or may not like me, understandably (I appreciate your patience), but I like you DEATH.ofrobinhood. I'm going to offer my silence to you again. If you think you should say it differently to me, and if my argumentation and disposition are getting in the way, then please present it as you prefer and ask me to quietly listen.

Today I got news of a death. We met on the train during the years I'd moved back to take care of my mom. His life seemed the sort of bleak, absurd thing written by some godless tragedist. He wasn't objectively likeable, but we became friends. I'm glad we got a few years together.
<<<

I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad you were there for him too. I appreciate the way you sacrifice for others, especially for those who aren't likable. You [[love]] people wherever they are. Sometimes, you remind me of Saint Kant's //sad philanthropist//, and I mean that as incredibly high praise. Regardless of your feelings or outlook, you try to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. You are a man of moral merit. 

What was bleak, absurd, godless, or tragic about his life?


<<<
This week I was assaulted by my neighbour.
<<<

Yikes. Are you okay? 

<<<
I've lived above her for close to a year now. I know she's very lonely and abuses. Early attempts at friendship were rebuffed and now she hates me.
<<<

I'm sorry she feels that way. I can't see you as well as you can see me, but I have a hard time believing she could hate you for any rational reason. That is a terrible feeling, and I'm sorry for your suffering.

<<<
I'd like for her to be happy. The first time I'd prayed for her was a month after I'd moved in. I asked God for an opportunity to show her kindness. Later that evening I found her drunk out of her mind at the front door. She'd lost her keys. After searching the neighbourhood in the dark, we found the keys in her purse. When she was sober the next day, she thanked me with a McDonald's gift card. I'd thought it would be the beginning of a good neighbourly relationship, so there's a part of me that feels like I'd failed her by not following up with greater regularity and caring (although I recognize I can't be wholly responsible for her sour outlook on life).
<<<

I doubt you failed her, especially since you are a man with so much on his plate. I'm curious to know when one is justified in a sour outlook on life. Presumably, the causation for most people's outlooks on life, including hers, is the responsibility of billions of homo sapiens over time (herself included to some non-trivial extent). She's lucky to have such a good neighbor as yourself.

<<<
Anyway, let's do our best to love people, and to love God. We bear His Image, which means we function as the expressed loci of His will.

DEATH.ofrobinhood
<<<

Preach, yo! I'll agree that such an image is for the purpose of [[good]]will, though not all of us wield it as wisely as we ought. You close with what matters most. I wish I did more often. As a madman, I'm lucky to meet the remaining angels like yourself in the desert.

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
