* I really wanted to drop https://www.reddit.com/r/InconvenientDemocrats, but I probably need the signal as it ramps into 2020.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/ is gone. Capitalists can't actually appreciate the control problem effectively enough. These are reactionaries who are misdirecting blame.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/ is an interesting mix. I don't pull from it often, but sometimes it's right on the money. I appreciate some of the academic work in there too.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/ is meme candy for me. I've avoided it forever simply because I don't want to melt my brain with pure candy. I feel less alone there. Perhaps this one won't last long for me. I don't know.
** I'm keeping https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/ for roughly the same reasons.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/gwern/ has a high [[S2NR]]. There are some things which only show up there.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/ is on hiatus. I waste too much time there. It's not like I don't find anything worthy there, it's that it's not worth the effort.
* Farewell, https://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/. You were a catalyst to [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] and [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. Your quotes suck because your users are retarded.
* Buh bye, https://www.reddit.com/r/science/, I barely use you.
* I desperately want to leave https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/, but there's too much to think about there. I have to read my enemies.
** This is the heart of soul of it: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/. I do find some sane people there, at least at first glance.
* Tried https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/ again. There are some excellent threads there. It's hard to dig through the ocean of crazy for the fitting crazy.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/ is out too. I'm glad to have sifted through it, but I'm not learning anything. 
* https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/ continues to ask good questions and point out solid examples of problems which go well beyond Reddit within every 20 posts (and it's easy to chickensex). That seems like a place [[kicks]] would appreciate.
* The illustrious https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/ is out too. This one hurts to lose. It's so [[antipleonasmic]]. It's not relevant enough or I've seen it. There comes a point where years on a sub just hits diminishing returns. `/salute`. It was a wonderful titlesub.
* Flirted with https://www.reddit.com/r/topofreddit/ to keep abreast of the idiots. Nope. Kill me now. I don't care if I'm part of the conversation: virtually no one was going to listen to me.
** I don't really use https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/ much, but it's much closer to what I'm looking for. It's hard to give up on that much [[S2NR]]. 
* Also, `/wave` to https://www.reddit.com/r/Unhype/
* I think InconvenientDemocrats, LateStageCapitalism, lostgeneration form a solid trifecta of lowbrow maymays which everyone should plunder at least once.
* I'm down to 17 subs. Yay! =)
* I'm beginning to start using my frontpage and then heading to my multireddit for another look at my subs (which shows the neutral form). I do not know how the Reddit algo works and continues to evolve. I want to make sure I'm giving myself a second chance to improve the signaling I hand them (even if those signals are simply what I click on). 
* Running into the partial futility of shreddit; caching is more common.
* I rarely post anymore, and it's not important enough to put in my wiki. It reminds me of [[FTO: Ping]]. Now that I have [[Antipleonasm Analysis]], I can say my piece and just be done with it. Outside the wiki, I'm fairly low effort in my posting. I hope to find people to speak with at length over my wiki, but that isn't completely up to me.
