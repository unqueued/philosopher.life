title: Python: Tox-2-Wiki Text Formatter for Link Log

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# Parse the copy'n'paste into command line to clean it up for pasting straight into a link log. Presumably, it is already formatted, it just has some metadata on the front we don't like.

# Usage example from console: 
# ~$ wikireview.py "[11:34:20] asdf-123: * https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110411/full/news.2011.227.html
# [11:34:31] asdf-123: ** No, no, no. People are ideally rational, right?
# [11:42:02] asdf-123: * https://youtu.be/dbo1a5WzXX8
# [11:42:07] asdf-123: ** Beautiful, frisson"

# Just paste from your CnP clipboard!

# You'll want to install pyperclip
# sudo -H python2 -m pip install pyperclip
# sudo -H python3 -m pip install pyperclip
import pyperclip
import sys

# Parse text from command line argument
text = sys.argv[1].splitlines()

# Format and generate clipboard string
clipboard = ""
for line in range(len(text)):
    clipboard += text[line][21:] + "\n"

# This is magic I don't understand. Thank you. Just paste away!
pyperclip.copy(clipboard)
spam = pyperclip.paste()

```
