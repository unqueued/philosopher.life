H0P3

This letter is bullshit!

I enjoy Microsoft office word. The blinking cursor or whatever the fuck you call it is… mezmorizing. I can type faster than I can write and I have always loved that about computer. Of course now they have the speech to text stuff so you don’t even have to type. However, I enjoy taking the small opportunity to reread and easily edit in MS word.

I remember the first real computer we had that was hooked up to the internet. Wow. It was an IBM an had a windows 95 or maybe 98 and 1.2gb harddrive. I filled that bitch up with music I downloaded from the original napster. It wasn’t until Berea that I got a decent working computer that I could actually use and was my own. What a cool system they have there. I laugh though. People ask if I have seen this or that on the internet…. And my response is I went to a college with a bunch of poor weirdos and they gave us all laptops, high speed internet, and put us in dorms together. There isn’t much I haven’t seen!

I remember ryan Wilson changing my background to a bunch of gay guys so when I started it in class it would show up. I laughed. Then I changed his screen saver to some dude putting his finger thru his nose and into his eye socket. (he had no eye). Gross as shit. But I password protected it so he had to come get me to use his computer. We lived across the hall at the time. He did not find it nearly as funny.

I am not going to respond (mom called see below) to your response of my original letter. It seems like a year ago and just trivial.  (back to after mom called) 

Fuck my mom called. She talks as much as I do. She likes to drink beer and call friends and family. I am afraid I inherited that trait. Unfortunately, she is living in a really nice 5th wheel camper travel nursing. I know I have told you these things. Idgaf. I try to make time to talk to her because I know she is alone, lonely, and with my grandparents age I just never know what is going to happen. Going back up to finish prior sentence then moving fwd.

So you have mentioned that you didn’t pay a lot of attention to song lyrics. It’s like we aren’t even friends. This is how I KNOW our brains work differently. Also that other stuff you have going on. Lmao.

What is your brothers relationship with your parents like? Do they share the same feelings as you do? I am confused and suspect you must sincerely struggle with your own golden rule in treating and dealing with this situation… I am not poking or prodding you into any here. I just want everyone to make up, get along, respect and love one another. 

I find myself very frustrated with my coworkers and the never ending need to ridicule, humiliate, make fun of and try to irritate each other. I am ok with things to an extent. But groups have a tendency to take things to far. I see it, and I have been the target more than once. Thankfully I think quickly on my feed or when backed into a corner.

I almost quit my job today. Not because of anyone at work, it was actually I didn’t wanna drive to work! Lol. Had a hard time waking up at 4am. So my phone has a cool feature that you can schedule a text to send at a certain time. So I texted at 4am to text my lead at 530 that I was gonna be 7-8ish getting there. So I showed up to work over two hour late and my lead was like “whats up man, you have a good weekend?” I said “yeah it wasn’t bad, tired. Lol” he responded “ yeah we all need a little extra sleep sometime. And that was that. We continued partly working inbetween bullshitting and being lazy. It is really hard to leave a job that I don’t even talk to my boss daily. Where I can call in anytime I want (as long as I have time to cover it).  Guys start work at 5am and some don’t start until 9 or 10 or 11 some days. Just as long as you get your 40 somehow. Cant work over a 12hr shift and cant work on weekends on this project.

The last project hell you had 7 days to get your 40hrs in. lol and worked 24hrs m-f 

Blah, boredom and the time suck has really pushed me to revaluate doing something else.
I am currently in the process of apply for the sub teaching job. Like I should be finishing the application rather than writing you this letter.

So if you don’t listen to lyrics. You cant appreciate country music. Country music uses the music to emphasize the lyrics. But more often rock, rap, and other music is the music first and the melody and lyrics just add to the song. My wife is the same way. It drives me nuts.

So the girls and myself have been loving the YoYos I picked up. I got Samantha the auto retract style with the springs and weights. So it will automatically draw up right before it loses all of its spin. Or if you don’t sling it hard enough it will just go up and down. Wife has proved to pick it up quickly. I also got some better poly cotton blend strings that have made a difference. 

I tried the rubix cube for appox 4 hours or so. I wrote a handful of the basic algorithms together, I solved a lot of it. But I got frustrated when I would miss  a sequence and fuck up my progress. I felt like I was just staring at instructions and turning  the cube. It was not appealing. I suspect memorizing the turns would have helped,  I did the simple ones. But as moved down the cube the simple turns became more complex. Meh. I would like to be able to solve any 3x3 cube I pick up. But I am not willing to put the effort in. 

My back is healing incredibly well. I find myself forgetting and not even thinking about it more than thinking about it, depending on the day. This is huge. It has been almost 4 months since I went down.

I tried losing weight. I still am, but its like alcohol. Im in constant recovery. I fuck up once a week to once a month with alcohol. I fuck up a lot more with eating habits. And I have no energy to exercise. I am living on artificial energy anyway. (Another reason I want to quit my job, lose a bunch of weight, start a business, and be home more!) I would be willing to work the same number of hours if not more sometimes. But I wanna try being my own boss. Lots of workable ideas. I am just afraid to jump. I really am… and I cant move, I don’t wanna move.

Sounds like the wife pulling up and I am going to sit down and eat dinner with my girls. Check out “nailed it” on Netflix. It is a great family show. It is hilarious. It is a cooking competition but there isn’t the elimination humiliation. They take normal folks and give them crazy baking things to try. And its all fun and silly. Last episode the judges were making fun of and calling out a sound guy for sitting in the back playing on his phone, during the competition. I think you guys as a family would like it. You get to pick who you want to win, and watch them nail it or fail it.  Lol. Lots of funny fails but they aren’t snobby or ridiculed.  Just laughed with. The winner gets $10k. 

Talk to yea soon.
