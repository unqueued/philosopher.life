title: 2019.06.07 - TDL: Swim In The Rain

* Sex, for the love of all that is holy. What is taking us so long?
* We should swim, even if it rains. Grill dogs (especially the neighbors dogs, so much meat on them!) with mustard and onions.
** Dude, you didn't even get a single Walter Melon. They weren't that expensive, and it's okay if make mistakes.
* Bask in your reading and writing. It's wonderful to jump in.
* Maybe you should try out a movie or new show, eh?
* The house needs a cleaning, and your side table is disturbing. Cmon. You worked so hard to make it look spiffy. Don't disappoint future you and me, yall.
* Hey, you haven't been connecting well enough with some of the people you love.
** I bet [[JRE]] is feeling tired. Still try.
