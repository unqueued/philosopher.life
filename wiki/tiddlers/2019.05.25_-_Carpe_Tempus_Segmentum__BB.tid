title: 2019.05.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: BB

* Woke at 6
** Ugh. That was crap.
* Watched some shows, fell asleep again.
* Read+Write
* Never went swimming, and didn't exercise. That was my fault.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Grocery Shopping
* Pizza and beer
* BB marathon
* Nap
* Farted around, literally. This day has been great, lol!
* Clicker Heroes.
** I think the kids and I should work on AHK as a project. That is a tool which is radically underused in my experience.  It is so strong to me, I don't want to use Linux sometimes. If I built a DE, it would be with that kind of tooling in mind. 
** Maybe we could do some OCR too.
*** Should look at SwitchBlades with them too. Fun, weird, and powerful.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 3
