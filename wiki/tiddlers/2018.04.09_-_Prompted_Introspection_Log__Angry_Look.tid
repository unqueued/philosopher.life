title: 2018.04.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Angry Look

!! When you are angry, how do you look?

Angry for what reason, towards what or whom, regarding what or whom, given what context, and to what degree or kind? My anger and its appearance is a spectrum. Tell me the inputs, and I'll tell you the computed outputs as best I can predict/perceive. 

I will literally roar my words if I'm angry enough. I can also look completely blank when I'm angry.

I feel like I have more reasons to be angry than most. I think about the world a lot more. Have you seen my [[Link Log]]?
