title: 2017.07.26 - Carpe Diem Log

I had two ideas, and I didn't know where to put them where I know I'd read them. I need to rethink how I use {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]}. I need that random space, but I need order too. I'm not sure how to draw the lines and why. Here goes for the two ideas:

* I'd love to see the kids draw a map of our apartment complex.
* Perhaps my son would really love joining the Boyscouts (minus the patriotism).

Onto the log itself:

* I fell asleep a bit earlier last night, I slept. I wake up often throughout the night to look at the clock. It's just not my home. I'm more on edge. I finally just said fuck it and got up. Thankfully, there were only a few minutes until my alarm.
* I Pushed Bricks. Success!
* I worked hard.
** I'm glad I get to talk to Jaye.
** I'm liking Bull in a lot of ways.
*** He hasn't quite seen the full extent of my incompetence, I suppose.
* I stayed a bit later to talk with Bull and Spaz.
* I talked to my brother JRE.
** I feel bad that they missed out on Social Services coming for their final home visit before they are cleared. It sucks.
* I showered.
* I had my vid chat with my family.
** I dearly hope my children finish their work.
* Fireman time
* Surf, eat, and surf.
* Watched highlights of C9 vs. P1 from last weekend.
* Gonna watch some IASIP before sleeping.
