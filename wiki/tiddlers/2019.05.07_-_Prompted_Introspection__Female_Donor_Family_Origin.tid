title: 2019.05.07 - Prompted Introspection: Female Donor Family Origin

!! What state or country what is your mother's family from?

Poland, though I may have some Jewish lineage as well. There's an even higher psychopathy rate on that side of the family. The food is fine. Meh. It doesn't matter too much to me, though it does define me to some extent.
