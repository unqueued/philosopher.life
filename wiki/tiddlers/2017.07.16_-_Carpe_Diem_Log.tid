title: 2017.07.16 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up to wife initiating. Been a long time! I actually turned her down (was I crazy?) because I was just so sleepy.
* We laid in bed together and talked. It was wonderful.
* I played a game of league, and they went to church. I considered going, but realized would not have made a better day
* Instead, I went for DCK. I'm glad I did. It was difficult, but not too bad. I cried, which is something I rarely do on DCK itself (although after often enough).
* Everyone came home. We had family time on the bed just laying there and talking.
* I talked to ALM. He apparently reads the wiki. Hi, bro!
** We had some quick catchup. I've barely been able to contact anyone (and as you will find out, that trend is going to continue this week, hardcore-style)
* We had our family meeting.
** This one was difficult for everyone.
*** My son just straight up said he doesn't like me, wanted to keep his negative attitude/lense, etc. 
**** It took a long time to talk through it.
*** My daughter didn't do her work on her wiki, and it showed.
** By the end, we were glad we did it. We stuck through it, and it was worthwhile.
* The ladies cooked while the boys packed.
** I got my lunches and dinners mostly set. Should be quite healthy and something I can stomach on the jobsite, I believe. 
* We ate amazing chicken wings and fries. 
** We ate so amazingly this weekend.
* I left, drove almost all the way there, wanted to check the time and I found out I forgot my phone somehow. I was horrified.
** I doubled backed, but then I did the math and realized I would be arriving at 1am. I so much need my sleep I can't afford to do that. It's going to be an interesting week.
* I listened to Infomacry. At about the same I realized I didn't have my phone, all of the major "Information" internet services were disconnected around the world. It was kind of ironic in its annoying parallel to my own connection problem.
* I realized that I may be breaking out in hives due to stress. It broke out further on my arm during the trip after I realized the phone problem. This is good to know about my body.
* I arrived, and Armstrong had left me a note. My wife called. =) Hey babe!
* I put everything away, the new sheets on, and put the lotions on its skin.
* I couldn't connect to the internet, so my latest copy of the wiki isn't synced to this laptop, and thus I'm writing it in sublime text editor. 
* Time to relax and fall asleep to, /drumroll, Mr. Robot!
