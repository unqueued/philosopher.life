title: 2018.06.21 - Prompted Introspection: Causation

!! Would you be a different person today if you had a different childhood? How?

No shit, Samwise. Unlike Hume, I believe I'm epistemically justified in my belief in causation. Exactly "how" is not a fully solvable problem (physicists gonna cry, yo); there is an element of faith at the bottom (Hume is correct about the uncertainty, although he only wielded his philosophical view as a defense of his psychopathy).

Btw, you have to tell me the way in which my childhood might be different before I can offer a conjecture as to how my life would be different today. Your failure to indicate anything about it is part of the reason why I feel like you are really asking about causation itself.

I wish I had a real education growing up. That would have changed everything.
