title: 2018.01.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Kindest Person I've Met

!! Name one of the kindest people you have ever met. Why?

Ah, yes, another Sunday school question that you won't like my answer to. I'm not convinced kindness to others is real. I think such acts and their motivating maxims are generally reducible to selfishness. If you are willing to divorce these, then I think kindness is real. If you are willing to think that something non-selfish can truly emerge from selfish atoms, then perhaps kindness is real.<<ref "2019.03.23">> Otherwise, there is only kindness to one's self for a given context. Egoism done well in a time-slice; that's the purest form of kindness I've seen.

I think those who have ended their lives because they understand the pain of living is not worth it (at least in their case) have done themselves a kindness. I think those who take their medicine to get better have done themselves a kindness. I think feeding the poor to remove the pain of empathizing with their pain is doing ourselves a kindness. I think being selfish in the right ways, at the right times, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth, is kindness. 

One can be psychopathically kind! One can be an effective egoist! Of course, in the vast majority of circumstances, people aren't.

Of course, there is a part of me that wants to scrap everything I've said here. I don't know what to say. I'm trying to be honest about humanity. I don't buy the story humanity tells itself; I'm throwing up the koolaid.

I don't know who the kindest person I've met is. It's not easy to rank. I'm not qualified to answer the question.
