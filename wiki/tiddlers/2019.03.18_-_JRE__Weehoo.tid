My brother and I talked for 1.5 hours! Weehoo =)

He asked for pictures of the wall to give me ideas on how to do it. He is worried about humidity. He says it isn't up to code to do what I want to do, but doesn't think it will be a problem. 

He says the people at his work place really don't like me. Lol! Surprise! Apparently, it is evil that my children have tasted wine and beer before. I'm simply too permissive with them. ROFL. I feel caught between worlds, as usual. 

We talked about psychedelics, the kids, and our list of cringe moments. It was wonderful.

He talked to me about the wiki. He has clearly been reading, and I'm grateful.

Ketamine and depression got more than one round of talks. We talked about weighing.

I can't remember half of what we talked about. Still, it was amazing. I hope my unconscious parts soaked it up!
